Readers like SumUp are small enough to fit into your back pocket and as mobile as the smartphone used to help process payments. This means waitrons can carry their own readers, delivery people can process cards at clients’ doors, and on-site traders can control as many points of sale as they choose. The result is faster, superior service at a cheaper price. \n![accept credit cards](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/1ocN38lTqEgU6SuyOCiE4y/67e38d29b6e75646749f5280e00b3aea/accept-credit-cards.png)\nYour clients deserve only the safest, quickest payment methods, so only state of the art technology will do. Your point of sale system affects your bottom line in several ways, from limiting your expenses to raising your revenue. Don't let this critical part of your business fall between the cracks. \n\n## The Benefits of EMV Chips\nEMV chips come with significant benefits, not least of which is the size, economy, and portability of the latest machines. If you want to enhance your point of sale and cash ups, EMV readers will push you into a new era of ease and automation. Visa and MasterCard predicted that all U.S. retailers would be EMV compliant by the end of 2015. The reality is not quite as clear-cut. <a href=\"http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/emv-chip-cards-arrive-poll.php\">Seventy percent</a> of consumers had EMV cards in April 2016, yet nationwide, <a href=\"https://nrf.com/news/us-transition-emv-chip-cards-trudging-along\">only 20%</a> of transactions leveraged the security of this technology. Effectively, consumers are rearing to move ahead, but merchants are lagging behind. \n![benefits of emv chips acceptance](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/zSl4L3UuxUmoySW8giiq/2aa9ceb8a46ebfcbbb5622b1ad6d9e10/benefits-of-emv-chips-accepting.png)\nChip technology has been a contentious issue in the United States, largely on the back of misunderstandings about its benefits and features. EMV card processing is no longer as sluggish as many merchants believe. In fact, today’s machines can process a payment within seconds. Chips have even had a success rate of almost 100% at reducing credit card fraud, and now, with card readers as light and economical as SumUp, they can change the way retailers do business. \n\n## How It Works\nEMV stands for Europay, Mastercard, and Visa, the three most popular chip cards. Client data is kept on a computer chip that will soon replace magnetic strip technology entirely. In the past, hackers could gain access to credit card information all too easily, but chip technology is quickly eradicating this form of theft. \n\nA standard credit card machine is expensive, packing fee upon fee without offering any significant security benefits. Chip processing time is steadily being cut, too. In September 2016, the general speed of an EMV reader was already at 4.2 seconds. \n\n## The Liability Shift\nRetailers are falling behind with their chip card payments at enormous risk. The U.S. liability shift is already in full swing, effectively ending the budget-friendliness of magnetic strip payments. With responsibility for fraud chargebacks having shifted onto retailers’ shoulders should they not have an EMV reader, your lack of chip technology could cost you dearly. \n![take credit card payments after liability shift emv chip](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/IK4tyQKEQS0wEwCuaISU4/55b8b75c7bcd67c69a56d7f06f68f862/take-credit-card-payments-liability-shift-emv.png)\nMaestro, Visa, MasterCard, and American Express have already finished the general retailing shift. In October 2017, the final stage will be completed when credit card companies shift liability at pay-at-pump gas stations. Nine out of 10 U.S. consumers say they’ve tried to pay a merchant who wasn’t EMV compliant in the last six months. The ability to accept credit cards payments that are EMV-compliant is essentially an insurance policy against fraud and an impressively economical one at that: A contactless SumUp terminal comes with no cancellation or flat fees at a meagre price of 2.7% of each transaction. No intelligent insurer would sell a policy at such a rock bottom rate, and yet EMV “insurance” is available to every merchant in the country at precisely that price. \n\n## Why Chip Technology?\nEMV credit card payment systems have been introduced specifically to prevent criminals from creating clone cards, but they also protect consumers from identity theft. Not all readers that accept credit cards are created equal, though: some send unencrypted data over a network, which exposes the card to theft. This is why SumUp encrypts all data that’s put through the terminal. \n\n## EMV for Advanced Users\n\nSDK and API integration means your SumUp terminal can leverage merchant account resources in a customized way, too. API stands for “application program interface”, which lets you decide how your software interacts with other programs and apps. SDK stands for “software development kit”. This gives you the power to create your own applications to interact with your software, hardware, and operating system. \n\nCheckouts can be accessed online and via mobile, which means your point of sale is as ever-present as the internet is. Server communication with SumUp is possible, so if you have the expertize to create your own integrated checkout form, the option is available to you. If you prefer to manage it simply, a form is provided to use as-is or to customize. Don’t let SDK and API-integration intimidate you — SumUp will accept credit cards as soon as it’s connected to a device, no complicated coding or handlers needed. API and SDK are merely provided to serve merchants who prefer to take the reigns of their point of sale systems. \n\n## How it Works\nImplementing EMV couldn’t be easier. The card is “dipped” rather than swiped. The information on the chip is validated as legitimate while you're accepting your credit card payments, and, within a few seconds, the payment is processed. The money is then put into your account within the next 24 hours. Your cash ups are handled by the native application, and you can accept credit cards on iPhone and Android. The reader uses Bluetooth technology to connect to a mobile device carried by your employees and uses the phone or tablet’s keyboard when needed.\n\n## Seventies Technology\nMagnetic strip technology is antiquated. It was introduced to the market in the disco era, so it’s not surprising that data breaches are happening as a result. Trump Hotel is the most recent example, with a massive loss of consumer information in over six states late in 2015. Some firms have been hit twice in the same year, while others have fallen victim to a different kind of crime. Hackers gained access to Target and Home Depot systems through magnetic strip cards, leaving viruses on their cash registers. U.S. banks have changed their card payment systems for excellent reason: identity theft and credit card fraud are among the most serious cybercrime challenges facing America today. The solution is an easy one: accept credit cards with chips instead of using their magnetic strips. \n\n## Accounting\nWhen you take credit card payments, your machine gathers all the data your accountant needs to document your sales and stock movements. SumUp’s dashboard lets you export your sales data to an Excel file daily, weekly, or monthly. Receipts can also be emailed or attached to a compatible printer, but it’s the Excel export function that will give your business incredible power. Because Microsoft Office integrates with an array of free analytics tools, chip technology gives you tabulated data that your marketing and accounting departments once paid a fortune for. \n![accounting benefits accept credit cards payments](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/3rqYvQNS3YmeK24yWaMYKs/749fa44098febf0b97daae053ff48950/accounting-accept-credit-cards-payments.png)\nYour bookkeeping can now be finished in a quarter of the time, and your clients’ details are delivered to your desktop. Marketing data has never been easier to access. You can assess the buying habits of your clients, the quality of your leads, and how high your customer retention rates are. Adjust and hone your approach using your analytics as a guide, and your profits will rise. Accepting EMV credit card payments is your one-stop ticket to escalating revenue. \n\n## Reputation Matters\nWhen you choose how you’ll accept credit cards payments, you’re not making a basic one-off decision about a product. The business who takes care of your chip transactions will be an important partner for years to come. It’s critical to choose a brand that regularly updates its applications and hardware to suit evolving advancements and risks. Find a reader that has already proven its mettle in accepting credit card payments offshore, and look for outstanding merchant services ratings. Uptime should be as close to constant as possible, and support must, of course, be easily accesible. \n\n## Scalability\nThe way you accept credit cards payments must support your company’s growth. If you’re a small business, a reader designed for large-scale corporations that can afford extreme fees won’t serve you. If you’re a new, growing business, however, your reader must support you for at least the next five years. It must handle your stock control competently today and years from now. The only rational way to cope with this degree of scalability is by partnering with a brand that charges a percentage of your transactions without flat fees. \n\n## Your Business, Your Way\nIt’s tempting to get stuck in stasis when it comes to your business model if your point of sale is limited to your company premises. SumUp invites you to think outside the box. Now that your card payments are fully mobile, think about how you can leverage your new freedom. Will you add a mobile or e-commerce branch to your site? Will you franchise it or hire remote workers? The only limit is your imagination. Think big, and SumUp will grow to suit your ambitions.","fullWidthImage":{"id":"6snxwGIA7Y4cIUeSKM44q6","updatedAt":"2017-06-26T10:59:48.484Z","title":"sumup credit card reader and smartphone","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/6snxwGIA7Y4cIUeSKM44q6/93f38ae1c8e28f8d4df568a4792ffffa/sumup-credit-card-reader.jpg","details":{"size":107321,"image":{"width":1920,"height":932}},"fileName":"sumup-credit-card-reader.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"secondaryContent":"## SumUp offers you the best solution in card payments\nWith SumUp, you can quickly and easily accept credit and debit card payments with your smartphone or tablet.\n\n<div class=\"btns btns--seo\">\n  <a href=\"https://sumup.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=accept-credit-cards\" class=\"btn btn--cta\">\n  Learn more about SumUp!\n  </a>\n</div>","seoLinks":"### Popular articles\n\n- [A Credit Card Machine with Built In Ambition](https://sumup.com/credit-card-machine?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=accept-credit-cards) - Do you know that you can start accepting all credit card payments within few days without contract and hidden fees?

In fact, a processor with precisely those traits could even send your profits soaring if it has enough software compatibility to enhance your marketing and reduce your staffing needs. If that sounds too good to be true, you’ve not stumbled on SumUp, the credit card machine for small business that provides every Point of Sale (PoS) service a growing company needs to transform into a retail giant. \n\nCredit card processing can be approached without much thought if you’re a big business with an even bigger expense account to support your freedom. If you own a small or mobile business, you need to think a lot harder about your approach, but this doesn’t relegate you to a fee-heavy processor. Your PoS strategy is only restrictive if you have the wrong service provider.\n\nToday’s processors must, of course, be EMV-compliant, but new entrepreneurs need mobile credit card machines that do more than the bare minimum: There should be no revenue requirements to limit the scalability of your processing power and no list of processing fees longer than your business’ monthly general ledger. Choose a greedy processing firm and you’ll become weighed down by per-transaction verification fees, gateway and statement charges, and a percentage dollar charge on every sale. Fortunately, the power of choice has shifted away from banks to third party middlemen, so competitive terms have become a reality. You no longer need to spend more on your card processing than you do on your banking. \n\n## The Basics\nEMV stands for Europay, Mastercard, and Visa, but the term represents credit and debit cards that carry their own computer chips. All data is held on that chip, which is almost impossible to counterfeit. The U.S.A’s liability shift is in full swing, which means that if you don’t have the capacity to process EMV cards, you will be held financially responsible for any fraud attached to the payments you process. The risk is extreme but easy to avoid. Once you’ve moved beyond the old fashioned credit card swipe machine, you will also need to protect against identity theft. Surprisingly, this is not a feature most processors offer, but SumUp does. \n![card machine security standard](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/3y1P70vPw4KaGCmuuAqa4C/a9157fccb7260a0473f5704a7ca79c3b/card-machine-security.png)\n## Small Does Not Equal Incomprehensive\nIn the past, if you wanted 24/7 support, affordable fees, and absolute security, you had to pay a pretty penny. These days, highly competitive processors are offering staunch security at a negligible cost to you, along with extra features to sweeten the deal. \n\nWhat if your card machine had the power to restructure your PoS so that it kept your stock figures up to date, streamlined your cash ups, reduced the hours spent on bookkeeping, and gave your marketers valuable information about your buyers? What if your wireless credit card machine encrypted your customers’ data without tying your sales staff to a cash register? Points of sale just went mobile, so it’s time merchants raised their expectations. \n\n## Understanding Credit Card Machine Rates\nCost-benefit analysis of EMV technology can only weigh in favor of chip and sign processing considering the millions that are lost to fraud each year, but fee profiles are not all made equal. Debit rates for card processing average at 1.35%, but clients still need to pay their portion, which can be as much as 4%. Flagship services usually charge percentages of the sale on top of a flat fee of 19 to 30 cents per transaction. Monthly service fees and the like can raise your expenses considerably, but an inferior card machine comes with indirect costs as well: \n- Functionality that lacks intuitiveness can cost thousands in staff training.\n- Terminals sold at a flat rate can cost up to $1, 000 upfront.\n- Machines that process cards sluggishly can cost you profits from lost sales.\n- A payment system that doesn’t travel is less streamlined and efficient, obliterating your flexibility.\n- $8.6 billion was lost to credit and debit card fraud in 2014.\n- Shoddy systems store critical data on the device, making it vulnerable to theft.\n- Where support is not provided 24 hours a day, lost sales aren’t always easy to regain.\n![list of credit card machine rates](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/5sOaHaocPSWIa2uKcGoc4s/23f9daa835e543cba3e8b295346720fe/credit-card-machine-rates-list.png)\nWhen you’re looking at inferior processors, you’re unlikely to find a credit card machine for small business that is equally adept at running high volume and mobile payments. A fully scalable processor like SumUp is created specifically to suit a growing enterprise, so flexibility is built into every aspect of its design from processing technology to fee structures. With no flat fees, a low percentage of each transaction charged, extreme ease of use, and some of the best security features on the market today, SumUp keeps costs at ground zero, where they should be. That’s a cost-benefit analysis that any business owner can smile at. \n\n## Your Credit Card Machine, Your Way\nUntil recently, Paypal was among the only so-called card processors that travelled. Although it’s technically not a credit card processor, it was one of the rare ways small businesses could process card payments made from across the country or even the world. The industry has evolved, and now mobile credit card machines are stepping up to replace antiquated payment strategies. Away from the online marketplace, the only flexible alternative was once a customized system, which carried enough expenses to leave you shivering under your desk in terror. The solution isn’t as complex as you might think: a bespoke credit card machine for small business simply needs to charge a percentage of your sales so that your rates shrink and grow with your revenue. \n\nYour PoS is incomplete without software to support your bookkeeping, so SumUp lets you export your data to Excel, which is compatible with a number of accounting and marketing applications. Such a processor uproots your business, allowing your point of sale to travel to the other side of the shop floor and the other side of the world. A portable credit card machine can enhance your business model and even increase the size of your demographic. \n\n## Security Challenges\nYour credit card machine is no longer just a processor. It records your clients’ data, and that means you must live up to <a href=\"https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2011/04/DDP2015_United_States.pdf\">privacy regulations</a> unique to your industry. SumUp card reader protects businesses facing the following risks: \n- Medical institutions must live up to HIPAA privacy regulations that protect patient data. Not keeping to the policies will be considered a healthcare breach by The Department of Health.\n- As a financial services provider, you’re held to the standards of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n- Insurers are held to standards similar to those of HIPAA.\n- A violation of privacy laws can be enforced even in less regulated sectors.\n\nSince financial account numbers are considered sensitive data and thus more stringently governed, any merchant processing cards needs to comply with the law. Data protection is monitored by a number of different regulatory bodies, but it’s secured by one simple feature: end-to-end encryption. SumUp’s chip and sign machine encrypts data before transmitting it. It’s not rocket science, but it’s impressive nonetheless.\n\n## Myth Busting\nPeople resist change, regardless of how positive it is. The only serious complaint U.S. consumers have levied against EMV processing has to do with the speed of payments, but the truth is easy to swallow. Most chip and sign readers process cards in only a few seconds, so you can look forward to shorter queues and happier customers. As technology improves these speeds will vie against those of foreign countries which are processing cards in under a second. \n\nMerchants tend to think setting up their applications and readers requires the equivalent of a doctorate. Today’s best readers are like turnkey businesses: they operate the instant you begin to trade. Applications are intuitive to install, and fee structures are uncluttered. Employees don’t even need to be trained to keep your internal security measures intact because your reader will do that for you automatically. \n![credit card machine via bluetooth](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/2J21DmHdH28imcyICg0SMK/2388ec6127f3948c89b33fc29f0566af/credit-card-machine-bluetooth.png)\n## How it Works\nSumUp’s Air is as compact a reader as you’ll find. It communicates with mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets via Bluetooth. It uses your iOS or Android device’s keypad and travels well. The fee structure is such that you can have multiple readers in operation simultaneously, and your employees can carry their own readers from door to door or table to table. A single-use transaction code is created for each payment and sent to the card issuer for verification. \n\nA worthwhile reader should do more than merely process payments. It should make your POS procedure as fast, simple, and secure as possible, always putting the customer first.

The U.S. only made the switch to EMV technology in 2015, and retailers are still unsure about how it affects them because it’s all buried in verbiage. \n\n## What is EMV?\nEMV stands for Europay, Mastercard, and Visa, although it represents all chip and sign cards. The only reason these particular international card behemoths are featured in the acronym is that they started the evolution of credit card payment and represent the global standard for enhanced security. EMV technology is simply chip-based credit cards that hold and transmit data to a reader during payment processing. The USA currently requires buyers to use both their chip and signature for card payments. \n![credit card payment with emv](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/4uuOf27kPe4IIgK4ayaGIU/814fa3eb95f65b20d76cfc2ac5857d49/credit-card-payment.png)\n## Why Was the USA Late to Adopt EMV?\nAlmost every country in the world has adopted EMV already. The USA has lagged behind because it distrusted the quality of chip-based security. Its reluctance was unfounded: Chip cards have almost eradicated brick and mortar credit card fraud. Globally, only two contactless models have emerged on a grand scale: EMV and magnetic strips. The difference between the two is a simple one: EMV chips create new transaction numbers with every payment, whereas magnetic strips only carry one. This makes counterfeiting possible, which is why EMV has had such a potent impact on overseas credit card fraud. Countries like France, Thailand, and Canada had embraced EMV before 2011, so this technology has enjoyed a long and successful trial overseas. \n\nEMV technology has created a central body that will work together to overcome any security issues that may emerge in the future. This collaboration will have outstanding payoffs for merchants, making it possible to solve problems faster and more thoroughly. \n\n## How Will Mobile Payments Be Affected by the Shift?\n\nEMV has introduced a generation of mobile contactless technologies, but as yet, only readers have evolved to full mobile saturation. The use of smartphones instead of credit cards is steadily growing, but whether this mode of payment will take over the market entirely remains to be seen. Mobile readers like SumUp make use of merchants’ phones to transmit information from card to network, usually through Bluetooth technology. The card market is fairly fragmented in that there are several different modes of processing and networks, a problem that EMV will solve. \n\n## What is Near Field Communication?\n\nNear field communication (NFC) is emerging alongside Bluetooth as a leading wireless technology for contactless card payments. It’s rudimentary in comparison to Bluetooth and far more sluggish, connecting within six seconds. Given that the industry now processes entire payments within three seconds, NFC cannot live up to buyer expectations. NFC can also communicate over only a four-centimeter distance in comparison to Bluetooth’s 30 feet. \n\n## What About Mobile Wallets?\n\nMobile wallets emerged as an option many years ago, but they’ve not kept up with the media’s optimistic projections. They attracted little interest from merchants and fell behind when EMVCo technology became possible. This new form of EMV will eventually place all your credit, debit, and insurance data on a single smartcard, which will be far more powerful than a standard smartphone wallet. Multi-application plastic wallets are likely to be embraced on a wide scale in the future, making the shift to EMV all the more important for retailers who want to accept credit card payments using technology that’s consistent with industry standards. \n\nMobile credit card payment that connects buyer smartphones to merchant devices still requires a chip or SD card to be installed. Since EMV cards require nothing more than a budget-friendly piece of plastic, they’ve overtaken smartphone wallets and fulfilled security needs more robustly than phone payments ever could\n\n## What is the Liability Shift?\nTo encourage chip card payments, card brands required merchants without EMV compatibility to cover their fraud losses if they’d not yet made the shift by October 2015. Retailers lose [$580.5](https://wallethub.com/edu/credit-debit-card-fraud-statistics/25725/) million to debit card fraud each year. The federal card network policy protects buyers from liability for fraudulent transactions, but until 2015, merchants were shielded from it too. Card issuers will bear fraudulent losses as long as you have an EMV reader, making this technology one of the cheapest “insurance policies” you’ll ever have. Most US consumers now have chip cards, and while the technology isn’t bulletproof, it’s resulted in a drastic drop in 'card present fraud'. \n![emv card payment prevent fraud](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/4XRjUwV8U0iYGGEoIkEgyg/0f34f2c530d704cea038035252771ea9/emv-card-payment.png)\n## How Does EMV Prevent Card Present Fraud?\nEvery time you accept credit cards payments, they become vulnerable to chip and skim attacks, which clone cards to process fraudulent transactions. Cambridge University’s security researchers have found that the best way to avoid card present attacks is to implement EMV securely according to industry standards. Certified terminals make cards harder to counterfeit, which is why fraud is steadily moving to online payment ecosystems, but merchants still hold plenty of sway over how secure their EMV implementation will be. A secure credit card payment app adds power to an already sturdy technology. Look for an application certified by EMVCo with end-to-end encryption. Each transaction should verify that the card is present and “engaged” in the transaction—in other words, that the card and its user are at the transaction site. \n\nTo achieve this, a secret encryption key is authenticated as a part of each transaction. Only the card and issuer have access to it, and it can’t be taken from a previous transaction. If fraudsters can access that number, the entire system falls short. This is why encryption is so important. Your reader should process a credit card without sending critical information into cyberspace. SumUp terminals make it difficult to process stolen data by not making that data available in the first place. Think of encryption as invisible prison bars—it’s that much harder to cut through something you cannot see. \n\nFrance adopted EMV before most other nations, and today it loses about $436 million a year to credit card fraud to [the USA’s $3.1 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/419628/payment-card-fraud-losses-usa-by-type/). Much of the improvement is because malware is difficult to deploy on a credit card payment machine with a secure application program interface (API). \n\n## What is an API?\nAn API is an interface used to create your credit card payment app. It’s responsible for processing your transactions, keeping track of your stock, and controlling loyalty programs. APIs can’t offer reasonable security unless they’re designed for their unique purpose. A one-size-fits-all approach is no approach at all. \n\nSince your API can access every dark corner of your system and its resources, the way it’s used is critical to fraud prevention. Today’s invincible app is tomorrow’s vulnerable one, so when you choose a processing partner, look for one that evolves with the market and its threats. For the moment, the secret codes used in authentication are nearly impregnable, but leading card companies are constantly updating their apps so that the walls they build remain as solid as they’ve always been. SumUp doesn’t merely accept credit cards payments, it maintains your security over the long-term, much like an armed response unit. It also adds value to your point of sale by introducing functions like inventory control and couponing. If you’ve always wanted to launch a loyalty program but have lacked the capital to implement it, your SumUp reader will make it possible without demanding an upfront fee. \n\n## iOS SDK 9\nIf you or your staff are Apple users, SumUp uses iOS 9 SDK to accept credit card payments instead. This environment requires a secure connection in order to work, or the entire transaction is blocked. Security needn’t be complicated to be effective, and this is a prime example of simplicity at its most powerful. \n\n## How Flexible is EMV?\nSome readers can only process contactless transactions, others manage contactless and magnetic strip, and still others handle EMV. Since traditional solutions like magnetic strips are still in use in the USA, merchants can only serve all buyers if they accept all three payment configurations. SumUp serves every form of card payment, leaving none of your buyers out in the cold. \n\n## How do Fraud Reports Work?\nIf a buyer’s bank asks for more data about a transaction and it is disputed, a fraud report notification is generated by the bank. Credit card companies also use a range of other protective measures like irregular account activity alerts and pre-purchase verifications. Suspicious transactions are verified directly with the card user via email or phone--just one more way EMV keeps you and your customers safe. \n![fraud reports credit card payment](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/2ax2UZbMxqsQS6uAE4eY08/bf323decd83666cad6337538355e7bfb/fraud-reports-credit-card-payment.png)\nBuyers’ experience at your point of sale is an inherent part of their experience of your brand. A feeling of safety is integral to that. A reliable cyber security system can produce returns of as much as [100% or $40, 000](http://www.csoonline.com/article/3010007/advanced-persistent-threats/how-to-calculate-roi-and-justify-your-cybersecurity-budget.html) a year in savings alone, making it one of the most important investments you can make. Contactless solutions are often as close to free as the industry can manage, contributing to your profits in enough ways to overjoy your marketing team. If it’s revenue you want, SumUp will lead you to it.

When John Biggins developed the first credit system in 1946, charge cards were nothing more than rudimentary slips of paper, but within four years, the credit industry was booming. Diners Club was first to jump on the bandwagon, followed swiftly by American Express in 1958. By the time the swinging Sixties rocked and rolled their way into the world, MasterCard and Amex were thriving. Neither credit card companies could have imagined how far their innovations would evolve. Today’s systems use radio frequency identifications, antennae, and microchips to process payments anywhere at any time. Few wallets in the USA lack a microchip. The next growth spurt will come from online card payments processing, as mobile wallets, transportable point of sale devices, and biometric security systems overtake the market.\n\n## Preparing for Tomorrow's Payment Processing Technology Today\n\nMuch of the POS industry’s future will simply be more widespread versions of the technology that’s already available today. Mobile processing will one day create the first truly cashless society. [Contactless payment systems with biometric authentication](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2014/10/18/mastercard-zwipe-fingerprint-sensor-credit-cards/#ac8143010817) were introduced to Asian markets in April 2017. These systems will soon use palm vein patterns and iris recognition without the need for batteries. Today’s retailers are thus left with only two options: to introduce EMV payment systems as a foundation for the coming years or sink under the weight of the innovations that are about to dominate the business world. The security offered by the EMV technology in use today is unparalleled, and while mobile card processing will soon be the new global standard, the only way to gain that functionality is through EMV implementation.\n![credit card processing safety emv technology](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/12YF8fLCOiWEucYesaYI2g/973f4444da769b410c56eb8703d5eb9e/credit-card-processing-safety.png)\n## EM What? \n- EMV is the technology created by Europay, MasterCard, and Visa to allow terminals to connect directly with a card’s microchip, which generates a cryptogram to prevent fraud and theft. In simple terms, EMV chips are like tiny computers that carry and transfer information to and from mobile devices.\n- Contactless mobile payments can be achieved with NFC (near-field communication) or the more advanced Bluetooth technology. These techniques are often misunderstood to be independent of EMV, but they’re actually extensions of chip and sign cards. For this reason, EMV implementation is the only way to lay the foundation for future advances.\n\n### The United States Steps into the Race\n\nAlthough the United States only implemented EMV as a national standard recently, many facets of it are already mandatory. The 2015 liability shift placed responsibility for card fraud firmly on business’ shoulders if they lacked EMV technology. The only way to insure yourself against liability is by processing EMV cards, but not doing so is doing your customers a disservice, too. Magnetic stripes are easily replicated because they store information that never changes. Counterfeiters can thus easily convert them into cash. EMV chips generate a new transaction number every time they’re used. They can’t be duplicated in traditional ways, and as long as your reader encrypts all the data it receives, EMV protects against identity theft as well.\n\nHistorically, the credit card sector has only used partial solutions to theft to save pennies in exchange for exorbitant credit card processing fees. EMV is the first sound investment into fraud protection made by the industry in years, and it’s come with even lower fees for its users. For example, industry leader, SumUp charges no monthly costs or fixed fees. Only one fee is ever levied per transaction, and it’s calculated as a percentage of the payment. Credit card processing for small business has at last become a viable option, even for companies that need to manage transactions at their clients’ doorsteps.\n\n### Your Future through Analytics\n\nTomorrow’s business world will be more automated and artificially intelligent than even George Orwell could have imagined, but analytics and AI are already raising profits today. The days when credit card payment processing was simply a method of payment are over. Today, your card reader is not just a POS system, but a business partner, gathering information that can enhance every aspect of your business from its executive management to its accounting. The data captured by credit card processing machines is valuable, and it can be converted to insights that affect your bottom line. The key to creating a flexible analytics strategy lies in the universality of its software. Credit card processing that feeds data into programs like Excel immediately gains the capacity to extract information from a huge range of compatible analytics applications. Card payments processing can integrate with your:\n- Payroll and human resources management by recording each staff member’s sales and hours.\n- Marketing department by gathering Information about your current promotions and campaigns. This way, marketers can adjust and improve on their efforts while gathering information about your demographic.\n- Loyalty and gift card programs.\n- Accounting department by automating cash ups and other aspects of bookkeeping.\n- Product research and development including niche industry insights such as restaurant menu optimization and shift preparation.\n![payment processing actionable analytics](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/48kQacQxZS6E4UQySwKSmS/16dc7b8c41745010d15c1ab1bc05ec82/payment-processing-analytics.png)\nActionable analytics can be taken to their zenith with API-created applications that link to your credit card processing reader. They will turn your data into visual information and provide static dashboards so that you can achieve flexibility with your metrics and small data. This way, you’ll be able to monitor your sales as they relate to any corresponding promotions, product lines, or human resources strategies you’ve implemented. You belong to the era of big data. All you have to do to benefit from it is choose a credit card payment processing tool that can integrate with API applications.\n\n## The Mobile Credit Card Processing Generation\n\nOne day, simply tapping one device to another will be enough to process a payment, but merchant credit card processing has already shifted into a mobile landscape. Seven percent of Android users and 17% of Apple users had used mobile credit card processing by the end of 2015. The trend had a patchy beginning, partially disrupted by the EMV revolution, which offered better technology than mobile alone could provide. Tap-to-pay technology is still evolving, with wrist devices and the like entering the market. As mobile credit card processing becomes more secure, smartphones will become a more common way to handle contactless payment processing. Until then, readers like SumUp are small and mobile enough to travel door to door or table to table. Credit card payment processing has changed the way businesses operate, allowing them to accept payments online and off from anywhere, as long as there’s a mobile phone or tablet in reach.\n\n## The Future of e-Commerce\n\nCharles Stack created the world’s first online store in 1992, three years before the internet became fully commercialized. Globalization is now in full swing, and in the coming decade, Inc.com projects that the boundaries between on and offline businesses will evaporate. If you think the internet is the marketplace of the future, though, you’d be wrong. M-commerce (mobile commerce) is expected to be the next giant trend, leading point of sale systems globally. Automated payment processing will detect client preferences and their price sensitivity so that card processing can integrate more thoroughly into your marketing strategy. Customized card payments processing will eventually advance to offer each unique buyer a specialized pricing and payment structure so that you lose fewer shoppers at the point of sale, but it’s not too early to start putting personalized programs in place.\n\nSumUp gives you access to a wide range of payment applications through API management tools. API stands for application programming interface, and it lets you create applications and services that “plug” into your reader. Technophobes needn’t worry about development—there are a host of applications ready and waiting for you that can manage subscription plans, automate your billing, and manage your inventory. API can turn credit card processing for small business into an automated, highly intelligent business analyst who interacts uniquely with every buyer you have.\n\n## The Credit Card Crisis\n\nCredit card data breaches have been a sore point in the industry for years, and their costs seep into the lives of your buyers as much as they detract from your revenue. Customers can and do move onto alternative retailers if they feel your payments aren’t secure enough. The press is quick to publish every data breach catastrophe that happens, frequently creating a social media crisis of epic proportions that affects you more than you might realise. EMV has created a significant dent in these numbers in all 80 of the countries that have used it. Retailers experienced a [26% drop in card counterfeiting](http://www.businessinsider.com/visa-emv-cards-are-reducing-fraud-2016-6) year over year due to EMV migration. Contrast that to the annual 20.6% increase in card fraud until now and you find chip and sign technology is winning the race.\n\nHistory proves that theft will always evolve with the technology that fights it, and a 2016 Iovation/Aite Group study found that the majority of tomorrow’s credit card fraud will come from payments processed online without a card. In other words, the mobile and chip card revolution will do precisely what it was intended to do: eradicate card counterfeiting.\n\n## Your Point of Sale, Tomorrow\n\nWhen whisky dealer, James Ritty, developed the first point of sale system in 1879, he called it “incorruptible.” It was a simple tool to prevent staff thefts, but it was the first step towards what has become a $36 billion industry. It was only in the disco era that cash registers became computerized. By 2014, m-commerce solutions became the sector’s most important technological advancement, with chip and sign cards following closely behind. Today’s POS system doesn’t wait for buyers to come to it—it travels to customers wherever they are, but an even bigger revolution is on the way. Experts predict that, by 2020, the POS sector will be worth around $150 billion. This projection is critical to the way you handle purchases today because it spells out how sophisticated your POS strategy needs to be if it’s to compete. An EMV-based POS is, however, one of the cheapest ways to gain market share.\n![mobile credit card processing devices](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/4bbTw6Vtg4yeESg0u8og4M/5113691b35e7a9ec06e2cde78123d34e/mobile-credit-card-processing.png)\n## Your Future, the Profitable Way\n\nYour credit card processing system is only as useful as its software, which needs to support every operating system, integrate with all your other programmes, and fit seamlessly into your point of sale strategy. SumUp’s software development kit 9SDK) functions on Android and iOS. Transaction IDs are generated for each payment, and sensitive information is kept off your phone.

Imagine paying only for the cards you process. Imagine a reader that uses any iOS or Android device as its hub. Imagine a point of sale that’s as mobile as your delivery team. SumUp has at last directed its attention towards U.S. soil after a successful launch in the UK. The mobile point of sale company has stretched to include some 15 countries, and its success can be pinned on one simple fact: This is a reader that focuses on what businesses need from their readers, and not what banks want. This way, your profits go where they belong: in your account. \n\n## The End of Credit Card Fraud in One Simple Step\nPayment nightmares had become so all-encompassing in 2015 that the USA was responsible for <a href=\"http://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/86413-of-the-worlds-credit-card-fraud-happens-in-the-us\">47% of the world’s credit card fraud</a>. Chip and sign cards are a seamless and airtight solution that have already proven themselves in UK markets, yet the U.S. is dragging its feet on the transition to EMV technology. The sluggishness hasn’t gone unnoticed. Fraudsters have been working overtime to exploit magnetic strip technology before the U.S. draws a line underneath the chip and sign transition. Criminals pushed counterfeit card fraud up by 12.5% in a bid to benefit from the lack of security while they still can, but that’s not the absurd part. That label goes to the fact that those who don’t have an EMV credit card reader now have to cover the fraud loss themselves. All that’s required to bolster your business’ liability is the capacity to process chip and sign cards. Think of it as your insurance policy.\n![mobile credit card reader fraud security](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/yrRW8mD2NMgkAaiggOiWa/6ddde252ede4b50d7f291d7add1aa168/mobile-credit-card-reader-security.png)\n## Making Sense of the Change\nEMV technology operates through a chip that’s kept on the client’s card. It’s currently nearly impossible to counterfeit. When the UK introduced chip and pin cards to the market, it enjoyed a 70% reduction in counterfeiting over a decade. This is not necessarily the most powerful benefit of a mobile credit card reader. EMV readers are packed with software and hardware that enhance the way you do business. If you’re a small merchant, this technology is budget-friendly enough to bring your business into the new era. If you have a travelling company, your point of sale easily moves with you. SumUp also comes with a range of applications that lift weight off your bookkeeper’s and even marketer’s shoulders. \n\nYour credit card reader can keep track of your stock, feed figures into Excel spreadsheets, and automate your cash ups until they’re ready to be processed by your accountant. Once your data is in Excel, you gain the benefit of Microsoft’s analytics sites. This way, you can not only find out which staff are pushing the most profits, but also what stock is performing best for your company. Power Query streams your data into the cloud so that it’s available to all branches of your company. Power Pivot crunches your data into usable models. You can even discover the geographical areas that are serving your business best. There is a reason the data revolution is still buzzing with energy: it drives revenue exceptionally well, and you needn’t be loyal to only one operating system. SumUp is a credit card reader for iPhone and Android. The Air card reader connects via Bluetooth to Samsung Android and iPad, too. \n\n## The Payment Race\nPoint of sale systems may seem like one of the most pointless parts of your business to strategize, but the reality is not so forgiving. Since the personal computer became a part of retail store point of sale systems in 1983, sales have been rising and expenses, decreasing. A well-deployed <a href=\"http://www.dionco.com/public/articles/POS_Study_White_Paper.pdf\">POS typically lifts sales by 20%</a> and reduces expenses by 15% within six months. Profit margins rise by 25% and net profits increase by 30%. Your mobile credit card reader can even reduce your staff compliment. The causes of these effects are wide ranging. \n\n- Cash register time is reduced, shortening queues at peak hours.\n- Card purchases are processed faster.\n- Software with easy-to-use prompts reduces margins of error.\n- Stock control is easier to achieve. Low stock levels are instantly recognizable.\n- Payroll information is automatically recorded to reduce the need for clerical staff.\n- Delivery and mobile versions of your business can be deployed to stretch your reach and thus your profits.\n- Budgeting and inventory needs are made available without complex data entry.\n- Better inventory control translates directly into fewer lost sales.\n![credit card readers the payment race chart](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/47zgjkHqLK0MCaq6cCQwkM/19005d64d31e2af918104afce7fa52b1/credit-card-readers-race-chart.png)\nThese days, your point of sale can become whatever you want it to be. The era of monetized software is slowly coming to an end as freeware becomes widely available. This gives you all the functionality you could hope for from a portable credit card reader without any extra expense. If you want powerful automation and analytics, you can have it with only a minor change in your hardware. A reader with an app that sends data straight to Excel puts a huge collection of freeware at your fingertips. Profit chasing has never been simpler. \n\n## POS Through the Centuries\nThe first POS system was designed in the 1800s to give saloon owners a way to prevent staff theft. The first cash register was merely designed to store money away from greedy hands, but in the 1970s, the fast food industry began to revolutionize payment strategies. POS evolved into a way to make staff more productive, record orders, and accept cash. When personal computing emerged, restaurants developed touch screen POS systems. The retail industry followed with the development of the first POS hardware for general use, thereby introducing an array of brand new needs to point of sale software: inventory management, data analytics, and the management of cash by employees. Security threats evolved with the criminals spearheading the shift, and card readers began their own revolution. The United States is behind much of the world in terms of banking. Even some third world countries have speedier card processing capacities and more secure systems than the United States. As the nation migrates, so will its readers. The first stage of the transition to EMV has focused on authentication that doesn’t require a dial-out authorization. As merchants adopt chip readers, speeds will improve. Currently, the US’ version of EMV behaves differently to Europe’s, processing at a speed of 4.4 – 11 seconds. EMV cards will eventually be processed within a fraction of a second, just as they do offshore.\n\n## A Mobile Credit Card Reader with Many Talents\nAn Android or iPad credit card reader can be used to cut IT exponentially. Before a credit card reader could be used to control your point of sale, retailers frequently spent thousands of dollars on their systems that inevitably needed to be upgraded within a few years. Today’s wireless credit card reader can be programmed to perform all POS functions, even if you have multiple staff members operating their own credit card reader. Your employees’ personal mobile devices can be used as hubs because SumUp is as much a credit card reader for Android as it is a reader for iOS. Since almost 70% of U.S. consumers already have EMV chip cards, migration is no longer a matter of choice. In choosing a contactless reader, you’re choosing a partner who will develop with a rapidly growing industry. SumUp intends to expand its technology to cover all POS requirements, but for now, cash payments can be monitored through your terminal. Receipts can be provided regardless of the payment type used. \n![credit card reader for iphone or android or ipad](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/49tqb0orv2sMWW8AM0kqaa/79a8d0f6c91f298317ebc98e3b0b0b76/credit-card-reader-iphone-android.png)\n## Protecting Your Buyers\nUsing a contactless reader that doesn’t protect customer data is risky. In an age of identity theft and in a country as litigious as the United States, only the highest data security standards will do. If your terminal doesn’t transfer data using PCI-DSS, your clients’ information is exposed. Similarly, secure sockets layer and transport layer security are needed to encrypt card data at the highest level. Global privacy standards should also be in play. A focus on identity theft has become critical with the adoption of EMV technology. Counterfeiting has been taken off the table, so criminals have been opening new cards under consumers’ contact details instead. SumUp is one of the few readers with 256-bit encryption that sets in as soon as the card is dipped, so that data can’t be monetized through fraud. \n\nEMV transactions are put through several separate computations. The card is authenticated, fraud is detected, risk is assessed, and signature verification is performed. There is a fair amount of flexibility here, though, so not all readers are created equal. Cryptography is an optional extra, and one your clients will expect as part of your service to them. It’s only reasonable that merchants do all they can to secure their buyers’ information. \n\nEMV is changing the payment ecosystem drastically. Starbucks experienced almost 5 million mobile payments a week in 2014, and it’s EMV technology that’s laying down the infrastructure needed to support this kind of payment. Preparing with a gold-standard reader is laying the foundation for change ahead of what will be a complex and expensive transition in the years to come. As with all forms of business strategy, choosing an option that scales to your growing company and the dynamic nature of the marketplace is the most intelligent and economical solution you can choose. \n\n","fullWidthImage":{"id":"6snxwGIA7Y4cIUeSKM44q6","updatedAt":"2017-06-26T10:59:48.484Z","title":"sumup credit card reader and smartphone","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/6snxwGIA7Y4cIUeSKM44q6/93f38ae1c8e28f8d4df568a4792ffffa/sumup-credit-card-reader.jpg","details":{"size":107321,"image":{"width":1920,"height":932}},"fileName":"sumup-credit-card-reader.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"secondaryContent":"## SumUp offers you the best solution in card payments\nWith SumUp, you can quickly and easily accept credit and debit card payments with your smartphone or tablet.\n\n<div class=\"btns btns--seo\">\n  <a href=\"https://sumup.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=credit-card-reader\" class=\"btn btn--cta\">\n  Learn more about SumUp!\n  </a>\n</div>","seoLinks":"### Popular articles  \n\n- [Credit Card Processing Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow](https://sumup.com/credit-card-processing?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=credit-card-reader) - How to increase your small business revenue?

It should actively contribute to your marketing and stock control systems. It should also optimize your employees’ time so that they can put their focus where it belongs: on upselling. Once you’ve hammered together an effective POS strategy, analytics should be gathered to enhance the many diverse tasks your point of sale can now fulfil. Your EMV terminal should be sophisticated enough to contribute to every single department in your company. \n\n## Where is Point of Sale Today?\nIn the Nineties, all you needed to run an efficient point of sale (POS) was a basic magnetic strip payment terminal, a computer, and software. Despite how rudimentary POS systems were 20 years ago, a basic interface often used to cost tens of thousands of dollars. Today, that price has been dragged down drastically by open source code and freeware applications you can nip and tuck to fit your precise needs. The days of paying massive flat fees for an EMV terminal are as good as over. Readers like SumUp charge a negligible percentage of each sale with no additional costs for your bookkeeper to worry about. SumUp doesn’t even have an upfront cost. \n\nOne of the most dramatic improvements to contemporary POS systems is the existence of analytics and automation. You can effectively use the data your cashiers enter when processing a sale to inform your marketing team, refine your stock choices, and obliterate much of your accountant’s legwork. You needn’t know the difference between a one and a zero to use such innovative functionality. With a click or two, analytics software will automatically craft your data into digestible graphs and other formats, ready for your management teams to analyse. Your SumUp wireless credit card terminal can feed information into Microsoft Excel, automating much of the work your accountant usually has to do at snail pace. By taking labor intensive tasks off your staff’s shoulders, you can at last use their most profitable talents to raise revenue. \n\n## The Mobile Solution\nA credit card terminal with EMV processing power can travel anywhere a smartphone can. Every waiter in your restaurant can carry their own pocket-sized terminal, speeding up service and keeping your guests smiling. Your reader travels with your delivery people, who can use any Android or iOS device to process transactions the contactless way. Mobile businesses never need to worry about processing payments before service delivery again. \n![mobile credit card terminal how it works scheme](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/1MgT8nfA2EmSm8EakO4sU4/6f23502373f160de9833d04ef3b81411/mobile-credit-card-terminal-scheme.png)\nA recent study of businesses deploying new POS systems found that entrepreneurs had four primary reasons for upgrading: \n\n- 48% upgraded to cut out time-consuming point of sale tasks.\n- 33% wanted to shorten queues and serve clients faster.\n- 20% wanted to gain competitive advantage.\n- 12% wanted to improve customer loyalty through better service and loyalty programs.\n\n## The Customer-Centric Credit Card Terminal\nNearly half of all retailers believe that their POS systems eat up too much of their employees’ time. Failure to update to more efficient and accurate EMV technology has even worse effects than that, though. Price inaccuracy can directly drain your profits, and screen and keyboard malfunctions can cost you time and money. The inability to accept credit and debit cards has an obvious impact on your bottom line, while a lack of loyalty programs skims from your revenue indirectly, especially if your direct competitors are offering rewards. Implementing a new system that eliminates all these problems is easier and more economical than you might imagine, and it begins with your wireless credit card terminal. \n\n## Step One: Adding Card Terminal EMV Technology\nWith a little thought and effort, your credit card terminal can act as the foundation of your POS. While your SumUp reader only processes EMV cards, you can still run cash sales through it and, in so doing, replace your register entirely. How you build your next POS step depends on which operating system you use. \n![credit card terminals symbols](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/TL2VEtDEEmcG2cg6WEGKU/0cbfcaab5252e502d15504b3b1dd278e/credit-card-terminals.png)\n## Step Two: Adding a Point of Sale System for Microsoft and Android\n\nIf you’re a Microsoft client, an Excel point of sale application is easy and economical to implement because SumUp can convert all the data it receives into XLS format. Apps can even be installed on all your staff’s touchscreen devices, so it’s one of the most seamless ways to upgrade to EMV chip cards. In a single download, and often at no outlay, you can issue barcode sales bills, control your stock, complete end of month stock balances, and handle purchases. \n\nSumUp also graduates your POS to the cloud when you add web-based analytics software to your spreadsheets. Excel itself has an online version capable of churning up your sales statistics, but more evolved applications are worth considering. Advanced analytics apps can: \n\n- Track average inventory and shrinkage.\n- Assess your gross margin and sell-through percentages.\n- Calculate return on investment.\n- Calculate your average basket value.\n- Tell you who your most profitable employees are.\n\nWith that data, you can make more intelligent inventory choices and assess your buyers’ responses to your marketing efforts. Your store performance data gives you all you need to know about each branch of your business, while your employee figures can be used to inform a better talent management strategy. \n\n## Step Two: for iOS\nIf you or your any of your staff are Apple users, SumUp’s iTunes app emails or texts receipts to your client, accepts all credit cards, and transfers payments to your bank account. SumUp is the first to launch an open mPOS platform with native software development kits and application programming interfaces. Anti-fraud measures are built into the reader, adding an extra tier of security to the already airtight safety of EMV technology. Your iOS users can use browser-based applications, too, which means you can be entirely independent of all operating systems if you prefer to be. In essence, what all this jargon means is that your credit card reader has been opened up to third parties, so you can develop your own applications or download those created by others. \n\n## Step Three: Stock Control\n\nBy feeding product codes into your payment terminal, your inventory numbers can be updated automatically with every transaction. This lets you identify which items are selling well, which need replacement, and which are responding to your marketing efforts. \n\n## Step Four: Stay Secure and Integrate\n\nSumUp’s Checkout API lets you integrate stand-alone and omnichannel payments online and off so that card information never makes it to your server. All information is encrypted, and a new transaction is generated for each payment to prevent fraud. If you don’t want to embed your own web app, SumUp provides a custom checkout program. \n\n## Step Five: Use Your POS Register for Your Books\n\nWith the help of additional applications, SumUp’s POS can act as a pixelated version of your brick and mortar cash register, managing everything from multiple payment methods to discounts and reporting. It can: \n\n- Function in the cloud\n- Operate in offline mode.\n- Manage loyalty programs.\n- Handle a full suite of transactions over the phone or via tokenization.\n- Accept data about your clients.\n\nThe API also creates a pagination of transaction events so that you can control refunds, chargebacks, and orders. This data is easily transferred into your bookkeeping software to cut out the need for repetitive tasks. Transaction histories can be churned into metrics to inform your marketing and advertising teams. \n![new business model with emv credit card terminal](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/1MJjxDB9H6SEYAmeU2KUSc/801b70f3995384f3bd078745b98f3052/new-business-model-emv-terminal.png)\n## Creating a New Business Model with Your Credit Card Terminal\n\nToday’s POS systems are supposed to enhance your revenue and make life easier for staff, and your EMV terminalcan act as the central point around which the rest of your POS functions revolve. Before the new generation of contactless EMV readers hit the stands, how you accepted payments limited the mobility of your business. Fees were too steep to support more than a few card machines, and mobile credit card processing wasn’t an option. Today, your terminal can travel with you, so your business isn’t limited to your brick and mortar address. If you want to sell products at a convention, you no longer need a hard line. Contactless readers will carry you from outdoor markets to catered events without requiring you to prepare. If you’ve never thought about what your business model would look like if it was unconstrained to a physical address, it’s time to start. \n\nEMV technology is more than merely a tool for eliminating fraud. With a little thought, it will change the way you think about your company. If you’ve been in business for a decade, you’ve probably invested thousands in old fashioned POS systems. It’s time to wave goodbye to those unnecessary costs and say “hello” to tools that raise profits.

Cash abdicated its kingly throne years ago, and digital payment technologies are evolving at a full throttle.\n\nGlobal payment services are remarkably convenient for shoppers, and falling behind on electronic payment technology can cost a business a significant chunk of its profits. Affluent and low-wage shoppers need to be served equally well, and an EMV credit card reader achieves precisely that.\n\nIts ground-level processing fees and transport-friendly design makes it a practical solution regardless of your profit margins and the mobile nature of certain business models. The mobile boom means that almost <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US41725415\" target=\"_blank\">two billion new devices</a> were shipped in 2016 alone, and the business world needs to catch up. \n\n## Contemporary EMV Reader Technology\nWith devices becoming economical to manufacture and use, “good enough” is no longer good enough — your terminal should compete against the most sophisticated emerging technology available. __It’s now possible for even the smallest companies to carry pinnacle devices without breaking a sweat over their expenses.__\n\nChip technology relates to the computer chip on Europay, Mastercard, and Visa cards. It was deployed to lend security to shoppers and vendors alike. It protects against fraud by cutting back on replication and counterfeiting. Chip data also prevents criminals from getting away with transaction number theft.\n\nChip cards can be processed the old way: through traditional, hard-wired swipe machines, which are sluggish, heavy, and immobile. In contrast, a SumUp EMV card reader fits into the pocket, is feather-light, and can be taken wherever there’s a mobile phone signal.\n\n![emv card reader with wifi and bluetooth technology](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/2mG8aJpuaIIqA6AYie8qQI/0e173022d9faad32cd4597bee53964c2/emv-card-reader-wifi-bluetooth.png)\n\nSumUp’s card terminal uses Bluetooth technology to connect to its app on your mobile phone. Your client can choose whether to swipe, use a chip, or pay with their phone, and you receive their payment within a day or two.\n\nThe Air Card Reader makes use of your mobile phone’s buttons, which makes it even lighter than its UK predecessor. It’s compatible with Android and iOS and lets you straddle the shift to EMV chip technology without adding unnecessary expenses.\n\nA mobile EMV terminal needs reinforced hardware if it's to travel successfully, so SumUp Air is made with only first-class components, insured by a year’s warranty. It prepares you for the mobile payment revolution, which could dominate the market in as early as 2018.\n\nIn 2016, the mobile payment users rose to 37%, a number that’s expected to increase to 50% in 2017 and <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Payments-Will-Triple-US-2016/1013147\" target=\"_blank\">69% in 2019</a>. The only economical way to manage the exodus is by preparing while the chip shift is still occurring.\n\n## Stop Paying the Earth\nTraditional swipe terminals are expensive, generally adding a massive batch of fees related to everything from startup costs and termination to invoicing. A low-cost swipe machine could cost you between 3% and 4% per transaction, whereas a premium EMV card reader cuts away fixed fees entirely.\n\n__SumUp, the best in its class on U.S. soil, also comes without paperwork and termination fees.__ At 2.75% of every transaction, it’s among the most economical terminals in its class, with no monthly costs or delivery fees. The app and reporting tools are free too.\n\nSupport is provided via telephone and email at no extra cost to you. What’s more, if you’re feeling unsure about the migration to EMV, your EMV terminal is neatly wrapped up in a 30-day money-back guarantee. \n\n![emv terminal and analytics](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/5ZNfIJ1vd6iEacASUymYkq/12f9a66cbee32340f3246cfc835d959c/emv-terminal-analytics.png)\n\n## Your Analytics, Your Way\nIn today’s data-dominated society, no business can remain at its competitive peak without analytics to help it adjust. An EMV card reader is your ticket to the profitable world of small data. This gives your marketers and bookkeepers a wealth of information to process to keep your company ahead of the herd.\n\nYour payouts are automated, glitches are rare, and the application evolves with the SumUp team, who regularly improves stability and device compatibility. EMV credit card terminals can be updated without hardware changes, which keeps you up to date with changing consumer behavior. \n\n## The Liability Shift\n\nThe EMV card reader has taken the U.S. by storm. It’s the technical standard for an excellent reason: The liability shift now holds retailers accountable for all credit card fraud that happens in their establishments so nobody can afford to lag behind. The shift was made in 2015, but other countries around the world have already migrated. For nations like Australia and Canada, the EMV chip revolution has proved to be highly effective at preventing fraud.\n\nIn the U.S., compliance is the best way to avoid liability costs. \n\nWhen you accept credit cards, each card insertion generates a one-time code, which is then used to approve payment. This means the only way to process a card is by inserting it, effectively eliminating fraud.\n\nAs it stands, two-thirds of in-store fraud involves counterfeiting, making EMV credit card terminals the best way to manage risk. U.S. retailers have struggled to get their providers to offer chip processing capabilities. \n\n![credit cards liability shift with emv technology](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/29rvMJj2NGgawY6SQyQK8C/09a798274815546dfeb27a26ba38b287/credit-cards-liability-shift-emv.png)\n\nExisting point of sale (PoS) providers have been resistant to the chip shift due to their confusion about charges. Vendors can’t afford to lose their place in the race any longer, and an excellent (PoS) provider who develops its technology with the market instead of behind it is a much-needed asset.\n\nSumUp is such a provider, so when you migrate, you’re not merely buying an EMV card reader. __You’re investing in a long-term business relationship that gives you the competitive edge while your consumers evolve. __\n\n## Keeping Your Lines Moving\nSome chip terminals are still absurdly lethargic. Given that this technology has existed for two decades, this is a symptom of poor company management and not of EMV's capabilities.\n\nIf your terminal is causing a lag in lines and slowing down your deliveries, you own a veritable fossil-of-a-reader, and your provider is failing you. __An adequate EMV terminal should process payments faster than your tellers can handle cash.__\n\nMasterCard’s Chiro Aikat said, of chip technology, “this is the biggest thing that has happened in terms of consumer experience since the past 25 to 30 years.” It's thus supposed to make your point of sale simpler and quicker, and your clients should be delighted by your service.\n\n## Air: The Wave of the Future\n\nSumUp’s new EMV reader is a meager 7cm x 7cm, with a width of 2.5 cm. It lets you pre-save items for better stock control and makes your sale history available through its application.\n\nIt supports some wireless printers and can plug into devices that aren’t Bluetooth-enabled. Near Field Communication is also supported. This wireless technology exchanges data between devices as long as they’re held close together. \n\nSumUp has performed exceptionally well on major review sites, both regarding its app and the hardware itself. Its pricing model is transparent, and merchants are free to cancel the service at any point.\n\nThe company also holds a portion of payments in a reserve account as a fraud prevention strategy when necessary, which gives businesses a solid foundation for their security policies. \n\n## Cards Accepted\n\nExpect to have your card reader up and running in a matter of minutes. It supports an array of debit and credit cards and is certified by regulators including: \n\n- American Express ExpressPay\n- MasterCard PayPass\n- Visa ADTV and Ready\n- MasterCard TQM and TIP\n\n![accepted debit and credit cards](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/3Jhuv7kHjG60MYkAosIEQM/1871e9a9084e11d84c02fc6aae965b8e/debit-and-credit-cards.png)\n\n## How it Works\n\nDuring a migration to EMV, the market tends to become somewhat fuzzy because client uncertainty reigns. The U.S. transition is happening slowly, so to weather the shift, you need an EMV credit card reader that tells your buyers whether to use a chip or magnetic strip.\n\nEach card and transaction can vary, but ultimately, all chip transactions will entail the insertion of the chip.\n\n## Full Speed Ahead\n\nEven some third world countries have migrated to chip technology and mobile payments. The USA is well behind the rest of the world when it comes to banking, but this has its benefits:\n\nNo U.S. merchant needs to adopt new PoS technology as though it’s The Great Unknown. There is a wealth of experience to refer to in countries such as Switzerland and the UK, who have already adopted the EMV reader as an industry standard. The switch to chip has entailed so few glitches that Sweden’s cash transactions accounted for a mere 20% of all retail sales in 2015.\n\nEmerging markets are starting to ban large notes, which means cash-oriented markets will soon be extinct. \n\nIn this day and age, in which rivalry is extreme and the evolution of competitive edge happens in a flash, it’s become increasingly important to prepare and adopt new technology ahead of your industry.\n\nSumUp is more than a mere terminal: it’s a payment partner, and one who has proved its mettle through constant, reliable innovation.\n\n---\n\n## In Summary:\n__The shift to EMV is inevitable. As modern merchants, we must embrace the EMV reader technology for our customers, our security and our competitive purposes. SumUp offers not only a card reader, but a full-blown service to satisfy all your payment needs, making it one of the best readers on offer.__\n","fullWidthImage":{"id":"6snxwGIA7Y4cIUeSKM44q6","updatedAt":"2017-06-26T10:59:48.484Z","title":"sumup credit card reader and smartphone","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/6snxwGIA7Y4cIUeSKM44q6/93f38ae1c8e28f8d4df568a4792ffffa/sumup-credit-card-reader.jpg","details":{"size":107321,"image":{"width":1920,"height":932}},"fileName":"sumup-credit-card-reader.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"secondaryContent":"## SumUp offers you the best solution in card payments\nWith SumUp, you can quickly and easily accept credit and debit card payments with your smartphone or tablet.\n\n<div class=\"btns btns--seo\">\n  <a href=\"https://sumup.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=emv-card-reader\" class=\"btn btn--cta\">\n  Learn more about SumUp!\n  </a>\n</div>","seoLinks":"### Popular articles\n\n- [The Credit Card Reader That Fits In Your Pocket and Suits Your Pocket](https://sumup.com/credit-card-reader?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=emv-card-reader) - Expand your knowledge about mobile credit card readers and increase your competitive edge by staring  to accept credit card paymnets on your iPhone, iPad or Android device.

The vast majority of that fraud happened within United States borders. 47% of cross-border fraud happened from the U.S. too, and experts blame it on America’s slow adoption of EMV chip cards. When the UK deployed credit card chip technology, their counterfeit fraud rates declined by 70%. Now that the U.S. has, at last, made the transition, those statistics will topple locally, too.\n\n## What is EMV?\nEMV stands for Europay, MasterCard, and Visa, the credit card behemoths who dominate the sector and developed the global standard for chip-based security. EMV has come to represent every credit card with chip, even those issued by smaller companies. Because the chips generate a new number for every transaction, they make counterfeiting almost impossible. The card is inserted into instead of swiped through a reader, and a signature completes the purchase.\n\n![picture of credit cards with emv chip installed](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/6ta3GQqvcc6CYQ8gO8uGIK/7fd7073db255f2628d16df13a4d2973a/emv-chip-credit-cards-picture.png)\n\n## Who Pays for Fraud?\nThe transition to EMV chip cards is good news if you have the technology to process them, but dire news if you’re still dragging your heels. Two years ago, retailers didn’t have to cover the counterfeit security breach tab, but now you do. The only insurance against liability is to offer your clients EMV technology.\n\nThe liability shift began late in 2015 to encourage retailers to adopt safer practices. At the time, the retail community complained bitterly to the National Retail Federation about the expense of upgrading to new card readers, but you needn’t pay a cent in upfront or fixed costs. Your typical EMV reader costs between $500 and $1000, alongside monthly and transaction fees. In comparison, SumUp EMV readers only charge a percentage of each transaction. They don’t demand upfront or monthly fees, so security during the liability shift is easily won.\n\n## How Does EMV Affect My Point of Sale\n\nThe biggest complaint thus far about EMV chip technology is that it processes cards at snail’s pace. When the transition was still happening, transactions were painfully certainly slow, as was buyer adoption. Now that 2017 has arrived, chip credit cards are faster than magnetic strips were.\n\n## How Does EMV Add Security?\n![symbol of emv chip security](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/6HYP35nwJOog2yOI2ceiMU/026cd1a503bf0523c8b9d137eb77cf8a/emv-security-symbol.png)\n\n### The EMV transaction flow has 10 steps.\n\n1. The terminal and card chip make an application choice.\n2. The terminal reads data from that application.\n3. Data is authenticated offline to make sure the card is not a counterfeit.\n4. Confirmation of the transaction and chip occur.\n5. Cardholder verification is done with a PIN, signature, or CVM.\n6. The reader checks floor limits and the like.\n7. The terminal requests approval.\n8. The card approves online or off.\n9. An online authorization request and authentication are completed and sent to the payment authorizer.\n10. The transaction is finalized and an issuing script is sent back to the card.\n\nIt’s been in use around the world since 2011 and is well tested through an estimated 19 million terminals. In addition to the extra steps involved in transactions, the signature authentication process is more accurate. PIN verification adds yet another fraud prevention layer. Identity theft becomes far more of a challenge with an EMV chip, too, since all the sensitive information magnetic strips freely gave away to criminals is secured. It’s important to note that EMV is not a new technology.\n\n## What Do Buyers Want?\nEMV chips are not merely a virtual Fort Knox for information, but a core customer service, too. They keep your buyers safe from breaches. In fact, the more aware the marketplace becomes of credit card chip benefits, the more it perceives the failure to adopt this technology as a customer service failing. The press has bombarded consumers with enough information to write tomes about the new standard. In 2014, 60% of buyers welcomed EMV, a number that grows with every passing day. Even so, EMV chip cards alone are not enough: the data your reader accesses needs to be encrypted, something that the vast majority of readers don’t do. Your defence of your clients’ privacy is only as powerful as your end-to-end encryption, which should be certified by EMVCo.\n\n## End to End What?\nEnd-to-end encryption is a system that limits communication to the users who are interacting. It defeats attempts to access the data on any software or credit card with chip by keeping that information indecipherable while it travels. This kind of encryption was once the terrain of programmers and IT geeks alone, but now you’ll hear laypeople discussing it over their afternoon tea. It’s become a part of everyday life given the sheer breadth of data theft worldwide. WhatsApp users are kept informed of it with every upgrade, and some basic journaling applications offer it. If something as benign as a blog offers encryption, how much more important is it when dealing with credit card data?\n\n## The History of Encryption\nThe internet passes information through a long string of routers, servers, and devices. At any stage, a hacker with a penchant for credit card fraud can intercept that data, so encryption was developed as a cure-all. The data on your chip is scrambled before it travels beyond your reader. When it reaches the correct recipient, it’s unscrambled. This is not a new tool. The Ancient Greeks used an encryption and authentication technique to protect Spartan military communication, and in 1500 BC, Assyrian merchants used it to protect their trade transactions. You don’t need to understand the jargon or participate in the encryption process to benefit from it. You only need to choose the right transaction partner. SumUp uses secure socket layer security because it’s the web’s encryption standard. Every EMV credit card can use the encryption as long as your reader can. There are no manual inputs or tasks involved on the retailer’s side. The magic happens automatically.\n\n## What About Card-Not-Present Fraud?\nThe EMV credit card transition has been 99.9% effective at preventing card present fraud in Europe. As adoption matures, the United States will probably see a rise in both magnetic strip and card-not-present fraud. This will upset the current balance, leading to more losses for retailers who are still relying on magnetic strips. Credit card chip and pin technology is thus your best protective measure for on and offline card processing, but your e-commerce business needs further mechanisms to keep data safe.\n\n![evolution and history of emv chip cards](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/56jBGra0CkiQs8qScKoKUu/dc0891ee432af5c71fbf4fb68b6cec4a/evolution-emv-chip-cards.png)\n## The Evolution of EMV Chip Adoption\nThe first EMV chip card was issued in 2010 to give valued clientele an extra tier of security and create a globally accepted card. A year later, another 1.6 million users were given chip and PIN debit cards. When smaller issuers like JPMorgan Chase and U.S. Bancorp migrated to EMV, the momentum became unstoppable. However, the UK adopted chip and sign cards more widely long before the U.S. did. They wanted to introduce technology that could process transactions online and off, an ability that is still as relevant today as it was all those years ago. Offline endorsements involve the use of a signature, while online ones involve the use of PINs. Today’s credit card security happens in layers, with each new stratum adding an extra amount of security. If hackers get past the outer layer, they still have several more to pass through if they’re to reach the sensitive data in the center.\n\nThe UK’s EMV peak happened in 2008 when there was a 40% reduction in general fraud rates. These numbers rose to over 69% for face-to-face transactions. France experienced even more startling results. Their fraud rates on domestic face-to-face transactions stood at a mere [0.01% in 2009](https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/documents/rprf/rprf_pubs/120111wp.pdf).\n\n## What Else Can EMV Do?\nCredit card chip readers come with enough bells and whistles to be attractive to any retailer. They speed up your queues, simplify your point of sale, and even create records of your stock levels and bookkeeping data. Contactless terminals are also far more compact than their predecessors, so they can be carried from door to door in the pocket. Your business can thus be as mobile as you wish. All your reader needs is a mobile Android or iOS device to support transactions.\n\nEMV might have been developed to keep retailers and buyers safe, but it’s evolved to give small and medium-sized businesses access to business models that weren’t available to them before. You can now carry your point of sale anywhere and gain a new level of automation to support your human resources and accounting departments. Your data capture and processing workload have withered away into nothing, leaving your staff with extra hours to work on your revenue. With the right EMV partner, chip cards are your ticket to a profit boom.\n","fullWidthImage":{"id":"6snxwGIA7Y4cIUeSKM44q6","updatedAt":"2017-06-26T10:59:48.484Z","title":"sumup credit card reader and smartphone","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/6snxwGIA7Y4cIUeSKM44q6/93f38ae1c8e28f8d4df568a4792ffffa/sumup-credit-card-reader.jpg","details":{"size":107321,"image":{"width":1920,"height":932}},"fileName":"sumup-credit-card-reader.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"secondaryContent":"## SumUp offers you the best solution in card payments\nWith SumUp, you can quickly and easily accept credit and debit card payments with your smartphone or tablet.\n\n<div class=\"btns btns--seo\">\n  <a href=\"https://sumup.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=emv-credit-card-chip\" class=\"btn btn--cta\">\n  Learn more about SumUp!\n  </a>\n</div>","seoLinks":"### Popular articles\n\n- [Accept Credit Cards the Secure, Speedy Way](https://sumup.com/accept-credit-cards?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=emv-credit-card-chip) - Learn more how to accept credit card payments on your iPhone or Android smartphone ✔ Support your company's growth with fast and secure card reader ready for liability shift EMV standard.\n\n- [A Credit Card Machine with Built In Ambition](https://sumup.com/credit-card-machine?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=emv-credit-card-chip) - Do you know that you can start accepting all credit card payments within few days without contract and hidden fees?

Readers like SumUp are small enough to fit into your back pocket and as mobile as the smartphone used to help process payments. This means waitrons can carry their own readers, delivery people can process cards at clients’ doors, and on-site traders can control as many points of sale as they choose. The result is faster, superior service at a cheaper price. \n![accept credit cards](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/1ocN38lTqEgU6SuyOCiE4y/67e38d29b6e75646749f5280e00b3aea/accept-credit-cards.png)\nYour clients deserve only the safest, quickest payment methods, so only state of the art technology will do. Your point of sale system affects your bottom line in several ways, from limiting your expenses to raising your revenue. Don't let this critical part of your business fall between the cracks. \n\n## The Benefits of EMV Chips\nEMV chips come with significant benefits, not least of which is the size, economy, and portability of the latest machines. If you want to enhance your point of sale and cash ups, EMV readers will push you into a new era of ease and automation. Visa and MasterCard predicted that all U.S. retailers would be EMV compliant by the end of 2015. The reality is not quite as clear-cut. <a href=\"http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/emv-chip-cards-arrive-poll.php\">Seventy percent</a> of consumers had EMV cards in April 2016, yet nationwide, <a href=\"https://nrf.com/news/us-transition-emv-chip-cards-trudging-along\">only 20%</a> of transactions leveraged the security of this technology. Effectively, consumers are rearing to move ahead, but merchants are lagging behind. \n![benefits of emv chips acceptance](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/zSl4L3UuxUmoySW8giiq/2aa9ceb8a46ebfcbbb5622b1ad6d9e10/benefits-of-emv-chips-accepting.png)\nChip technology has been a contentious issue in the United States, largely on the back of misunderstandings about its benefits and features. EMV card processing is no longer as sluggish as many merchants believe. In fact, today’s machines can process a payment within seconds. Chips have even had a success rate of almost 100% at reducing credit card fraud, and now, with card readers as light and economical as SumUp, they can change the way retailers do business. \n\n## How It Works\nEMV stands for Europay, Mastercard, and Visa, the three most popular chip cards. Client data is kept on a computer chip that will soon replace magnetic strip technology entirely. In the past, hackers could gain access to credit card information all too easily, but chip technology is quickly eradicating this form of theft. \n\nA standard credit card machine is expensive, packing fee upon fee without offering any significant security benefits. Chip processing time is steadily being cut, too. In September 2016, the general speed of an EMV reader was already at 4.2 seconds. \n\n## The Liability Shift\nRetailers are falling behind with their chip card payments at enormous risk. The U.S. liability shift is already in full swing, effectively ending the budget-friendliness of magnetic strip payments. With responsibility for fraud chargebacks having shifted onto retailers’ shoulders should they not have an EMV reader, your lack of chip technology could cost you dearly. \n![take credit card payments after liability shift emv chip](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/IK4tyQKEQS0wEwCuaISU4/55b8b75c7bcd67c69a56d7f06f68f862/take-credit-card-payments-liability-shift-emv.png)\nMaestro, Visa, MasterCard, and American Express have already finished the general retailing shift. In October 2017, the final stage will be completed when credit card companies shift liability at pay-at-pump gas stations. Nine out of 10 U.S. consumers say they’ve tried to pay a merchant who wasn’t EMV compliant in the last six months. The ability to accept credit cards payments that are EMV-compliant is essentially an insurance policy against fraud and an impressively economical one at that: A contactless SumUp terminal comes with no cancellation or flat fees at a meagre price of 2.7% of each transaction. No intelligent insurer would sell a policy at such a rock bottom rate, and yet EMV “insurance” is available to every merchant in the country at precisely that price. \n\n## Why Chip Technology?\nEMV credit card payment systems have been introduced specifically to prevent criminals from creating clone cards, but they also protect consumers from identity theft. Not all readers that accept credit cards are created equal, though: some send unencrypted data over a network, which exposes the card to theft. This is why SumUp encrypts all data that’s put through the terminal. \n\n## EMV for Advanced Users\n\nSDK and API integration means your SumUp terminal can leverage merchant account resources in a customized way, too. API stands for “application program interface”, which lets you decide how your software interacts with other programs and apps. SDK stands for “software development kit”. This gives you the power to create your own applications to interact with your software, hardware, and operating system. \n\nCheckouts can be accessed online and via mobile, which means your point of sale is as ever-present as the internet is. Server communication with SumUp is possible, so if you have the expertize to create your own integrated checkout form, the option is available to you. If you prefer to manage it simply, a form is provided to use as-is or to customize. Don’t let SDK and API-integration intimidate you — SumUp will accept credit cards as soon as it’s connected to a device, no complicated coding or handlers needed. API and SDK are merely provided to serve merchants who prefer to take the reigns of their point of sale systems. \n\n## How it Works\nImplementing EMV couldn’t be easier. The card is “dipped” rather than swiped. The information on the chip is validated as legitimate while you're accepting your credit card payments, and, within a few seconds, the payment is processed. The money is then put into your account within the next 24 hours. Your cash ups are handled by the native application, and you can accept credit cards on iPhone and Android. The reader uses Bluetooth technology to connect to a mobile device carried by your employees and uses the phone or tablet’s keyboard when needed.\n\n## Seventies Technology\nMagnetic strip technology is antiquated. It was introduced to the market in the disco era, so it’s not surprising that data breaches are happening as a result. Trump Hotel is the most recent example, with a massive loss of consumer information in over six states late in 2015. Some firms have been hit twice in the same year, while others have fallen victim to a different kind of crime. Hackers gained access to Target and Home Depot systems through magnetic strip cards, leaving viruses on their cash registers. U.S. banks have changed their card payment systems for excellent reason: identity theft and credit card fraud are among the most serious cybercrime challenges facing America today. The solution is an easy one: accept credit cards with chips instead of using their magnetic strips. \n\n## Accounting\nWhen you take credit card payments, your machine gathers all the data your accountant needs to document your sales and stock movements. SumUp’s dashboard lets you export your sales data to an Excel file daily, weekly, or monthly. Receipts can also be emailed or attached to a compatible printer, but it’s the Excel export function that will give your business incredible power. Because Microsoft Office integrates with an array of free analytics tools, chip technology gives you tabulated data that your marketing and accounting departments once paid a fortune for. \n![accounting benefits accept credit cards payments](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/3rqYvQNS3YmeK24yWaMYKs/749fa44098febf0b97daae053ff48950/accounting-accept-credit-cards-payments.png)\nYour bookkeeping can now be finished in a quarter of the time, and your clients’ details are delivered to your desktop. Marketing data has never been easier to access. You can assess the buying habits of your clients, the quality of your leads, and how high your customer retention rates are. Adjust and hone your approach using your analytics as a guide, and your profits will rise. Accepting EMV credit card payments is your one-stop ticket to escalating revenue. \n\n## Reputation Matters\nWhen you choose how you’ll accept credit cards payments, you’re not making a basic one-off decision about a product. The business who takes care of your chip transactions will be an important partner for years to come. It’s critical to choose a brand that regularly updates its applications and hardware to suit evolving advancements and risks. Find a reader that has already proven its mettle in accepting credit card payments offshore, and look for outstanding merchant services ratings. Uptime should be as close to constant as possible, and support must, of course, be easily accesible. \n\n## Scalability\nThe way you accept credit cards payments must support your company’s growth. If you’re a small business, a reader designed for large-scale corporations that can afford extreme fees won’t serve you. If you’re a new, growing business, however, your reader must support you for at least the next five years. It must handle your stock control competently today and years from now. The only rational way to cope with this degree of scalability is by partnering with a brand that charges a percentage of your transactions without flat fees. \n\n## Your Business, Your Way\nIt’s tempting to get stuck in stasis when it comes to your business model if your point of sale is limited to your company premises. SumUp invites you to think outside the box. Now that your card payments are fully mobile, think about how you can leverage your new freedom. Will you add a mobile or e-commerce branch to your site? Will you franchise it or hire remote workers? The only limit is your imagination. Think big, and SumUp will grow to suit your ambitions.","fullWidthImage":{"id":"6snxwGIA7Y4cIUeSKM44q6","updatedAt":"2017-06-26T10:59:48.484Z","title":"sumup credit card reader and smartphone","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/6snxwGIA7Y4cIUeSKM44q6/93f38ae1c8e28f8d4df568a4792ffffa/sumup-credit-card-reader.jpg","details":{"size":107321,"image":{"width":1920,"height":932}},"fileName":"sumup-credit-card-reader.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"secondaryContent":"## SumUp offers you the best solution in card payments\nWith SumUp, you can quickly and easily accept credit and debit card payments with your smartphone or tablet.\n\n<div class=\"btns btns--seo\">\n  <a href=\"https://sumup.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=accept-credit-cards\" class=\"btn btn--cta\">\n  Learn more about SumUp!\n  </a>\n</div>","seoLinks":"### Popular articles\n\n- [A Credit Card Machine with Built In Ambition](https://sumup.com/credit-card-machine?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=accept-credit-cards) - Do you know that you can start accepting all credit card payments within few days without contract and hidden fees?

In fact, a processor with precisely those traits could even send your profits soaring if it has enough software compatibility to enhance your marketing and reduce your staffing needs. If that sounds too good to be true, you’ve not stumbled on SumUp, the credit card machine for small business that provides every Point of Sale (PoS) service a growing company needs to transform into a retail giant. \n\nCredit card processing can be approached without much thought if you’re a big business with an even bigger expense account to support your freedom. If you own a small or mobile business, you need to think a lot harder about your approach, but this doesn’t relegate you to a fee-heavy processor. Your PoS strategy is only restrictive if you have the wrong service provider.\n\nToday’s processors must, of course, be EMV-compliant, but new entrepreneurs need mobile credit card machines that do more than the bare minimum: There should be no revenue requirements to limit the scalability of your processing power and no list of processing fees longer than your business’ monthly general ledger. Choose a greedy processing firm and you’ll become weighed down by per-transaction verification fees, gateway and statement charges, and a percentage dollar charge on every sale. Fortunately, the power of choice has shifted away from banks to third party middlemen, so competitive terms have become a reality. You no longer need to spend more on your card processing than you do on your banking. \n\n## The Basics\nEMV stands for Europay, Mastercard, and Visa, but the term represents credit and debit cards that carry their own computer chips. All data is held on that chip, which is almost impossible to counterfeit. The U.S.A’s liability shift is in full swing, which means that if you don’t have the capacity to process EMV cards, you will be held financially responsible for any fraud attached to the payments you process. The risk is extreme but easy to avoid. Once you’ve moved beyond the old fashioned credit card swipe machine, you will also need to protect against identity theft. Surprisingly, this is not a feature most processors offer, but SumUp does. \n![card machine security standard](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/3y1P70vPw4KaGCmuuAqa4C/a9157fccb7260a0473f5704a7ca79c3b/card-machine-security.png)\n## Small Does Not Equal Incomprehensive\nIn the past, if you wanted 24/7 support, affordable fees, and absolute security, you had to pay a pretty penny. These days, highly competitive processors are offering staunch security at a negligible cost to you, along with extra features to sweeten the deal. \n\nWhat if your card machine had the power to restructure your PoS so that it kept your stock figures up to date, streamlined your cash ups, reduced the hours spent on bookkeeping, and gave your marketers valuable information about your buyers? What if your wireless credit card machine encrypted your customers’ data without tying your sales staff to a cash register? Points of sale just went mobile, so it’s time merchants raised their expectations. \n\n## Understanding Credit Card Machine Rates\nCost-benefit analysis of EMV technology can only weigh in favor of chip and sign processing considering the millions that are lost to fraud each year, but fee profiles are not all made equal. Debit rates for card processing average at 1.35%, but clients still need to pay their portion, which can be as much as 4%. Flagship services usually charge percentages of the sale on top of a flat fee of 19 to 30 cents per transaction. Monthly service fees and the like can raise your expenses considerably, but an inferior card machine comes with indirect costs as well: \n- Functionality that lacks intuitiveness can cost thousands in staff training.\n- Terminals sold at a flat rate can cost up to $1, 000 upfront.\n- Machines that process cards sluggishly can cost you profits from lost sales.\n- A payment system that doesn’t travel is less streamlined and efficient, obliterating your flexibility.\n- $8.6 billion was lost to credit and debit card fraud in 2014.\n- Shoddy systems store critical data on the device, making it vulnerable to theft.\n- Where support is not provided 24 hours a day, lost sales aren’t always easy to regain.\n![list of credit card machine rates](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/5sOaHaocPSWIa2uKcGoc4s/23f9daa835e543cba3e8b295346720fe/credit-card-machine-rates-list.png)\nWhen you’re looking at inferior processors, you’re unlikely to find a credit card machine for small business that is equally adept at running high volume and mobile payments. A fully scalable processor like SumUp is created specifically to suit a growing enterprise, so flexibility is built into every aspect of its design from processing technology to fee structures. With no flat fees, a low percentage of each transaction charged, extreme ease of use, and some of the best security features on the market today, SumUp keeps costs at ground zero, where they should be. That’s a cost-benefit analysis that any business owner can smile at. \n\n## Your Credit Card Machine, Your Way\nUntil recently, Paypal was among the only so-called card processors that travelled. Although it’s technically not a credit card processor, it was one of the rare ways small businesses could process card payments made from across the country or even the world. The industry has evolved, and now mobile credit card machines are stepping up to replace antiquated payment strategies. Away from the online marketplace, the only flexible alternative was once a customized system, which carried enough expenses to leave you shivering under your desk in terror. The solution isn’t as complex as you might think: a bespoke credit card machine for small business simply needs to charge a percentage of your sales so that your rates shrink and grow with your revenue. \n\nYour PoS is incomplete without software to support your bookkeeping, so SumUp lets you export your data to Excel, which is compatible with a number of accounting and marketing applications. Such a processor uproots your business, allowing your point of sale to travel to the other side of the shop floor and the other side of the world. A portable credit card machine can enhance your business model and even increase the size of your demographic. \n\n## Security Challenges\nYour credit card machine is no longer just a processor. It records your clients’ data, and that means you must live up to <a href=\"https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2011/04/DDP2015_United_States.pdf\">privacy regulations</a> unique to your industry. SumUp card reader protects businesses facing the following risks: \n- Medical institutions must live up to HIPAA privacy regulations that protect patient data. Not keeping to the policies will be considered a healthcare breach by The Department of Health.\n- As a financial services provider, you’re held to the standards of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n- Insurers are held to standards similar to those of HIPAA.\n- A violation of privacy laws can be enforced even in less regulated sectors.\n\nSince financial account numbers are considered sensitive data and thus more stringently governed, any merchant processing cards needs to comply with the law. Data protection is monitored by a number of different regulatory bodies, but it’s secured by one simple feature: end-to-end encryption. SumUp’s chip and sign machine encrypts data before transmitting it. It’s not rocket science, but it’s impressive nonetheless.\n\n## Myth Busting\nPeople resist change, regardless of how positive it is. The only serious complaint U.S. consumers have levied against EMV processing has to do with the speed of payments, but the truth is easy to swallow. Most chip and sign readers process cards in only a few seconds, so you can look forward to shorter queues and happier customers. As technology improves these speeds will vie against those of foreign countries which are processing cards in under a second. \n\nMerchants tend to think setting up their applications and readers requires the equivalent of a doctorate. Today’s best readers are like turnkey businesses: they operate the instant you begin to trade. Applications are intuitive to install, and fee structures are uncluttered. Employees don’t even need to be trained to keep your internal security measures intact because your reader will do that for you automatically. \n![credit card machine via bluetooth](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/2J21DmHdH28imcyICg0SMK/2388ec6127f3948c89b33fc29f0566af/credit-card-machine-bluetooth.png)\n## How it Works\nSumUp’s Air is as compact a reader as you’ll find. It communicates with mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets via Bluetooth. It uses your iOS or Android device’s keypad and travels well.

The U.S. only made the switch to EMV technology in 2015, and retailers are still unsure about how it affects them because it’s all buried in verbiage. \n\n## What is EMV?\nEMV stands for Europay, Mastercard, and Visa, although it represents all chip and sign cards. The only reason these particular international card behemoths are featured in the acronym is that they started the evolution of credit card payment and represent the global standard for enhanced security. EMV technology is simply chip-based credit cards that hold and transmit data to a reader during payment processing. The USA currently requires buyers to use both their chip and signature for card payments. \n![credit card payment with emv](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/4uuOf27kPe4IIgK4ayaGIU/814fa3eb95f65b20d76cfc2ac5857d49/credit-card-payment.png)\n## Why Was the USA Late to Adopt EMV?\nAlmost every country in the world has adopted EMV already. The USA has lagged behind because it distrusted the quality of chip-based security. Its reluctance was unfounded: Chip cards have almost eradicated brick and mortar credit card fraud. Globally, only two contactless models have emerged on a grand scale: EMV and magnetic strips. The difference between the two is a simple one: EMV chips create new transaction numbers with every payment, whereas magnetic strips only carry one. This makes counterfeiting possible, which is why EMV has had such a potent impact on overseas credit card fraud. Countries like France, Thailand, and Canada had embraced EMV before 2011, so this technology has enjoyed a long and successful trial overseas. \n\nEMV technology has created a central body that will work together to overcome any security issues that may emerge in the future. This collaboration will have outstanding payoffs for merchants, making it possible to solve problems faster and more thoroughly. \n\n## How Will Mobile Payments Be Affected by the Shift?\n\nEMV has introduced a generation of mobile contactless technologies, but as yet, only readers have evolved to full mobile saturation. The use of smartphones instead of credit cards is steadily growing, but whether this mode of payment will take over the market entirely remains to be seen. Mobile readers like SumUp make use of merchants’ phones to transmit information from card to network, usually through Bluetooth technology. The card market is fairly fragmented in that there are several different modes of processing and networks, a problem that EMV will solve. \n\n## What is Near Field Communication?\n\nNear field communication (NFC) is emerging alongside Bluetooth as a leading wireless technology for contactless card payments. It’s rudimentary in comparison to Bluetooth and far more sluggish, connecting within six seconds. Given that the industry now processes entire payments within three seconds, NFC cannot live up to buyer expectations. NFC can also communicate over only a four-centimeter distance in comparison to Bluetooth’s 30 feet. \n\n## What About Mobile Wallets?\n\nMobile wallets emerged as an option many years ago, but they’ve not kept up with the media’s optimistic projections. They attracted little interest from merchants and fell behind when EMVCo technology became possible. This new form of EMV will eventually place all your credit, debit, and insurance data on a single smartcard, which will be far more powerful than a standard smartphone wallet. Multi-application plastic wallets are likely to be embraced on a wide scale in the future, making the shift to EMV all the more important for retailers who want to accept credit card payments using technology that’s consistent with industry standards. \n\nMobile credit card payment that connects buyer smartphones to merchant devices still requires a chip or SD card to be installed. Since EMV cards require nothing more than a budget-friendly piece of plastic, they’ve overtaken smartphone wallets and fulfilled security needs more robustly than phone payments ever could\n\n## What is the Liability Shift?\nTo encourage chip card payments, card brands required merchants without EMV compatibility to cover their fraud losses if they’d not yet made the shift by October 2015. Retailers lose [$580.5](https://wallethub.com/edu/credit-debit-card-fraud-statistics/25725/) million to debit card fraud each year. The federal card network policy protects buyers from liability for fraudulent transactions, but until 2015, merchants were shielded from it too. Card issuers will bear fraudulent losses as long as you have an EMV reader, making this technology one of the cheapest “insurance policies” you’ll ever have. Most US consumers now have chip cards, and while the technology isn’t bulletproof, it’s resulted in a drastic drop in 'card present fraud'. \n![emv card payment prevent fraud](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/4XRjUwV8U0iYGGEoIkEgyg/0f34f2c530d704cea038035252771ea9/emv-card-payment.png)\n## How Does EMV Prevent Card Present Fraud?\nEvery time you accept credit cards payments, they become vulnerable to chip and skim attacks, which clone cards to process fraudulent transactions. Cambridge University’s security researchers have found that the best way to avoid card present attacks is to implement EMV securely according to industry standards. Certified terminals make cards harder to counterfeit, which is why fraud is steadily moving to online payment ecosystems, but merchants still hold plenty of sway over how secure their EMV implementation will be. A secure credit card payment app adds power to an already sturdy technology. Look for an application certified by EMVCo with end-to-end encryption. Each transaction should verify that the card is present and “engaged” in the transaction—in other words, that the card and its user are at the transaction site. \n\nTo achieve this, a secret encryption key is authenticated as a part of each transaction. Only the card and issuer have access to it, and it can’t be taken from a previous transaction. If fraudsters can access that number, the entire system falls short. This is why encryption is so important. Your reader should process a credit card without sending critical information into cyberspace. SumUp terminals make it difficult to process stolen data by not making that data available in the first place. Think of encryption as invisible prison bars—it’s that much harder to cut through something you cannot see. \n\nFrance adopted EMV before most other nations, and today it loses about $436 million a year to credit card fraud to [the USA’s $3.1 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/419628/payment-card-fraud-losses-usa-by-type/). Much of the improvement is because malware is difficult to deploy on a credit card payment machine with a secure application program interface (API). \n\n## What is an API?\nAn API is an interface used to create your credit card payment app. It’s responsible for processing your transactions, keeping track of your stock, and controlling loyalty programs. APIs can’t offer reasonable security unless they’re designed for their unique purpose. A one-size-fits-all approach is no approach at all. \n\nSince your API can access every dark corner of your system and its resources, the way it’s used is critical to fraud prevention. Today’s invincible app is tomorrow’s vulnerable one, so when you choose a processing partner, look for one that evolves with the market and its threats. For the moment, the secret codes used in authentication are nearly impregnable, but leading card companies are constantly updating their apps so that the walls they build remain as solid as they’ve always been. SumUp doesn’t merely accept credit cards payments, it maintains your security over the long-term, much like an armed response unit. It also adds value to your point of sale by introducing functions like inventory control and couponing. If you’ve always wanted to launch a loyalty program but have lacked the capital to implement it, your SumUp reader will make it possible without demanding an upfront fee. \n\n## iOS SDK 9\nIf you or your staff are Apple users, SumUp uses iOS 9 SDK to accept credit card payments instead. This environment requires a secure connection in order to work, or the entire transaction is blocked. Security needn’t be complicated to be effective, and this is a prime example of simplicity at its most powerful. \n\n## How Flexible is EMV?\nSome readers can only process contactless transactions, others manage contactless and magnetic strip, and still others handle EMV. Since traditional solutions like magnetic strips are still in use in the USA, merchants can only serve all buyers if they accept all three payment configurations. SumUp serves every form of card payment, leaving none of your buyers out in the cold. \n\n## How do Fraud Reports Work?\nIf a buyer’s bank asks for more data about a transaction and it is disputed, a fraud report notification is generated by the bank. Credit card companies also use a range of other protective measures like irregular account activity alerts and pre-purchase verifications. Suspicious transactions are verified directly with the card user via email or phone--just one more way EMV keeps you and your customers safe. \n![fraud reports credit card payment](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/2ax2UZbMxqsQS6uAE4eY08/bf323decd83666cad6337538355e7bfb/fraud-reports-credit-card-payment.png)\nBuyers’ experience at your point of sale is an inherent part of their experience of your brand. A feeling of safety is integral to that. A reliable cyber security system can produce returns of as much as [100% or $40, 000](http://www.csoonline.com/article/3010007/advanced-persistent-threats/how-to-calculate-roi-and-justify-your-cybersecurity-budget.html) a year in savings alone, making it one of the most important investments you can make. Contactless solutions are often as close to free as the industry can manage, contributing to your profits in enough ways to overjoy your marketing team. If it’s revenue you want, SumUp will lead you to it.

When John Biggins developed the first credit system in 1946, charge cards were nothing more than rudimentary slips of paper, but within four years, the credit industry was booming. Diners Club was first to jump on the bandwagon, followed swiftly by American Express in 1958. By the time the swinging Sixties rocked and rolled their way into the world, MasterCard and Amex were thriving. Neither credit card companies could have imagined how far their innovations would evolve. Today’s systems use radio frequency identifications, antennae, and microchips to process payments anywhere at any time. Few wallets in the USA lack a microchip. The next growth spurt will come from online card payments processing, as mobile wallets, transportable point of sale devices, and biometric security systems overtake the market.\n\n## Preparing for Tomorrow's Payment Processing Technology Today\n\nMuch of the POS industry’s future will simply be more widespread versions of the technology that’s already available today. Mobile processing will one day create the first truly cashless society. [Contactless payment systems with biometric authentication](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2014/10/18/mastercard-zwipe-fingerprint-sensor-credit-cards/#ac8143010817) were introduced to Asian markets in April 2017. These systems will soon use palm vein patterns and iris recognition without the need for batteries. Today’s retailers are thus left with only two options: to introduce EMV payment systems as a foundation for the coming years or sink under the weight of the innovations that are about to dominate the business world. The security offered by the EMV technology in use today is unparalleled, and while mobile card processing will soon be the new global standard, the only way to gain that functionality is through EMV implementation.\n![credit card processing safety emv technology](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/12YF8fLCOiWEucYesaYI2g/973f4444da769b410c56eb8703d5eb9e/credit-card-processing-safety.png)\n## EM What? \n- EMV is the technology created by Europay, MasterCard, and Visa to allow terminals to connect directly with a card’s microchip, which generates a cryptogram to prevent fraud and theft. In simple terms, EMV chips are like tiny computers that carry and transfer information to and from mobile devices.\n- Contactless mobile payments can be achieved with NFC (near-field communication) or the more advanced Bluetooth technology. These techniques are often misunderstood to be independent of EMV, but they’re actually extensions of chip and sign cards. For this reason, EMV implementation is the only way to lay the foundation for future advances.\n\n### The United States Steps into the Race\n\nAlthough the United States only implemented EMV as a national standard recently, many facets of it are already mandatory. The 2015 liability shift placed responsibility for card fraud firmly on business’ shoulders if they lacked EMV technology. The only way to insure yourself against liability is by processing EMV cards, but not doing so is doing your customers a disservice, too. Magnetic stripes are easily replicated because they store information that never changes. Counterfeiters can thus easily convert them into cash. EMV chips generate a new transaction number every time they’re used. They can’t be duplicated in traditional ways, and as long as your reader encrypts all the data it receives, EMV protects against identity theft as well.\n\nHistorically, the credit card sector has only used partial solutions to theft to save pennies in exchange for exorbitant credit card processing fees. EMV is the first sound investment into fraud protection made by the industry in years, and it’s come with even lower fees for its users. For example, industry leader, SumUp charges no monthly costs or fixed fees. Only one fee is ever levied per transaction, and it’s calculated as a percentage of the payment. Credit card processing for small business has at last become a viable option, even for companies that need to manage transactions at their clients’ doorsteps.\n\n### Your Future through Analytics\n\nTomorrow’s business world will be more automated and artificially intelligent than even George Orwell could have imagined, but analytics and AI are already raising profits today. The days when credit card payment processing was simply a method of payment are over. Today, your card reader is not just a POS system, but a business partner, gathering information that can enhance every aspect of your business from its executive management to its accounting. The data captured by credit card processing machines is valuable, and it can be converted to insights that affect your bottom line. The key to creating a flexible analytics strategy lies in the universality of its software. Credit card processing that feeds data into programs like Excel immediately gains the capacity to extract information from a huge range of compatible analytics applications. Card payments processing can integrate with your:\n- Payroll and human resources management by recording each staff member’s sales and hours.\n- Marketing department by gathering Information about your current promotions and campaigns. This way, marketers can adjust and improve on their efforts while gathering information about your demographic.\n- Loyalty and gift card programs.\n- Accounting department by automating cash ups and other aspects of bookkeeping.\n- Product research and development including niche industry insights such as restaurant menu optimization and shift preparation.\n![payment processing actionable analytics](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/48kQacQxZS6E4UQySwKSmS/16dc7b8c41745010d15c1ab1bc05ec82/payment-processing-analytics.png)\nActionable analytics can be taken to their zenith with API-created applications that link to your credit card processing reader. They will turn your data into visual information and provide static dashboards so that you can achieve flexibility with your metrics and small data. This way, you’ll be able to monitor your sales as they relate to any corresponding promotions, product lines, or human resources strategies you’ve implemented. You belong to the era of big data. All you have to do to benefit from it is choose a credit card payment processing tool that can integrate with API applications.\n\n## The Mobile Credit Card Processing Generation\n\nOne day, simply tapping one device to another will be enough to process a payment, but merchant credit card processing has already shifted into a mobile landscape. Seven percent of Android users and 17% of Apple users had used mobile credit card processing by the end of 2015. The trend had a patchy beginning, partially disrupted by the EMV revolution, which offered better technology than mobile alone could provide. Tap-to-pay technology is still evolving, with wrist devices and the like entering the market. As mobile credit card processing becomes more secure, smartphones will become a more common way to handle contactless payment processing. Until then, readers like SumUp are small and mobile enough to travel door to door or table to table. Credit card payment processing has changed the way businesses operate, allowing them to accept payments online and off from anywhere, as long as there’s a mobile phone or tablet in reach.\n\n## The Future of e-Commerce\n\nCharles Stack created the world’s first online store in 1992, three years before the internet became fully commercialized. Globalization is now in full swing, and in the coming decade, Inc.com projects that the boundaries between on and offline businesses will evaporate. If you think the internet is the marketplace of the future, though, you’d be wrong. M-commerce (mobile commerce) is expected to be the next giant trend, leading point of sale systems globally. Automated payment processing will detect client preferences and their price sensitivity so that card processing can integrate more thoroughly into your marketing strategy. Customized card payments processing will eventually advance to offer each unique buyer a specialized pricing and payment structure so that you lose fewer shoppers at the point of sale, but it’s not too early to start putting personalized programs in place.\n\nSumUp gives you access to a wide range of payment applications through API management tools. API stands for application programming interface, and it lets you create applications and services that “plug” into your reader. Technophobes needn’t worry about development—there are a host of applications ready and waiting for you that can manage subscription plans, automate your billing, and manage your inventory. API can turn credit card processing for small business into an automated, highly intelligent business analyst who interacts uniquely with every buyer you have.\n\n## The Credit Card Crisis\n\nCredit card data breaches have been a sore point in the industry for years, and their costs seep into the lives of your buyers as much as they detract from your revenue. Customers can and do move onto alternative retailers if they feel your payments aren’t secure enough. The press is quick to publish every data breach catastrophe that happens, frequently creating a social media crisis of epic proportions that affects you more than you might realise. EMV has created a significant dent in these numbers in all 80 of the countries that have used it. Retailers experienced a [26% drop in card counterfeiting](http://www.businessinsider.com/visa-emv-cards-are-reducing-fraud-2016-6) year over year due to EMV migration. Contrast that to the annual 20.6% increase in card fraud until now and you find chip and sign technology is winning the race.\n\nHistory proves that theft will always evolve with the technology that fights it, and a 2016 Iovation/Aite Group study found that the majority of tomorrow’s credit card fraud will come from payments processed online without a card. In other words, the mobile and chip card revolution will do precisely what it was intended to do: eradicate card counterfeiting.\n\n## Your Point of Sale, Tomorrow\n\nWhen whisky dealer, James Ritty, developed the first point of sale system in 1879, he called it “incorruptible.” It was a simple tool to prevent staff thefts, but it was the first step towards what has become a $36 billion industry. It was only in the disco era that cash registers became computerized. By 2014, m-commerce solutions became the sector’s most important technological advancement, with chip and sign cards following closely behind. Today’s POS system doesn’t wait for buyers to come to it—it travels to customers wherever they are, but an even bigger revolution is on the way. Experts predict that, by 2020, the POS sector will be worth around $150 billion. This projection is critical to the way you handle purchases today because it spells out how sophisticated your POS strategy needs to be if it’s to compete. An EMV-based POS is, however, one of the cheapest ways to gain market share.\n![mobile credit card processing devices](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/4bbTw6Vtg4yeESg0u8og4M/5113691b35e7a9ec06e2cde78123d34e/mobile-credit-card-processing.png)\n## Your Future, the Profitable Way\n\nYour credit card processing system is only as useful as its software, which needs to support every operating system, integrate with all your other programmes, and fit seamlessly into your point of sale strategy. SumUp’s software development kit 9SDK) functions on Android and iOS. Transaction IDs are generated for each payment, and sensitive information is kept off your phone. The terminal is one of the few on the market that encrypts sensitive information so that your buyers’ data never falls into the wrong hands.

Imagine paying only for the cards you process. Imagine a reader that uses any iOS or Android device as its hub. Imagine a point of sale that’s as mobile as your delivery team. SumUp has at last directed its attention towards U.S. soil after a successful launch in the UK. The mobile point of sale company has stretched to include some 15 countries, and its success can be pinned on one simple fact: This is a reader that focuses on what businesses need from their readers, and not what banks want. This way, your profits go where they belong: in your account. \n\n## The End of Credit Card Fraud in One Simple Step\nPayment nightmares had become so all-encompassing in 2015 that the USA was responsible for <a href=\"http://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/86413-of-the-worlds-credit-card-fraud-happens-in-the-us\">47% of the world’s credit card fraud</a>. Chip and sign cards are a seamless and airtight solution that have already proven themselves in UK markets, yet the U.S. is dragging its feet on the transition to EMV technology. The sluggishness hasn’t gone unnoticed. Fraudsters have been working overtime to exploit magnetic strip technology before the U.S. draws a line underneath the chip and sign transition. Criminals pushed counterfeit card fraud up by 12.5% in a bid to benefit from the lack of security while they still can, but that’s not the absurd part. That label goes to the fact that those who don’t have an EMV credit card reader now have to cover the fraud loss themselves. All that’s required to bolster your business’ liability is the capacity to process chip and sign cards. Think of it as your insurance policy.\n![mobile credit card reader fraud security](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/yrRW8mD2NMgkAaiggOiWa/6ddde252ede4b50d7f291d7add1aa168/mobile-credit-card-reader-security.png)\n## Making Sense of the Change\nEMV technology operates through a chip that’s kept on the client’s card. It’s currently nearly impossible to counterfeit. When the UK introduced chip and pin cards to the market, it enjoyed a 70% reduction in counterfeiting over a decade. This is not necessarily the most powerful benefit of a mobile credit card reader. EMV readers are packed with software and hardware that enhance the way you do business. If you’re a small merchant, this technology is budget-friendly enough to bring your business into the new era. If you have a travelling company, your point of sale easily moves with you. SumUp also comes with a range of applications that lift weight off your bookkeeper’s and even marketer’s shoulders. \n\nYour credit card reader can keep track of your stock, feed figures into Excel spreadsheets, and automate your cash ups until they’re ready to be processed by your accountant. Once your data is in Excel, you gain the benefit of Microsoft’s analytics sites. This way, you can not only find out which staff are pushing the most profits, but also what stock is performing best for your company. Power Query streams your data into the cloud so that it’s available to all branches of your company. Power Pivot crunches your data into usable models. You can even discover the geographical areas that are serving your business best. There is a reason the data revolution is still buzzing with energy: it drives revenue exceptionally well, and you needn’t be loyal to only one operating system. SumUp is a credit card reader for iPhone and Android. The Air card reader connects via Bluetooth to Samsung Android and iPad, too. \n\n## The Payment Race\nPoint of sale systems may seem like one of the most pointless parts of your business to strategize, but the reality is not so forgiving. Since the personal computer became a part of retail store point of sale systems in 1983, sales have been rising and expenses, decreasing. A well-deployed <a href=\"http://www.dionco.com/public/articles/POS_Study_White_Paper.pdf\">POS typically lifts sales by 20%</a> and reduces expenses by 15% within six months. Profit margins rise by 25% and net profits increase by 30%. Your mobile credit card reader can even reduce your staff compliment. The causes of these effects are wide ranging. \n\n- Cash register time is reduced, shortening queues at peak hours.\n- Card purchases are processed faster.\n- Software with easy-to-use prompts reduces margins of error.\n- Stock control is easier to achieve. Low stock levels are instantly recognizable.\n- Payroll information is automatically recorded to reduce the need for clerical staff.\n- Delivery and mobile versions of your business can be deployed to stretch your reach and thus your profits.\n- Budgeting and inventory needs are made available without complex data entry.\n- Better inventory control translates directly into fewer lost sales.\n![credit card readers the payment race chart](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/47zgjkHqLK0MCaq6cCQwkM/19005d64d31e2af918104afce7fa52b1/credit-card-readers-race-chart.png)\nThese days, your point of sale can become whatever you want it to be. The era of monetized software is slowly coming to an end as freeware becomes widely available. This gives you all the functionality you could hope for from a portable credit card reader without any extra expense. If you want powerful automation and analytics, you can have it with only a minor change in your hardware. A reader with an app that sends data straight to Excel puts a huge collection of freeware at your fingertips. Profit chasing has never been simpler. \n\n## POS Through the Centuries\nThe first POS system was designed in the 1800s to give saloon owners a way to prevent staff theft. The first cash register was merely designed to store money away from greedy hands, but in the 1970s, the fast food industry began to revolutionize payment strategies. POS evolved into a way to make staff more productive, record orders, and accept cash. When personal computing emerged, restaurants developed touch screen POS systems. The retail industry followed with the development of the first POS hardware for general use, thereby introducing an array of brand new needs to point of sale software: inventory management, data analytics, and the management of cash by employees. Security threats evolved with the criminals spearheading the shift, and card readers began their own revolution. The United States is behind much of the world in terms of banking. Even some third world countries have speedier card processing capacities and more secure systems than the United States. As the nation migrates, so will its readers. The first stage of the transition to EMV has focused on authentication that doesn’t require a dial-out authorization. As merchants adopt chip readers, speeds will improve. Currently, the US’ version of EMV behaves differently to Europe’s, processing at a speed of 4.4 – 11 seconds. EMV cards will eventually be processed within a fraction of a second, just as they do offshore.\n\n## A Mobile Credit Card Reader with Many Talents\nAn Android or iPad credit card reader can be used to cut IT exponentially. Before a credit card reader could be used to control your point of sale, retailers frequently spent thousands of dollars on their systems that inevitably needed to be upgraded within a few years. Today’s wireless credit card reader can be programmed to perform all POS functions, even if you have multiple staff members operating their own credit card reader. Your employees’ personal mobile devices can be used as hubs because SumUp is as much a credit card reader for Android as it is a reader for iOS. Since almost 70% of U.S. consumers already have EMV chip cards, migration is no longer a matter of choice. In choosing a contactless reader, you’re choosing a partner who will develop with a rapidly growing industry. SumUp intends to expand its technology to cover all POS requirements, but for now, cash payments can be monitored through your terminal. Receipts can be provided regardless of the payment type used. \n![credit card reader for iphone or android or ipad](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/49tqb0orv2sMWW8AM0kqaa/79a8d0f6c91f298317ebc98e3b0b0b76/credit-card-reader-iphone-android.png)\n## Protecting Your Buyers\nUsing a contactless reader that doesn’t protect customer data is risky. In an age of identity theft and in a country as litigious as the United States, only the highest data security standards will do. If your terminal doesn’t transfer data using PCI-DSS, your clients’ information is exposed. Similarly, secure sockets layer and transport layer security are needed to encrypt card data at the highest level. Global privacy standards should also be in play. A focus on identity theft has become critical with the adoption of EMV technology. Counterfeiting has been taken off the table, so criminals have been opening new cards under consumers’ contact details instead. SumUp is one of the few readers with 256-bit encryption that sets in as soon as the card is dipped, so that data can’t be monetized through fraud. \n\nEMV transactions are put through several separate computations. The card is authenticated, fraud is detected, risk is assessed, and signature verification is performed. There is a fair amount of flexibility here, though, so not all readers are created equal. Cryptography is an optional extra, and one your clients will expect as part of your service to them. It’s only reasonable that merchants do all they can to secure their buyers’ information. \n\nEMV is changing the payment ecosystem drastically. Starbucks experienced almost 5 million mobile payments a week in 2014, and it’s EMV technology that’s laying down the infrastructure needed to support this kind of payment. Preparing with a gold-standard reader is laying the foundation for change ahead of what will be a complex and expensive transition in the years to come. As with all forms of business strategy, choosing an option that scales to your growing company and the dynamic nature of the marketplace is the most intelligent and economical solution you can choose. \n\n","fullWidthImage":{"id":"6snxwGIA7Y4cIUeSKM44q6","updatedAt":"2017-06-26T10:59:48.484Z","title":"sumup credit card reader and smartphone","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/6snxwGIA7Y4cIUeSKM44q6/93f38ae1c8e28f8d4df568a4792ffffa/sumup-credit-card-reader.jpg","details":{"size":107321,"image":{"width":1920,"height":932}},"fileName":"sumup-credit-card-reader.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"secondaryContent":"## SumUp offers you the best solution in card payments\nWith SumUp, you can quickly and easily accept credit and debit card payments with your smartphone or tablet.\n\n<div class=\"btns btns--seo\">\n  <a href=\"https://sumup.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=credit-card-reader\" class=\"btn btn--cta\">\n  Learn more about SumUp!\n  </a>\n</div>","seoLinks":"### Popular articles  \n\n- [Credit Card Processing Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow](https://sumup.com/credit-card-processing?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=credit-card-reader) - How to increase your small business revenue?

It should actively contribute to your marketing and stock control systems. It should also optimize your employees’ time so that they can put their focus where it belongs: on upselling. Once you’ve hammered together an effective POS strategy, analytics should be gathered to enhance the many diverse tasks your point of sale can now fulfil. Your EMV terminal should be sophisticated enough to contribute to every single department in your company. \n\n## Where is Point of Sale Today?\nIn the Nineties, all you needed to run an efficient point of sale (POS) was a basic magnetic strip payment terminal, a computer, and software. Despite how rudimentary POS systems were 20 years ago, a basic interface often used to cost tens of thousands of dollars. Today, that price has been dragged down drastically by open source code and freeware applications you can nip and tuck to fit your precise needs. The days of paying massive flat fees for an EMV terminal are as good as over. Readers like SumUp charge a negligible percentage of each sale with no additional costs for your bookkeeper to worry about. SumUp doesn’t even have an upfront cost. \n\nOne of the most dramatic improvements to contemporary POS systems is the existence of analytics and automation. You can effectively use the data your cashiers enter when processing a sale to inform your marketing team, refine your stock choices, and obliterate much of your accountant’s legwork. You needn’t know the difference between a one and a zero to use such innovative functionality. With a click or two, analytics software will automatically craft your data into digestible graphs and other formats, ready for your management teams to analyse. Your SumUp wireless credit card terminal can feed information into Microsoft Excel, automating much of the work your accountant usually has to do at snail pace. By taking labor intensive tasks off your staff’s shoulders, you can at last use their most profitable talents to raise revenue. \n\n## The Mobile Solution\nA credit card terminal with EMV processing power can travel anywhere a smartphone can. Every waiter in your restaurant can carry their own pocket-sized terminal, speeding up service and keeping your guests smiling. Your reader travels with your delivery people, who can use any Android or iOS device to process transactions the contactless way. Mobile businesses never need to worry about processing payments before service delivery again. \n![mobile credit card terminal how it works scheme](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/1MgT8nfA2EmSm8EakO4sU4/6f23502373f160de9833d04ef3b81411/mobile-credit-card-terminal-scheme.png)\nA recent study of businesses deploying new POS systems found that entrepreneurs had four primary reasons for upgrading: \n\n- 48% upgraded to cut out time-consuming point of sale tasks.\n- 33% wanted to shorten queues and serve clients faster.\n- 20% wanted to gain competitive advantage.\n- 12% wanted to improve customer loyalty through better service and loyalty programs.\n\n## The Customer-Centric Credit Card Terminal\nNearly half of all retailers believe that their POS systems eat up too much of their employees’ time. Failure to update to more efficient and accurate EMV technology has even worse effects than that, though. Price inaccuracy can directly drain your profits, and screen and keyboard malfunctions can cost you time and money. The inability to accept credit and debit cards has an obvious impact on your bottom line, while a lack of loyalty programs skims from your revenue indirectly, especially if your direct competitors are offering rewards. Implementing a new system that eliminates all these problems is easier and more economical than you might imagine, and it begins with your wireless credit card terminal. \n\n## Step One: Adding Card Terminal EMV Technology\nWith a little thought and effort, your credit card terminal can act as the foundation of your POS. While your SumUp reader only processes EMV cards, you can still run cash sales through it and, in so doing, replace your register entirely. How you build your next POS step depends on which operating system you use. \n![credit card terminals symbols](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/TL2VEtDEEmcG2cg6WEGKU/0cbfcaab5252e502d15504b3b1dd278e/credit-card-terminals.png)\n## Step Two: Adding a Point of Sale System for Microsoft and Android\n\nIf you’re a Microsoft client, an Excel point of sale application is easy and economical to implement because SumUp can convert all the data it receives into XLS format. Apps can even be installed on all your staff’s touchscreen devices, so it’s one of the most seamless ways to upgrade to EMV chip cards. In a single download, and often at no outlay, you can issue barcode sales bills, control your stock, complete end of month stock balances, and handle purchases. \n\nSumUp also graduates your POS to the cloud when you add web-based analytics software to your spreadsheets. Excel itself has an online version capable of churning up your sales statistics, but more evolved applications are worth considering. Advanced analytics apps can: \n\n- Track average inventory and shrinkage.\n- Assess your gross margin and sell-through percentages.\n- Calculate return on investment.\n- Calculate your average basket value.\n- Tell you who your most profitable employees are.\n\nWith that data, you can make more intelligent inventory choices and assess your buyers’ responses to your marketing efforts. Your store performance data gives you all you need to know about each branch of your business, while your employee figures can be used to inform a better talent management strategy. \n\n## Step Two: for iOS\nIf you or your any of your staff are Apple users, SumUp’s iTunes app emails or texts receipts to your client, accepts all credit cards, and transfers payments to your bank account. SumUp is the first to launch an open mPOS platform with native software development kits and application programming interfaces. Anti-fraud measures are built into the reader, adding an extra tier of security to the already airtight safety of EMV technology. Your iOS users can use browser-based applications, too, which means you can be entirely independent of all operating systems if you prefer to be. In essence, what all this jargon means is that your credit card reader has been opened up to third parties, so you can develop your own applications or download those created by others. \n\n## Step Three: Stock Control\n\nBy feeding product codes into your payment terminal, your inventory numbers can be updated automatically with every transaction. This lets you identify which items are selling well, which need replacement, and which are responding to your marketing efforts. \n\n## Step Four: Stay Secure and Integrate\n\nSumUp’s Checkout API lets you integrate stand-alone and omnichannel payments online and off so that card information never makes it to your server. All information is encrypted, and a new transaction is generated for each payment to prevent fraud. If you don’t want to embed your own web app, SumUp provides a custom checkout program. \n\n## Step Five: Use Your POS Register for Your Books\n\nWith the help of additional applications, SumUp’s POS can act as a pixelated version of your brick and mortar cash register, managing everything from multiple payment methods to discounts and reporting. It can: \n\n- Function in the cloud\n- Operate in offline mode.\n- Manage loyalty programs.\n- Handle a full suite of transactions over the phone or via tokenization.\n- Accept data about your clients.\n\nThe API also creates a pagination of transaction events so that you can control refunds, chargebacks, and orders. This data is easily transferred into your bookkeeping software to cut out the need for repetitive tasks. Transaction histories can be churned into metrics to inform your marketing and advertising teams. \n![new business model with emv credit card terminal](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/1MJjxDB9H6SEYAmeU2KUSc/801b70f3995384f3bd078745b98f3052/new-business-model-emv-terminal.png)\n## Creating a New Business Model with Your Credit Card Terminal\n\nToday’s POS systems are supposed to enhance your revenue and make life easier for staff, and your EMV terminalcan act as the central point around which the rest of your POS functions revolve. Before the new generation of contactless EMV readers hit the stands, how you accepted payments limited the mobility of your business. Fees were too steep to support more than a few card machines, and mobile credit card processing wasn’t an option. Today, your terminal can travel with you, so your business isn’t limited to your brick and mortar address. If you want to sell products at a convention, you no longer need a hard line. Contactless readers will carry you from outdoor markets to catered events without requiring you to prepare. If you’ve never thought about what your business model would look like if it was unconstrained to a physical address, it’s time to start. \n\nEMV technology is more than merely a tool for eliminating fraud. With a little thought, it will change the way you think about your company. If you’ve been in business for a decade, you’ve probably invested thousands in old fashioned POS systems. It’s time to wave goodbye to those unnecessary costs and say “hello” to tools that raise profits.

It has few useful security features, and it takes far longer to tally up at the end of a day’s trade than cards do. Cash abdicated its kingly throne years ago, and digital payment technologies are evolving at a full throttle.\n\nGlobal payment services are remarkably convenient for shoppers, and falling behind on electronic payment technology can cost a business a significant chunk of its profits. Affluent and low-wage shoppers need to be served equally well, and an EMV credit card reader achieves precisely that.\n\nIts ground-level processing fees and transport-friendly design makes it a practical solution regardless of your profit margins and the mobile nature of certain business models. The mobile boom means that almost <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US41725415\" target=\"_blank\">two billion new devices</a> were shipped in 2016 alone, and the business world needs to catch up. \n\n## Contemporary EMV Reader Technology\nWith devices becoming economical to manufacture and use, “good enough” is no longer good enough — your terminal should compete against the most sophisticated emerging technology available. __It’s now possible for even the smallest companies to carry pinnacle devices without breaking a sweat over their expenses.__\n\nChip technology relates to the computer chip on Europay, Mastercard, and Visa cards. It was deployed to lend security to shoppers and vendors alike. It protects against fraud by cutting back on replication and counterfeiting. Chip data also prevents criminals from getting away with transaction number theft.\n\nChip cards can be processed the old way: through traditional, hard-wired swipe machines, which are sluggish, heavy, and immobile. In contrast, a SumUp EMV card reader fits into the pocket, is feather-light, and can be taken wherever there’s a mobile phone signal.\n\n![emv card reader with wifi and bluetooth technology](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/2mG8aJpuaIIqA6AYie8qQI/0e173022d9faad32cd4597bee53964c2/emv-card-reader-wifi-bluetooth.png)\n\nSumUp’s card terminal uses Bluetooth technology to connect to its app on your mobile phone. Your client can choose whether to swipe, use a chip, or pay with their phone, and you receive their payment within a day or two.\n\nThe Air Card Reader makes use of your mobile phone’s buttons, which makes it even lighter than its UK predecessor. It’s compatible with Android and iOS and lets you straddle the shift to EMV chip technology without adding unnecessary expenses.\n\nA mobile EMV terminal needs reinforced hardware if it's to travel successfully, so SumUp Air is made with only first-class components, insured by a year’s warranty. It prepares you for the mobile payment revolution, which could dominate the market in as early as 2018.\n\nIn 2016, the mobile payment users rose to 37%, a number that’s expected to increase to 50% in 2017 and <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Payments-Will-Triple-US-2016/1013147\" target=\"_blank\">69% in 2019</a>. The only economical way to manage the exodus is by preparing while the chip shift is still occurring.\n\n## Stop Paying the Earth\nTraditional swipe terminals are expensive, generally adding a massive batch of fees related to everything from startup costs and termination to invoicing. A low-cost swipe machine could cost you between 3% and 4% per transaction, whereas a premium EMV card reader cuts away fixed fees entirely.\n\n__SumUp, the best in its class on U.S. soil, also comes without paperwork and termination fees.__ At 2.75% of every transaction, it’s among the most economical terminals in its class, with no monthly costs or delivery fees. The app and reporting tools are free too.\n\nSupport is provided via telephone and email at no extra cost to you. What’s more, if you’re feeling unsure about the migration to EMV, your EMV terminal is neatly wrapped up in a 30-day money-back guarantee. \n\n![emv terminal and analytics](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/5ZNfIJ1vd6iEacASUymYkq/12f9a66cbee32340f3246cfc835d959c/emv-terminal-analytics.png)\n\n## Your Analytics, Your Way\nIn today’s data-dominated society, no business can remain at its competitive peak without analytics to help it adjust. An EMV card reader is your ticket to the profitable world of small data. This gives your marketers and bookkeepers a wealth of information to process to keep your company ahead of the herd.\n\nYour payouts are automated, glitches are rare, and the application evolves with the SumUp team, who regularly improves stability and device compatibility. EMV credit card terminals can be updated without hardware changes, which keeps you up to date with changing consumer behavior. \n\n## The Liability Shift\n\nThe EMV card reader has taken the U.S. by storm. It’s the technical standard for an excellent reason: The liability shift now holds retailers accountable for all credit card fraud that happens in their establishments so nobody can afford to lag behind. The shift was made in 2015, but other countries around the world have already migrated. For nations like Australia and Canada, the EMV chip revolution has proved to be highly effective at preventing fraud.\n\nIn the U.S., compliance is the best way to avoid liability costs. \n\nWhen you accept credit cards, each card insertion generates a one-time code, which is then used to approve payment. This means the only way to process a card is by inserting it, effectively eliminating fraud.\n\nAs it stands, two-thirds of in-store fraud involves counterfeiting, making EMV credit card terminals the best way to manage risk. U.S. retailers have struggled to get their providers to offer chip processing capabilities. \n\n![credit cards liability shift with emv technology](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/29rvMJj2NGgawY6SQyQK8C/09a798274815546dfeb27a26ba38b287/credit-cards-liability-shift-emv.png)\n\nExisting point of sale (PoS) providers have been resistant to the chip shift due to their confusion about charges. Vendors can’t afford to lose their place in the race any longer, and an excellent (PoS) provider who develops its technology with the market instead of behind it is a much-needed asset.\n\nSumUp is such a provider, so when you migrate, you’re not merely buying an EMV card reader. __You’re investing in a long-term business relationship that gives you the competitive edge while your consumers evolve. __\n\n## Keeping Your Lines Moving\nSome chip terminals are still absurdly lethargic. Given that this technology has existed for two decades, this is a symptom of poor company management and not of EMV's capabilities.\n\nIf your terminal is causing a lag in lines and slowing down your deliveries, you own a veritable fossil-of-a-reader, and your provider is failing you. __An adequate EMV terminal should process payments faster than your tellers can handle cash.__\n\nMasterCard’s Chiro Aikat said, of chip technology, “this is the biggest thing that has happened in terms of consumer experience since the past 25 to 30 years.” It's thus supposed to make your point of sale simpler and quicker, and your clients should be delighted by your service.\n\n## Air: The Wave of the Future\n\nSumUp’s new EMV reader is a meager 7cm x 7cm, with a width of 2.5 cm. It lets you pre-save items for better stock control and makes your sale history available through its application.\n\nIt supports some wireless printers and can plug into devices that aren’t Bluetooth-enabled. Near Field Communication is also supported. This wireless technology exchanges data between devices as long as they’re held close together. \n\nSumUp has performed exceptionally well on major review sites, both regarding its app and the hardware itself. Its pricing model is transparent, and merchants are free to cancel the service at any point.\n\nThe company also holds a portion of payments in a reserve account as a fraud prevention strategy when necessary, which gives businesses a solid foundation for their security policies. \n\n## Cards Accepted\n\nExpect to have your card reader up and running in a matter of minutes. It supports an array of debit and credit cards and is certified by regulators including: \n\n- American Express ExpressPay\n- MasterCard PayPass\n- Visa ADTV and Ready\n- MasterCard TQM and TIP\n\n![accepted debit and credit cards](//images.contentful.com/ymgzv6evw2l1/3Jhuv7kHjG60MYkAosIEQM/1871e9a9084e11d84c02fc6aae965b8e/debit-and-credit-cards.png)\n\n## How it Works\n\nDuring a migration to EMV, the market tends to become somewhat fuzzy because client uncertainty reigns. The U.S. transition is happening slowly, so to weather the shift, you need an EMV credit card reader that tells your buyers whether to use a chip or magnetic strip.\n\nEach card and transaction can vary, but ultimately, all chip transactions will entail the insertion of the chip.\n\n## Full Speed Ahead\n\nEven some third world countries have migrated to chip technology and mobile payments. The USA is well behind the rest of the world when it comes to banking, but this has its benefits:\n\nNo U.S. merchant needs to adopt new PoS technology as though it’s The Great Unknown. There is a wealth of experience to refer to in countries such as Switzerland and the UK, who have already adopted the EMV reader as an industry standard. The switch to chip has entailed so few glitches that Sweden’s cash transactions accounted for a mere 20% of all retail sales in 2015.\n\nEmerging markets are starting to ban large notes, which means cash-oriented markets will soon be extinct. \n\nIn this day and age, in which rivalry is extreme and the evolution of competitive edge happens in a flash, it’s become increasingly important to prepare and adopt new technology ahead of your industry.\n\nSumUp is more than a mere terminal: it’s a payment partner, and one who has proved its mettle through constant, reliable innovation.\n\n---\n\n## In Summary:\n__The shift to EMV is inevitable. As modern merchants, we must embrace the EMV reader technology for our customers, our security and our competitive purposes. SumUp offers not only a card reader, but a full-blown service to satisfy all your payment needs, making it one of the best readers on offer.__\n","fullWidthImage":{"id":"6snxwGIA7Y4cIUeSKM44q6","updatedAt":"2017-06-26T10:59:48.484Z","title":"sumup credit card reader and smartphone","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/6snxwGIA7Y4cIUeSKM44q6/93f38ae1c8e28f8d4df568a4792ffffa/sumup-credit-card-reader.jpg","details":{"size":107321,"image":{"width":1920,"height":932}},"fileName":"sumup-credit-card-reader.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"secondaryContent":"## SumUp offers you the best solution in card payments\nWith SumUp, you can quickly and easily accept credit and debit card payments with your smartphone or tablet.\n\n<div class=\"btns btns--seo\">\n  <a href=\"https://sumup.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=emv-card-reader\" class=\"btn btn--cta\">\n  Learn more about SumUp!\n  </a>\n</div>","seoLinks":"### Popular articles\n\n- [The Credit Card Reader That Fits In Your Pocket and Suits Your Pocket](https://sumup.com/credit-card-reader?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=emv-card-reader) - Expand your knowledge about mobile credit card readers and increase your competitive edge by staring  to accept credit card paymnets on your iPhone, iPad or Android device.

What is EMV? Who Pays for Fraud? How Does EMV Affects My Point of Sale? ","hasTopbar":true,"heroTheme":{"id":"65GU7ym9cQI0gCwqUqsaik"},"heroHeadline":"How EMV Chip and PIN Technology Contributes to Security","hideFromGoogle":false,"date":"2017-07-20T00:00+01:00","primaryContent":"In 2014, credit card and data breaches climbed all the way to [1,540](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-security-id-theft-fraud-statistics-1276.php \"Credit card fraud and ID theft statistics\"), compromising over a billion records. The vast majority of that fraud happened within United States borders. 47% of cross-border fraud happened from the U.S. too, and experts blame it on America’s slow adoption of EMV chip cards. When the UK deployed credit card chip technology, their counterfeit fraud rates declined by 70%. Now that the U.S. has, at last, made the transition, those statistics will topple locally, too.\n\n## What is EMV?\nEMV stands for Europay, MasterCard, and Visa, the credit card behemoths who dominate the sector and developed the global standard for chip-based security. EMV has come to represent every credit card with chip, even those issued by smaller companies. Because the chips generate a new number for every transaction, they make counterfeiting almost impossible. The card is inserted into instead of swiped through a reader, and a signature completes the purchase.\n\n![picture of credit cards with emv chip installed](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/6ta3GQqvcc6CYQ8gO8uGIK/7fd7073db255f2628d16df13a4d2973a/emv-chip-credit-cards-picture.png)\n\n## Who Pays for Fraud?\nThe transition to EMV chip cards is good news if you have the technology to process them, but dire news if you’re still dragging your heels. Two years ago, retailers didn’t have to cover the counterfeit security breach tab, but now you do. The only insurance against liability is to offer your clients EMV technology.\n\nThe liability shift began late in 2015 to encourage retailers to adopt safer practices. At the time, the retail community complained bitterly to the National Retail Federation about the expense of upgrading to new card readers, but you needn’t pay a cent in upfront or fixed costs. Your typical EMV reader costs between $500 and $1000, alongside monthly and transaction fees. In comparison, SumUp EMV readers only charge a percentage of each transaction. They don’t demand upfront or monthly fees, so security during the liability shift is easily won.\n\n## How Does EMV Affect My Point of Sale\n\nThe biggest complaint thus far about EMV chip technology is that it processes cards at snail’s pace. When the transition was still happening, transactions were painfully certainly slow, as was buyer adoption. Now that 2017 has arrived, chip credit cards are faster than magnetic strips were.\n\n## How Does EMV Add Security?\n![symbol of emv chip security](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/6HYP35nwJOog2yOI2ceiMU/026cd1a503bf0523c8b9d137eb77cf8a/emv-security-symbol.png)\n\n### The EMV transaction flow has 10 steps.\n\n1. The terminal and card chip make an application choice.\n2. The terminal reads data from that application.\n3. Data is authenticated offline to make sure the card is not a counterfeit.\n4. Confirmation of the transaction and chip occur.\n5. Cardholder verification is done with a PIN, signature, or CVM.\n6. The reader checks floor limits and the like.\n7. The terminal requests approval.\n8. The card approves online or off.\n9. An online authorization request and authentication are completed and sent to the payment authorizer.\n10. The transaction is finalized and an issuing script is sent back to the card.\n\nIt’s been in use around the world since 2011 and is well tested through an estimated 19 million terminals. In addition to the extra steps involved in transactions, the signature authentication process is more accurate. PIN verification adds yet another fraud prevention layer. Identity theft becomes far more of a challenge with an EMV chip, too, since all the sensitive information magnetic strips freely gave away to criminals is secured. It’s important to note that EMV is not a new technology.\n\n## What Do Buyers Want?\nEMV chips are not merely a virtual Fort Knox for information, but a core customer service, too. They keep your buyers safe from breaches. In fact, the more aware the marketplace becomes of credit card chip benefits, the more it perceives the failure to adopt this technology as a customer service failing. The press has bombarded consumers with enough information to write tomes about the new standard. In 2014, 60% of buyers welcomed EMV, a number that grows with every passing day. Even so, EMV chip cards alone are not enough: the data your reader accesses needs to be encrypted, something that the vast majority of readers don’t do. Your defence of your clients’ privacy is only as powerful as your end-to-end encryption, which should be certified by EMVCo.\n\n## End to End What?\nEnd-to-end encryption is a system that limits communication to the users who are interacting. It defeats attempts to access the data on any software or credit card with chip by keeping that information indecipherable while it travels. This kind of encryption was once the terrain of programmers and IT geeks alone, but now you’ll hear laypeople discussing it over their afternoon tea. It’s become a part of everyday life given the sheer breadth of data theft worldwide. WhatsApp users are kept informed of it with every upgrade, and some basic journaling applications offer it. If something as benign as a blog offers encryption, how much more important is it when dealing with credit card data?\n\n## The History of Encryption\nThe internet passes information through a long string of routers, servers, and devices. At any stage, a hacker with a penchant for credit card fraud can intercept that data, so encryption was developed as a cure-all. The data on your chip is scrambled before it travels beyond your reader. When it reaches the correct recipient, it’s unscrambled. This is not a new tool. The Ancient Greeks used an encryption and authentication technique to protect Spartan military communication, and in 1500 BC, Assyrian merchants used it to protect their trade transactions. You don’t need to understand the jargon or participate in the encryption process to benefit from it. You only need to choose the right transaction partner. SumUp uses secure socket layer security because it’s the web’s encryption standard. Every EMV credit card can use the encryption as long as your reader can. There are no manual inputs or tasks involved on the retailer’s side. The magic happens automatically.\n\n## What About Card-Not-Present Fraud?\nThe EMV credit card transition has been 99.9% effective at preventing card present fraud in Europe. As adoption matures, the United States will probably see a rise in both magnetic strip and card-not-present fraud. This will upset the current balance, leading to more losses for retailers who are still relying on magnetic strips. Credit card chip and pin technology is thus your best protective measure for on and offline card processing, but your e-commerce business needs further mechanisms to keep data safe.\n\n![evolution and history of emv chip cards](//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/56jBGra0CkiQs8qScKoKUu/dc0891ee432af5c71fbf4fb68b6cec4a/evolution-emv-chip-cards.png)\n## The Evolution of EMV Chip Adoption\nThe first EMV chip card was issued in 2010 to give valued clientele an extra tier of security and create a globally accepted card. A year later, another 1.6 million users were given chip and PIN debit cards. When smaller issuers like JPMorgan Chase and U.S. Bancorp migrated to EMV, the momentum became unstoppable. However, the UK adopted chip and sign cards more widely long before the U.S. did. They wanted to introduce technology that could process transactions online and off, an ability that is still as relevant today as it was all those years ago. Offline endorsements involve the use of a signature, while online ones involve the use of PINs. Today’s credit card security happens in layers, with each new stratum adding an extra amount of security. If hackers get past the outer layer, they still have several more to pass through if they’re to reach the sensitive data in the center.\n\nThe UK’s EMV peak happened in 2008 when there was a 40% reduction in general fraud rates. These numbers rose to over 69% for face-to-face transactions. France experienced even more startling results. Their fraud rates on domestic face-to-face transactions stood at a mere [0.01% in 2009](https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/documents/rprf/rprf_pubs/120111wp.pdf).\n\n## What Else Can EMV Do?\nCredit card chip readers come with enough bells and whistles to be attractive to any retailer. They speed up your queues, simplify your point of sale, and even create records of your stock levels and bookkeeping data. Contactless terminals are also far more compact than their predecessors, so they can be carried from door to door in the pocket. Your business can thus be as mobile as you wish. All your reader needs is a mobile Android or iOS device to support transactions.\n\nEMV might have been developed to keep retailers and buyers safe, but it’s evolved to give small and medium-sized businesses access to business models that weren’t available to them before. You can now carry your point of sale anywhere and gain a new level of automation to support your human resources and accounting departments. Your data capture and processing workload have withered away into nothing, leaving your staff with extra hours to work on your revenue. With the right EMV partner, chip cards are your ticket to a profit boom.\n","fullWidthImage":{"id":"6snxwGIA7Y4cIUeSKM44q6","updatedAt":"2017-06-26T10:59:48.484Z","title":"sumup credit card reader and smartphone","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/txhaodyqr481/6snxwGIA7Y4cIUeSKM44q6/93f38ae1c8e28f8d4df568a4792ffffa/sumup-credit-card-reader.jpg","details":{"size":107321,"image":{"width":1920,"height":932}},"fileName":"sumup-credit-card-reader.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"secondaryContent":"## SumUp offers you the best solution in card payments\nWith SumUp, you can quickly and easily accept credit and debit card payments with your smartphone or tablet.\n\n<div class=\"btns btns--seo\">\n  <a href=\"https://sumup.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=emv-credit-card-chip\" class=\"btn btn--cta\">\n  Learn more about SumUp!\n  </a>\n</div>","seoLinks":"### Popular articles\n\n- [Accept Credit Cards the Secure, Speedy Way](https://sumup.com/accept-credit-cards?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=emv-credit-card-chip) - Learn more how to accept credit card payments on your iPhone or Android smartphone ✔ Support your company's growth with fast and secure card reader ready for liability shift EMV standard.\n\n- [A Credit Card Machine with Built In Ambition](https://sumup.com/credit-card-machine?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=emv-credit-card-chip) - Do you know that you can start accepting all credit card payments within few days without contract and hidden fees?
