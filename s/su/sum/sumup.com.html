    <p>2.2. We also use information collected about you in order to improve and personalise our Services. For instance, we may enable features in our mobile applications specific to your business.</p>

    <p>3.6. In any case, we will always ensure that your information will only be processed in connection with the Services and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection legislation.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Transferring Information Internationally</strong></p>

    <p>We may transfer information collected about you to members of our group of companies and third parties acting on our behalf that may be located in countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Countries outside the EEA may not offer the same level of protection for the information collected about you as those inside the EEA, although we will at all times continue to collect, store and use your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Data Security</strong></p>


    <p>5.1. We are committed to ensuring that the information collected about you is secure. We take reasonable measures including administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect your information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. When you are logged into your account, all Internet communication is secured using Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) technology with high security 128bit encryption.</p>

    <p>5.2. This high level of security can only be effective if you follow certain security practices yourself including never sharing your Account or login details with anyone. If you believe that any of your Account login details have been exposed, you can change your password at any time through our website or mobile application, but you should always also immediately contact customer service.</p>

    <p>5.3. Transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the security of the transmission of your information to us. Any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security structures to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

    <p><strong>6. Retention</strong></p>

    <p>We are required by law to retain certain records of the information collected about you for a period of at least ten years after termination of your Account. Otherwise, we reserve the right to delete and destroy all of the information collected about you upon termination of your Account unless you request otherwise. If agreed we shall continue to store your information, for example your transaction history, which you may require for accounting purposes.</p>

    <p><strong>7. Cookies &amp; Web Beacons</strong></p>

    <p>7.1. We use a number of cookies and web beacons within our website and applications. Cookies are small data files which are placed on your computer, mobile device or any other device as you browse our website or use any of our applications or web-based software. Web beacons are small graphic images or other web programming code which may be included in the website and any of our email messages.</p>

    <p>7.2. We may use cookies and web beacons for the following purposes: (i) To personalise our Services to you as an individual and to tailor our Services to you based on the preferences you may choose; (ii) to facilitate the effective operation of our websites and applications; (iii) to track website traffic or application usage for statistical purposes and to monitor which pages or features users find useful or not; (iv) to identify you upon Account login and to assist you when resetting your password; (v) to assist in meeting our regulatory obligations, such as anti-money laundering and anti-fraud obligations, and prevent your Account from being hijacked; or (vi) to enable us to link to our group companies’ websites.</p>

    <p>7.3. Some cookies may not be related to SumUp. When you visit a page on our website with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Facebook, cookies may be stored on your computer from these websites. We do not control the dissemination of such third party cookies and you should check these third party websites for more information about these cookies and their privacy policy.</p>

    <p>7.4. The cookies or web beacons will never enable us to access any other information about you on your computer, mobile device or any other device other than the information you choose to share with us.</p>

    <p>7.5. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but you may modify your browser settings to decline cookies. Rejecting cookies used by our website, mobile application or web-based software may prevent you from taking full advantage of them and may stop them from operating properly when you use them.</p>

    <p>7.6.
