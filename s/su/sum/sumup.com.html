<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
<p>We use information held about you in the following ways:
	</p><ul>
	<li>to operate and administer your SumUp Account,</li>
	<li>to provide you services, information and products that you have requested through the opening of your SumUp Account,</li>

</p><h2>Storing Your Personal Data</h2>
<h3>Where is it Stored?</h3>
<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, destinations outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") for the reasons set out below:
	</p><ul>
	<li>if this is necessary for providing you with the services you request. For example if you transfer funds to a merchant that is not located in the EEA, it will be necessary to send your details to that merchant,</li>
	<li>where our group companies, some of whom are based in the USA, store or process your data in accordance with our internal operational requirements and procedures in order to administer the services you require or in connection with anti-fraud measures,</li>
	<li>where you have consented to receive marketing material from our group companies,</li>
	<li>where our anti-fraud agencies, credit reference agencies and other service providers are based outside the EEA and require access to your data to perform their obligations to us and provide services to you,</li>
	<li>if you have been referred to us by a third party and that third party is entitled to a commission payment – for further detail see section 5.4.</li>
	</ul>
<p></p>
<p>We have taken and will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy no matter where it is located.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. To prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of information we have physical, electronic and managerial procedures in place to keep your information secure. Once logged into your SumUp Account, all internet communication is secured using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology with high security 128bit encryption, certified by Verisign Secured.</p>
<p>However, this high level of protection can only be effective if you follow certain security practices yourself. You must never share your SumUp Account or login details with anyone. If you are concerned that any of your login details have been compromised, you can change them any time once you are logged on but you should always also immediately contact Customer Service and tell us why you think your login details have been compromised. Please read our SumUp Account Terms of Use for further information on how to keep your SumUp Account safe. Details of how to contact Customer Service are available from the “Contact” section of the Website.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site. Any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
<h3>Retention</h3>
<p>We are by law required to retain certain records for a period of at least five years after closure of your SumUp Account which will include data such as your name, contact details, customer number and transaction history etc. Otherwise, we will delete and destroy all personal data that we hold about you when you (or we) terminate your SumUp Account.</p><p>
</p><h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
<h3>Group Companies</h3>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries who are based in different countries within the EEA. This may be necessary in order to, among other things, fulfil your request, process your payment details, provide support services and monitor fraudulent activities.</p>
<h3>Fraud and Credit Reference Agencies</h3>
<p>When you open a SumUp Account, at intervals of up to every 3 months and at any other time we feel it is necessary to do so to protect our financial interests and prevent money-laundering or fraud, we share certain information about you and your SumUp Account, financial history and transactions as part of our normal business operations with our banks, payment facilitator partners, credit/debit card processing services, identity verification service providers and credit reference agencies to identify and verify users, to limit our exposure to fraud and other criminal activities and to manage our financial risk. We can provide you with a list of the credit reference agencies we use upon your written request to the email address set out in the Contact Us section below. When conducting identification or fraud prevention checks, the relevant parties may retain a record of our query along with your information and may share this information with other fraud prevention agencies. If you want to know what information these companies hold about you, you can write to them to request access to your information.</p>
<h3>Other Disclosures</h3>
<p>We may also disclose your personal information to:
	</p><ul>
	<li>a prospective buyer of our business or a buyer of a substantial number of the shares in our business,</li>
	<li>the police, other lawful enforcement body, regulatory body or court if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data , or to protect the rights, property, or safety of ourselves or our group companies, our customers, or others, third parties where you have expressed an interested in receiving information about their goods and services, and third parties who referred you to us initially and to whom we owe a commission payment as a result of the referral. Where the commission payment is based on transaction volumes, numbers or types of transactions, we may share that information with that third party, but we will not disclose the full details of each of your transactions without your further written consent.</li>
	</ul>
<p>
</p><h2>Communicating With You</h2>
<p>We may contact you by email to the primary email address registered with your SumUp Account or by telephone to the contact telephone numbers you have provided when registering for your SumUp Account. You can change your primary email address and/or contact telephone number at any time, subject to the provisions of section 8 below.</p>
<p>You may also receive system-generated transactional emails such as confirmation of uploads, notification of receipt of payments, notification of password changes etc. which are necessary for the proper operation and administration of your account.</p>
<h3>Newsletters and Marketing</h3>
<p>As a SumUp Account holder, you will occasionally receive information by email from us, unless you have chosen not to receive such communication, and if you have consented to do so from our group companies too, about products, services and special deals which we think will be of interest to you via our newsletter. You can change whether or not you receive newsletters from us and our group companies in the “Profile” section of your SumUp Account or in any newsletter email by clicking on the appropriate ‘opt-out’ link. Please note that you will still receive communication regarding your SumUp Account such as transactional emails or other notification affecting the operation of your SumUp Account or our legal relationship.</p>
<p>From time to time we do share aggregated information about our customers’ use of our website and services with other companies for research and analysis purposes, but you cannot be identified from this aggregated information.</p>
<h3>Phishing</h3>
<p>Phishing is the name given to attempts to steal personal details and financial account details from a website user. “Phishers” use fake or “spoof” emails to lead users to counterfeit websites where the user is tricked into entering their personal details, such as credit card numbers, user names and passwords. WE WILL NEVER SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU FOR SUCH DETAILS AND OUR STAFF WILL NEVER ASK YOU FOR YOUR PASSWORD.</p>
<p>If you do receive such an email or are asked for your password by anyone claiming to work for us please forward the email or report the incident by email to our Data Protection Officer (contact details are at the end of this policy) or by contacting Customer Service.</p>
<h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>
<p>Our Website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>
<h2>Accessing and Updating Your Information</h2>
<p>If your personal or professional details (such as your name, address, or telephone number) change you must update your details in the “Profile” section of your SumUp Account or by contacting Customer Services via the “Contact” section of the Website as soon as you can. We shall not be liable for any loss arising out of your failure to keep your personal details up to date. Your address and phone number can only be changed once in any 3 month period.
