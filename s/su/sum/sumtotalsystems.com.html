      <p> SumTotal Systems is committed to protecting your privacy and earning 
        your trust. This policy discloses the privacy practices for the SumTotal 
        Systems web site (“SumTotal Systems site”). We use the information 
        we collect about you from the SumTotal Systems site to process orders 
        and to provide a more personalized experience as you use our products 
        and services. This policy explains how your personal information is safeguarded. 
        It is our intent to give you as much control as possible over your privacy 
        and personal information and the use we make of it in our business. This 
        policy may change, so please check back from time to time.</p>
      <p><strong>What kinds of personal information does SumTotal Systems collect?</strong></p>
      <p> In general, you can visit SumTotal Systems on the Web without telling 
        us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. The 
        more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better 
        we are able to customize your experience. We ask for information from 
        you in several ways from different parts of our Web site. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We ask for personal information from you when you become a registered 
          user of the SumTotal Systems site. You are required to register and 
          receive a logon name to be able to access and use certain features of 
          the SumTotal Systems site. We also request certain other optional information 
          that will enable us to provide you with a more personalized experience 
          when using the SumTotal Systems site. We will let you know what information 
          is optional, and you decide whether or not you want to provide that 
          information or to receive newsletters or third party correspondence. 
        </li>
        <li> In the course of using our site, we automatically track certain information 
          about you. This information includes what type of browser you are using. 
          This information may include the URL that you just came from and the 
          next URL you go to, regardless of whether these URLs are on our Web 
          site or not. It also includes your IP address. SumTotal Systems uses 
          this information to identify broad demographic trends that may be used 
          to provide information tailored to your interests. </li>
        <li>We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us 
          refine and improve the design and layout of our SumTotal Systems site 
          and the user experience. </li>
        <li>If you send us personal correspondence, such as e-mails or letters, 
          we may keep a record of that correspondence. We also periodically ask 
          users for feedback that we use to improve our service and products and 
          add new features. If you respond to these requests, we may keep a record 
          of your response. </li>
        <li>We also collect IP addresses for system administration. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <strong>How does SumTotal Systems use my information?</strong></p>
      <p> We collect personal information to give you a customized experience 
        and to help SumTotal Systems understand its customers better. SumTotal 
        Systems does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. 
        In the future, we may choose to do so with trustworthy third parties if 
        you consent to receiving newsletters and correspondence and e-mails from 
        third parties on the registration page on our Web site. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We use the personal information you give us to provide you with up-to-date 
          information about SumTotal Systems products and services. </li>
        <li>We may use the information we collect to notify you from time to time 
          about important functionality changes to the Web site, new SumTotal 
          Systems services and products, and special offers we think you will 
          find valuable. </li>
        <li>When you provide us with personal information to enter a contest or 
          promotion sponsored by SumTotal Systems or its partners, we use this 
          information to administer the contest and notify winners. We store all 
          information relating to such contests and promotions. </li>
        <li>We will deliver targeted advertisements to our customers using the 
          personal information you give us. Third parties provide us with advertisements 
          and identify an audience they want to reach. We display these advertisements 
          on our Web site to people who fit the criteria. We do not allow advertisers 
          to have access to individual account information. These advertisements 
          are usually banner ads and promotional e-mails. You will only receive 
          e-mail announcements of special offers if you have asked to receive 
          newsletters and/or third party information when registering on our Web 
          site. You can change your preferences at any time. </li>
        <li>We also research our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior 
          based on the information you give us.</li>
        <li> We compile and analyze this information on an aggregate or anonymous 
          basis. </li>
        <li>We use the IP addresses we collect to report aggregate or anonymous 
          information to our advertisers. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <strong>Who collects information?</strong></p>
      <p> When you supply personal information on a SumTotal Systems site, you 
        share that information only with SumTotal Systems unless you are specifically 
        told otherwise. If a company other than SumTotal Systems is gathering 
        or maintaining your personal data from our Web site, you will be told 
        before it is collected or transferred. You can always choose not to share 
        the information.</p>
      <p>When companies other than SumTotal Systems sponsor promotions, data collected 
        on the SumTotal Systems site in connection with these promotions may be 
        shared with the sponsor. Once again, if this is the case, you will be 
        notified before the data is collected or transferred, and you can decide 
        not to participate. Most of these promotions are limited to United States 
        or North American residents.</p>
      <p>If you leave our Web site using links to go to other third party Web 
        sites, those third parties may gather information about you. This privacy 
        policy does not cover the practices of those businesses.</p>
      <p> <strong>Does SumTotal Systems share my information?</strong></p>
      <p> Other than as stated in this policy, SumTotal Systems does not disclose 
        any of your personal information to third parties without your permission. 
        Read the following sections to learn more.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Business partners and sponsors<br>
          </strong>SumTotal Systems may disclose your personal information to 
          business partners or sponsors, but you will be notified beforehand and 
          will be able to choose not to share your information. Many promotions 
          give you the chance to request additional information from the sponsors. 
          When you ask for more information, you give SumTotal Systems permission 
          to send your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill 
          your request. Much of the time, only your e-mail address will be shared. 
          You will be notified if more information will be shared, and you can 
          choose not to share the information.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Third-party data and aggregate data<br>
          </strong>SumTotal Systems discloses aggregated or anonymous statistics 
          (for example, the percentage of users from the western U.S.) to prospective 
          partners and advertisers and for other lawful purposes.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Other situations<br>
          </strong>SumTotal Systems also may disclose your information where disclosure 
          is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone 
          who may be causing injury to or interference with our rights or property 
          rights, the users' rights, or others’ rights. In the same way, 
          SumTotal Systems will disclose information when we reasonably believe 
          disclosure is required by law or to comply with a legal process served 
          on SumTotal Systems or its web site. We may disclose your personal information 
          in the good faith belief that we must act under exigent circumstances 
          to protect the personal safety of users of the SumTotal Systems site, 
          or the public.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong> Do I have a choice about how my information is gathered, used 
        and distributed?</strong></p>
      <p> Yes. When you log in or register with SumTotal Systems, you can choose 
        to receive newsletters, information, and e-mails from SumTotal Systems 
        and third parties. If you change your mind, you can simply update your 
        account information on our Web site so that the information will not be 
        sent. It's your choice.</p>
      <p>Some of our promotions may request your e-mail address so that you can 
        receive periodic updates about the status of the promotion. When you participate 
        in these types of promotions, you will automatically receive promotion-related 
        e-mail; however, you can choose the no-e-mail option that some promotions 
        offer. Occasionally these promotion-related e-mail messages may include 
        targeted advertisements.</p>
      <p>You can make decisions about cookies. You can modify your browser preferences 
        to accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject 
        all cookies. If you decide to reject all cookies, you cannot participate 
        in SumTotal Systems services that require registration to participate.</p>
      <p>We will notify you any time we want to transfer the data we have collected 
        or share it with a third party, and you always have the option to forbid 
        the transfer.</p>
      <p><strong> What security precautions does SumTotal Systems take to protect 
        me?</strong></p>
      <p> Your SumTotal Systems account information and profile are password-protected 
        so that you are the only one who has access to your personal information. 
        You can edit your account information and profile by using your logon 
        name and password. We recommend that you follow these guidelines to protect 
        yourself: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not tell anyone your password. If your password has been compromised 
          for any reason, you should immediately change your password. </li>
        <li>Do not respond to unsolicited e-mail by giving your password, even 
          if the e-mail claims to be from us. SumTotal Systems will never ask 
          you for your password in this way. </li>
        <li>When you are done using the SumTotal Systems site, sign out of your 
          account and close your browser window. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% 
        secure. Although we are committed to protecting your personal information, 
        SumTotal Systems cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information 
        you send to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own 
        risk.</p>
      <p> <strong>What are cookies and how does SumTotal Systems use them?</strong></p>
      <p> Part of our customized service involves using “cookies” 
        so that we can immediately recognize you, determine when you – or 
        someone using the same browser you previously used – revisits SumTotal 
        Systems, and to provide a more personalized experience. A "cookie" 
        is a chunk of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and 
        stored by your browser on the hard drive of your computer. Your browser 
        settings must be set to accept cookies before you can login or customize. 
        Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can usually change 
        your browser settings to refuse them. SumTotal Systems does not use cookies 
        to retrieve personal information about you from your computer. This policy 
        does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers on our Web site.<br>
        <br>
        SumTotal Systems uses cookies to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Locate your name and account information when you log in to our Web 
          site so that you can access your account information. When you log in, 
          the cookie is set, and when you sign-out, the cookie is modified. </li>
        <li>Estimate the size of our audience. Each browser that accesses SumTotal 
          Systems is given a unique cookie, which is used to calculate how many 
          people return to our Web site, compare the number of registered and 
          unregistered visitors to our site, and use customer interests and behavior 
          to target our advertisements. </li>
        <li>Help SumTotal Systems partners track visits and complete business 
          transactions. This information is sometimes called "clickstream" 
          or "click trail." </li>
        <li>Track the way you use our promotions, contests, and sales. When a 
          SumTotal Systems-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written 
          to the cookie tracks the user’s progress through the promotion 
          (for example, entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings). </li>
        <li>Measure the traffic to various areas of the SumTotal Systems site. 
          We measure the areas of the network of Web sites you visit and your 
          visiting patterns in the aggregate. This research helps us understand 
          the ways in which our customers are alike and the ways in which they 
          differ. We may use this information to personalize the information and 
          design in our Web site. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <strong>What about the privacy of children?</strong></p>
      <p> SumTotal Systems is a general audience Web site and does not request 
        the age of its customers. SumTotal Systems does not knowingly collect 
        any personal information from children. If a child wants to log in or 
        register at our site, we prefer that a parent or guardian do so instead 
        of the child. In this way, we have a parent or guardian's consent before 
        we gather any information from the user.<br>
