<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Context Media Technologies, Inc. ("Context") is the company that runs the
"Summify" service found at <a href="http://summify.com">
http://summify.com</a> (the "Site").  This is the Privacy Policy for
the Summify service. You accept it when you accept the complete
Terms of Service of the Summify service.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated by Context and this Privacy Policy may be
supplemented or modified by agreements entered into between you and Context
from time to time.</p>

<p>In this Privacy Policy, "personal information" means information
about an identifiable individual that is not the person's business contact
information or work product information. Any data about usage and service
operation that is not associated with a specific personal identity is not
personal information. As is true of most websites, Context collects and
analyzes non-personal data to evaluate how customers use the Site and the
Services. Non-personal data collected by Context may include the pages visited
on the Site, unique URLs visited within the Site, browser type and IP address.
Most non-personal data is collected via cookies or other analysis technologies.
</p>

<h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>

<p>Context collects personal information from you when you subscribe for
services or products, and may from time to time collect additional personal
information in the course of providing such products and services. Context uses
such personal information as is reasonably required to process your
registration for the Site and to provide services and products to you.</p>

<p>Contact information that you provide to Context may be used to contact you
in connection with the Site. For example, depending on which privacy
preferences you have indicated to Context, we may use your contact information
to provide periodic newsletters or to provide notices regarding changes to the
Site or regarding new services or products.</p>

<p>This Site may allow you to publish personal information about yourself and
others. By publishing your personal information on such pages, you consent to
the publication of such personal information. By publishing personal
information about another individual, you represent that you have, where
required by applicable privacy laws, obtained the consent of such individuals
to publish such information.</p>

<p>Context collects demographic and profile data in connection with the Site
and uses such data to tailor each visitor's experience at the Site, showing the
user content in which Context thinks you might be interested, and displaying
the content according to your preferences.</p>

<p>Context may use customer information for additional purposes that may be
identified at or before the time that the information is collected.</p>

<h2>Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>

<p><strong>Context may disclose personal information as follows:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>to third party service providers and to affiliated entities in order to
  carry out work on behalf of Context,</li>
  <li>to law enforcement agencies for the purposes of investigating fraud or
  other offences,</li>
  <li>to legal, financial, insurance, and other advisors or in connection with
  the sale, reorganization, or management of all or part of its business or
  operations, and</li>
  <li>as consented to by you from time to time, including to fulfill any other
  purposes that are identified when the personal information is collected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Context will not use or disclose personal information for purposes other
than those for which it was collected, except with your consent or as required
or permitted by law.</p>

<h2>Cookies and IP Addresses</h2>

<p>Context may use your IP address to help identify you and your subscription,
gather broad demographic information about our users, diagnose problems with
Context systems, and administer the Site. The Site uses cookies to deliver
content specific to your interests, according to your preferences, and to save
your password so that you are not required to re-enter it while you use the
Site.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>The Site may contain links to other websites. Context is not responsible for
the privacy practices or the content of such websites. Please ensure you review
the privacy policies of the websites that you visit.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Context protects against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal
information with security measures appropriate to the sensitivity of the
information. However, it is possible that any information transmitted via the
Internet may be intercepted by unknown third parties.</p>

<h2>Opt-Out</h2>

<p>When appropriate, users of the Site are given the opportunity to (i) opt-out
of receiving communications from us, (ii) remove their personal information
from our records, or (iii) elect to no longer receive services from Context. If
