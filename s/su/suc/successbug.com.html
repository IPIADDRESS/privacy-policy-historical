<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PRIVACY POLICY</span></h1>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your   experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and   we want you to use the Internet’s vast array of information, tools, and   opportunities with complete confidence.</p>
<p>We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm   commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how   our company collects information from all end users of our Internet   services (the “Services”), including those who access some of our   Services but do not have accounts (”Visitors”) and those who may   purchase Products and/or pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the   Service (”Members”).  This Policy also explains what we do with the   information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have   concerning the collection and use of such information. We request that   you read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p>Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when   they sign up for our Products or Services including name, address,   telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number),   and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The   personal information collected from Members during the registration   process (or at any other time) is used primarily to provide a customized   experience as you use our Products and Services.  Your information  will  never be licensed or sold to any third party.  However, we may  make  limited disclosure of personal information under the specific   circumstances described in the “Disclosure” section below.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disclosure </span></strong></p>
<p>We may disclose Member and Visitor information to the following third   parties, under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Companies who work on our behalf:</strong> We contract  with other  companies to perform business support functions on our  behalf, which  may involve limited access to your personal information.  We require  these companies to use the information only to provide the  contracted  services; they are prohibited from transferring the  information to  another party except as needed to provide those services.  Some examples  of these business support functions include order  fulfillment, coupon  fulfillment, award and rebate fulfillments, customer  survey execution  and information systems management. We also may make  aggregate  non-personal information available to select service  providers.</li>
<li><strong>Subsidiaries and joint ventures:</strong> A subsidiary or a  joint  venture is an organization in which we own at least a 50%  interest. If  our Company shares your information with a subsidiary or  joint venture  partner, our Company will require that they not transfer  your  information to another party for marketing purposes or use your   information contrary to your expressed choices. If you have indicated   that you do not want to receive any marketing information from our   Company, we will not share your information with our subsidiary or joint   venture partner for their marketing purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Co-branded and Partner Pages</strong>: Our Company may  share  information with partner companies who jointly present special  offers  or promotions on co-branded pages within our site. You will be  notified  of this sharing when you are asked to furnish personal data on  such a  page. The partner’s use of any information you submit will be  governed  by the partner’s own privacy notice, which you can review  before  submitting your information.</li>
<li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> Our Company reserves the  right to  transfer your personal information in connection with the sale  or  transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets. If the  business  is sold or transferred, our Company will give you an  opportunity to  tell us not to transfer your personal information. In  some cases, this  may mean that the new organization will not be able to  continue  providing to you the services or products that our Company  provided.</li>
<li><strong>Law Enforcement:</strong> Our Company may disclose  personal  information to third parties without your consent for any of  the  following reasons: to comply with any law, regulation or court  order,  to cooperate with Government investigations, to help prevent  fraud or  to enforce or protect the rights of our Company or its  subsidiaries.</li>
<li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> In all other cases, our  Company will  obtain your express consent before sharing your information  with third  parties. For example, our Company may conduct a joint offer  or contest  with a third party and you will be asked whether your  personal  information should be shared with that third party.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Online Shopping </span></strong></p>
<p>If you order services or products directly from our Company we will   use the personal information you provide only to process that order. We   do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent   necessary to complete that order.</p>
<p>If you complete an order for some other company(ies) that may be   linked to our Site, such as an online gift order sent directly to a   recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the recipient,   such as the recipient’s name, address, and phone number. Our company  has  no control over the third parties’ use of any personal information  you  provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing  so.   We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the Privacy and  Terms  of Use policies of any other company(ies) whose web sites you may  access  from our site.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Online Advertisements</span> </strong></p>
<p>Our company may display our online advertisements. In those cases we   share aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors and   Members collected through the registration process as well as through   online surveys and promotions with these advertisers.</p>
<p>Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and   non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements or joint   ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us   the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement   tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying   information we have collected, we may then display or send the   advertisement to the intended audience. Our company does not share   personal information about its Visitors or Members with these   advertisers or joint venture companies.  Information about how to   opt-out of online advertisements you may receive from our Company will   be contained in the ads themselves.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Responses to Email Inquiries</span> </strong></p>
<p>When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to our company, the   return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. Our   company does not use the return email address for any other purpose  and  does not share the return email address with any third party.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Voluntary Customer Surveys</span></p>
<p>We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer   surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys   because they provide us with important information that helps us to   improve the types of products and services we offer and how we provide   them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain   strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party.   Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.  Information about   how to opt-out of surveys will be contained in survey communications.</p>
<p>We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to   our customer surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses   of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses to   the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies,   education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic   information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the   quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and   products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be   shared with third parties.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Automatic Collection of Information</span></strong></p>
<p>Cookies:  Our Company may use ““Cookies” to collect information.   Cookies are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your   computer’s hard drive, at a web site’s request. Our Company Cookies do   not contain any personal information, but are used primarily as follows:</p>

<p>Our Company encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their   children online and to participate in their interactive activities and   interests.</p>

We urge you to take every  precaution  to protect your personal information while you are on the  Internet.</p>
<p>Services and Web sites we sponsor have security measures in place to   protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our   control.
