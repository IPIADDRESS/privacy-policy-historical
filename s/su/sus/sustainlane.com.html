	<p class="bodytxt-ind"><span class="c7">While you may use some of the functionality
	of our Sites without registration, some of the specific tools and services
	might require registration. If you do not register with or use the tools,

	through the use of Cookies (i.e., Small data files that are stored on the hard

	required and you choose to register through our Sites, we will require you to
	submit "Personally Identifiable Information" (i.e., Information that

	<p class="bodytxt-indc18"><span class="c15"><b>3.</b></span><span class="c14"><b> </b></span><span class="c17"><b>The Information We Gather</b></span></p>

	<p class="bodytxt-ind"><span class="c7">SustainableCircles gathers two types of
	information about users:</span></p>

	<p class="bodytxt-indc22"><span class="c15"><b>3.1.</b></span><span class="c14"><b> </b></span><span class="c7"><b>Non-Personal Information. </b></span><span class="c21">When users
	come to our Sites, we collect and aggregate Non-Personal Information
	indicating, among other things, which pages of the Site were visited, the order
	in which they were visited and which hyperlinks were "clicked."
	Collecting such information involves the logging of the IP addresses, operating
	system and browser software used by each user to our Sites. Although such
	information is not Personally Identifiable Information, we can determine from
	an IP address a users Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of
	his or her point of connectivity.</span></p>

	<p class="bodytxt-ind"><span class="c7">We also use Cookies to help us determine
	the type of content and sites to which a user to our Site links, the length of
	time each user spends at any particular area of the Site and the specific
	functionality that users choose to use. Essentially, Cookies are a users identification
	card for the SustainableCircles servers. Cookies are only read by the server
	that placed them, and are unable to execute any code or virus. Cookies allow
	SustainableCircles to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize
	your experience at our Sites. Cookies also may be used to facilitate a users
	log-in, but are not used to retain Personally Identifiable Information.</span></p>

	<p class="bodytxt-ind"><span class="c7">You should be able to control how and
	whether Cookies will be accepted by your web browser. Most browsers offer instructions
	on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies in the "Help" section
	of the toolbar. If you reject our Cookies, certain of the functions and
	conveniences of our Sites may not work properly, but you do not have to accept
	our Cookies in order to productively use our Sites.</span></p>
