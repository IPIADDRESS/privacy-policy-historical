              believes that strong electronic privacy is crucial for the ongoing 
              success of the Internet as a service, commercial and entertainment 
              medium. To this end, unless you designate otherwise, the information 
              you enter here will be known to only two parties: you and Submit 
              Express. We pledge that Submit Express will not release your personal

              the status of whether you wish to receive Submit Express offers 
              and communications at any time. When we do present information to 
              our advertisers, unless you tell us otherwise, it is in the form 
              of aggregate statistics compiled among all of our visitors' answers

              Each time a visitor comes to a Submit Express Web site, we collect 
              some information to improve the overall quality of the online experience. 
              At Submit Express content sites, we collect the visitor's domain 
              name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from ibm.com or yale.edu), 
              referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user 
              visited prior to clicking through to a Submit Express Web site), 
              and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh 
              platform). The Submit Express site collects visitor information 
              for purposes of product monitoring, product improvement and targeted 
              advertising. We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity 
              into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking 
              where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Submit Express 
              properties, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about 
              you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis 
              with our advertisers; but Submit Express will not disclose your 
              individual identity or personal data without your permission. When 
              Submit Express does present aggregated information to outside companies, 
              no one will be able to identify you or contact you. </font></font></p>

              Submit Express Web sites may use cookies for internal reporting. 
              Cookies are a standard Internet technology that allow us to both 
              store and retrieve login information on a user's system. Other companies 
              which place advertising on our site also have the ability to assign 
              their cookies to you in a process that Submit Express does not control. 
              However, cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines, 
              so these advertisers will not know who you are - and Submit Express 
              will not tell them without your consent. </font></font></p>

              Email and URL addresses used for our free submission and free META

              up to receive any of Submit Express Newsletters or mailing lists 
              by email, users will start receiving newsletters or emails delivered 
              on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, as well as occasional product-related 
              announcements. Note that every subscriber will go through a double 
              opt-in process to make sure that no one gets subscribed accidentally. 
              After a subscriber signs up on one of our sign up forms a confirmation 
              email will be sent to the subscriber. The subscriber will only be

              email addresses in order to distribute those newsletters and product-related

              with a number of other companies to distribute Submit Express newsletters 
              and mailing lists to users on their systems. Submit Express newsletters 
              and mailing lists are also offered in a number of Newsletter Partner 
              sites, all of which require a user's email address for distribution. 
              In the case of those email addresses collected by our Partners, 
              email addresses are either forwarded to us for maintenance by Submit 
              Express, or are kept and maintained exclusively by our Partners 
              under privacy conditions acceptable to Submit Express. If you are 
              concerned about the privacy policies of a Newsletter Partner site,
