<strong>6. Internet Users - Cookies, Internet Protocol (IP) Address, Aggregate Information</strong></p>
<p>Cookies - in addition to Personal Information, we use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain web pages to help analyse our web page flow and measure promotional effectiveness. A cookie is a small file, typically of letters and numbers, downloaded to an individual's hard drive while they are viewing the website. Cookies allow the website to remember important information that will make your visit to the site more useful. We use cookies to help improve your future visits. If you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or if you wish to turn off all cookies, use the options on your browser to assist you. The "Help" option on your browser may assist you in changing your cookie preferences. Please note that by turning cookies off, you will not have access to many features available on our website.<br>
Cookies can expire at the end of a browser session (from when a user opens the browser window to when they exit the browser) or they can be stored for longer.<br>
Session cookies - allow websites to link the actions of a user during a browser session. They may be used for a variety of purposes such as remembering what a user has put in their shopping basket as they browse around a site. They could also be used for security or to facilitate use of webmail. These session cookies expire after a browser session and would not be stored long term.<br>
Persistent cookies - are stored on a users' device in between browser sessions which allows the preferences or actions of the user across a site (or in some cases across different websites) to be remembered. Persistent cookies may be used for a variety of purposes including remembering users' preferences and choices when using a site or to target advertising<br>
First and third party cookies - Whether a cookie is 'first' or 'third' party refers to the website or domain placing the cookie. First party cookies in basic terms are cookies set by a website visited by the user - the website displayed in the URL window. Third party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than the one being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and a separate company sets a cookie through that website this would be a third party cookie.<br>

<p>Web Beacon - Also called a Web bug or a pixel tag or a clear GIF. We use pixels tags or transparent GIF files, to help manage our online advertising and promotions.  These tags collect anonymous (not personally identifiable) information about which advertisements and promotions bring users to our website.  With both cookie and tag technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. <br>
<br>
Used in combination with cookies, a Web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel that is placed on a Web site or in an e-mail that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the Web site or sending the e-mail. When the HTML code for the Web beacon points to a site to retrieve the image, at the same time it can pass along information such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that retrieved the image and previously set cookie values. <br>
<br>
Web beacons are typically used by a third-party to monitor the activity of a site. A Web beacon can be detected by viewing the source code of a Web page and looking for any IMG tags that load from a different server than the rest of the site. Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent Web beacons from tracking the user's activity. The Web beacon will still account for an anonymous visit, but the user's unique information will not be recorded. <br>
<br>
Internet Protocol (IP) Address - an Internet Protocol (IP) Address is associated with your computer's connection to the internet. SFAFT BV may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with SFAFT BV's server, to administer the Website and to maintain contact with you as you navigate through the Website. Your computer's IP address also may be used to provide you with information based upon your navigation through the Website. SFAFT BV does not link IP addresses to any Personal Information.<br>
<br>
Aggregate Information - is used to measure the visitors' interest in, and use of, various areas of the Website and the various programs that SFAFT BV administers, SFAFT BV will rely upon aggregate information, which is information that does not identify you, such as statistical and navigational information. With this aggregate information, SFAFT BV may undertake statistical and other summary analyses of the visitors' behaviors and characteristics. Although SFAFT BV may share this aggregate information with third parties, none of this information will allow anyone to identify you, or to determine anything else personal about you.<br>
<br>
<strong>7.  Compliance with the Digital Advertising Alliance</strong></p>
<p>SFAFT, an affiliate of SFAFT BV, uses the Evidon assurance platform to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) (http:///aboutads.info). As part of this service, SFAFT's online advertisements and Web sites are sometimes delivered with icons that help consumers understand how their data is being used and provide choice options to consumers that want more control.  The list of our advertising partners may be updated from time to time. To opt-out of internet-based advertising by all DAA-participating companies, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</p>
<p><strong>8.  Interest-Based/Online Behavioral Advertising</strong></p>
<p>On some pages of our site we may allow third-party advertising partners to set web tracking tools (e.g., cookies and web beacons) to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information regarding your activities on those pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such information we have collected with third-party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering future targeted advertisements to you when you visit other (non-SUBWAY®) sites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or "online behavioral advertising." <br>
<br>
Pages of our website that collect information that may be used by such advertising partners for interest-based advertising purposes may be identified by a link to AdChoices on the page.</p>
<p>Opting out (site pages). If you do not want your browsing while on such pages to be used for interest-based advertising purposes, you may click on the AdChoices link to opt-out of such uses by the listed advertising partner(s). Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your site activities and use it for non-interest-based advertising purposes as described in this privacy statement.</p>
<p>Opting out (advertisements). Advertisements on third-party sites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this privacy policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-personally identifiable information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners' use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes. Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect and use information from the advertisements for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.</p>
<p><strong>9.  Children and Data Collection</strong></p>
<p>SFAFT BV adheres to the United States Federal Privacy Protection standards as stated in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").  We care about the safety of children. We will not knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information. Children under 13 years of age are required to obtain the express permission of a parent or guardian before submitting any Personal Information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail address, and phone number) over the Internet.  If a child has provided us with personally-identifiable information without the consent of a parent or guardian, the parent or guardian of that child should contact the Privacy Officer immediately at fafprivacyofficer@subway.com. We will use reasonable efforts to promptly delete the child's information from our servers.</p>
<p><strong>10.  A Note to Parents/Guardians—Additional Information About Children's Privacy</strong></p>
<p>At SFAFT BV, children's privacy is important to us. Therefore, we take additional measures to help children protect their privacy while online including not asking them to disclose more personally identifiable information than is necessary for them to participate in an activity and encouraging them to use non-personally identifiable screen names rather than their real names.</p>
<p>SFAFT BV is dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal information we obtain from you with care and respect. This Children's Privacy Statement is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies and principles with respect to children under the age of 13.  SFAFT BV recognises the need to provide additional privacy protections when children visit our website at <u>www.subway.co.uk.</u></p>
<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal <br>
guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age; and that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our website.  Also, when we use the term "parent", we mean to include legal guardians.</p>
<p>Children can participate in many of our features without providing personally identifiable information. However, to enable their participation in certain of our interactive features, we may ask children to provide us with personally identifiable information. The types of information we may request include first name as well as the child's and parent's email addresses. We use a child's email address to respond to a specific request to participate in an activity (e.g., participate in a contest or sweepstakes, respond to their question, and enable them to subscribe to a newsletter). We use parents' e-mail addresses to obtain their consent or notify them of their child's online activities and enable the parent to unsubscribe the child from a newsletter or other similar activity.</p>
<p>We do not share children's personally identifiable information with outside third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy. Sometimes, we use agents or contractors to help us conduct a contest or sweepstakes, send prizes to winners, or provide customer service related to activities on the site. In these cases, we require the agent or contractor to keep the information confidential and to use it only for the specific services they are performing.</p>
<p>At any time parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their child and can request that any personal information we have collected be deleted from our records.</p>
<p>We will provide parents notice by e-mail of any material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and/or share their child's personal information. Please note that, at all times, parents should update their personal information to provide us a current email address.</p>
<p>If you would like to review any personally identifiable information that we have collected online from your child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child's information, or if you have questions about these information practices, you may contact our Privacy Officer.  The SFAFT BV Privacy Officer can be reached by telephone at: 0044 1223 550 820; by Facsimile at: 01223 844884; by email at: fafprivacyofficer@subway.com; or by mail at SFAFT BV Privacy Officer, In Care of, Subway® Realty LTD, Chaston House, Mill Court, Hinton Way, Great Shelford, Cambridge, CB22 5LD.</p>
