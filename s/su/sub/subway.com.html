<p><font size="3">Your
privacy is very important to us.&nbsp; This
Privacy Policy discloses how Doctor’s Associates Inc. (“DAI”) and its

information.&nbsp; We recognize the need for appropriate protection and management
of personal information that you provide to us.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy will
assist you to understand what types of information we may collect, how that
information may be used, and with whom the information may be shared.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In
an effort to comply with the law, and our commitment to protect your personal information,
we provide the following, which discloses our policies. Please note that this
Privacy Policy does not govern the privacy policies and procedures of DAI’s

<p><b><font size="3">What type of information do we collect?<br>
</font></b><font size="3">Personal
Information is any information concerning the personal or material
circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual. An identifiable
person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an

without requiring additional authentication.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We
will not collect Sensitive Personal Information, except to comply with
Affirmative Action data requirements. &nbsp;Sensitive Personal Information can
include but is not limited to: information pertaining to gender, disabilities
and veteran status. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Cookies – Internet Users</b><br>
In
addition to Personal Information, we use data collection devices such as "cookies"

assist you in changing your cookie preferences. Please note that by turning
cookies off, you will not have access to many features available on our
website.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Children and Data Collection</b><br>
&nbsp;We
care about the safety of children. We will not knowingly allow anyone under 13
to provide us any personally identifying information. Children under 13 years
of age are required to obtain the express permission of a parent or guardian
before submitting any Personal Information about themselves (such as their
names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Our Use of Your Information</b><br>
We
use your Personal Information to facilitate the services you request. We have
tailored our Privacy Policy to adequately inform you of the use of your
Personal Information. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Collection and Use of Employee Personal Information</b><br>
DAI
also collects Personal Information from its employees and applicants (human
resource data) in connection with administration of its Human Resources
programs and functions.&nbsp; These programs and functions include, but are not
limited to: job applications and hiring programs, compensation and benefit
programs, performance appraisals, training, access to DAI facilities and
computer networks, employee profiles, internal intranet employee directories,
Human Resource recordkeeping, Affirmative Action data, and other employment
related purposes.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It is the policy of DAI to keep all past and present employee
information private from disclosure to third parties. There are certain
business related exceptions and they are: </font></p>

												<ol>
													<li><font size="3">To comply with county,
state or federal agency requests; </font></li>
													<li><font size="3">Inquiries from third
parties with a signed authorization from the employee to release the
information, except in situations where limited verbal verifications are
acceptable (see below);</font></li>
													<li><font size="3">Third parties with
which DAI has contractual agreements to assist in administration of company
sponsored benefits. </font></li>
												</ol>

<p><font size="3"><b>Verifications of Employment</b><br>
Prospective employers, state agencies, financial
institutions, and residential property managers routinely contact DAI
requesting information on a former or current employee's work history and
salary. All such requests of this type shall be referred to and completed on a
confidential basis by the Human Resources Department or Payroll Department. 
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For written verification of employment requests, information
will be provided on the form only when it is accompanied by an employee's
signed authorization to release information. The form will be returned directly
to the requesting party and filed as part of the Human Resources or Payroll
Department’s confidential records.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Medical Information</b><br>
DAI
is compliant with federal HIPAA regulations and only utilizes information
related to the company sponsored healthcare plan on a "need to know"
basis for administration of the healthcare plan.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Collection and Use of Customer Information</b><br>
DAI
will not collect customer Personal Information, unless the customer contacts DAI
directly. In order to adequately address a customer’s concern, their Personal
Information may be shared with the area Development Agent and franchisee.
Development Agents assist with franchise sales, site location, training, and
provide operational assistance to franchisees. Failure to provide necessary
information may prevent DAI from fully addressing any customer concerns.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If
you are a participant in the Online SUBWAY® Store, we ask for contact
information, name, shipping address, phone number, and e-mail address. In the
future, we may use this information to contact you regarding products or
promotions, as well as other products and services, which may be of interest to
you. At any time you may “opt out” of future contacts by un-subscribing from
our database or contacting the Privacy Officer.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A
customer participating in Subway Express™ through the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.subway.com/">www.subway.com</a> website will be asked to provide
Personal Information. Our third party service provider collects and processes
customer information to expedite orders placed on Subway Express™. The Personal
Information collected shall include, but will not be limited to:&nbsp; name, e-mail
address, and telephone number. Our third party service provider forwards this
information to franchisees in order to fulfill the services offered through
Subway Express™. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Holders
of SUBWAY® Loyalty Cards and SUBWAY® Gift Cards (collectively the “SUBWAY® Card”)
may voluntarily register their cards through 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mysubwaycard.com">www.mysubwaycard.com</a>.
Our third party service provider collects Personal Information on a voluntary
basis. Information you may be asked to provide could include but is not limited
to: date of birth, card number, and e-mail address. Your purchase history may
also be linked to this information.&nbsp; This information is used as part of the
Lost/Stolen Card Program and to provide you with targeted offers from us or
from selected third parties, i.e. suppliers of products offered through the
SUBWAY® system. If you do not wish to receive promotional materials with your
use of the SUBWAY® Card you may update your preferences at 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mysubwaycard.com">www.mysubwaycard.com</a>.
Information is also collected in aggregate that is not considered Personal
Information, concerning the food items purchased and the demographics of the
purchasers. This information may be shared with DAI and its affiliates to
improve our product marketing and advertising. YOU MUST BE 13 YEARS OLD OR
OLDER TO REGISTER A SUBWAY® CARD. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Collection and Use of Franchisee and Prospective Franchisee Information</b><br>
By
applying to become a SUBWAY® franchisee, a prospective franchisee consents to
the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with
the following terms and conditions. We collect and use Personal Information in
order to assist a prospective franchisee in applying to become a SUBWAY®
restaurant franchisee and to assist DAI in selecting franchisee candidates. 
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Personal
Information collected from prospective franchisees include, but is not limited
to: name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, email address, date of
birth, citizenship, educational background, criminal background, bank account
information for Electronic Funds Transfer, financial statement, litigation
history, and taxpayer identification number. Failure to provide requested
Personal Information may negatively impact a prospective franchisee’s ability
to become a franchisee. Once a prospective franchisee becomes a franchisee,
they may then reference themselves by their Franchise Agreement Number. In
order to better service franchisees, a franchisee’s Personal Information may be
shared between DAI and its affiliates, pursuant to the service contracts
between them.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In
order to effectively implement the SUBWAY® Gift Card Program, and&nbsp;to provide purchasing
services to members, a franchisee’s Personal Information
may be shared with an independent purchasing cooperative or other independent
third party. The Personal Information shared with the independent purchasing
cooperative shall include, but will not be limited to: name, address, and bank
account information you provided to DAI to establish your pre-authorized
account for the payment of royalties, advertising fees, and other charges. &nbsp;Subject
to a franchisee’s agreement with the independent purchasing cooperative, the
independent purchasing cooperative may bill a franchisee’s bank account for
fees and other costs associated with the SUBWAY® Gift Card Program. If a
franchisee does not wish to disclose this information, they must notify the
Privacy Officer in writing as described in the section titled “Contact
Information” below.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A
franchisee and prospective franchisee’s information may be shared with the
Development Agent in their area. A Development Agent is an independent
contractor of DAI or one of its affiliates. Development Agents assist with
franchise sales, site location, training, and provide operational assistance.
Development Agents also make recommendations as to whether a prospective
franchisee in their territory should be granted a franchise. The Development
Agent may use this information to: address a franchisee’s concerns in a
customer complaint, respond to a franchisee’s inquires for franchise sales, and
any other inquiry which may require a response. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">A
franchisee’s information may be shared with our third party service provider in
order to implement Subway Express™ through the 
<a style="text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.subway.com/">www.subway.com</a> website. Franchisees may provide
information to the third party service provider directly or DAI may supplement
additional franchisee information to our third party service provider.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">DAI
will also share Personal Information in order to service franchisee leasing
needs and related administrative functions. Franchisee Personal Information may
be shared during store transfers. Finally, franchisee Personal Information may
be shared with Subway Franchisee Advertising Fund Trust (“SFAFT”) in order to
provide advertising services to member stores.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Finally, upon becoming a SUBWAY® franchisee you
consent to DAI disclosing former or past franchisee contact information
including Personal Information in its Disclosure Document for one (1) year
after leaving the system, as required by law, unless you advise. &nbsp;Contact our
Privacy Officer in writing, either by email or regular mail received, of your
desire to not have your details or contact information disclosed, corrected or
changed when you sell or transfer your SUBWAY® store, or exit the SUBWAY®
system (whether by termination or otherwise). &nbsp;To contact the Privacy
Officer, please see the section provided below entitled “Contact Information”. 
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Collection and Use of Development Agent Information</b><br>
By
applying to become a SUBWAY® Development Agent, a Development Agent applicant
consents to the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information in
accordance with the following terms and conditions. We collect and use
information in order to assist you in applying, and evaluating you to become a
Development Agent. Personal Information is collected to assist DAI and its
affiliates in selecting Development Agent candidates and for the purpose of
operating a development territory. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Personal
Information collected includes, but is not limited to: name, home address, home
telephone number, facsimile number, email address, date of birth, bank account
information for Electronic Funds Transfer, financial statement, resume,
taxpayer identification number and background checks. Once a Development Agent
candidate becomes a Development Agent, they may then reference themselves by
their Development Agent Number.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Failure
to provide necessary information may negatively impact your ability to become a
Development Agent.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Sharing of Personal Information</b><br>
We
may share Personal Information with our service providers, consultants and
affiliates for our internal business purposes. Except as described in this
Privacy Policy, DAI will not share Personal Information with a third party,
unless a customer requests, consents to such disclosure, or disclosure is
required or authorized by law. DAI reserves the right to disclose Personal
Information to a third party if a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, or
court order legally requires or authorizes us to do so. DAI also reserves the
right to disclose and/or transfer Personal Information to a third party in the
event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale, lease, merger, amalgamation or
any other type of acquisition, disposal, or financing of all or any portion of DAI
or of any of the business or assets or shares of DAI or a division thereof in
order for a franchisee or Development Agent to continue to receive the same
products and services from the third party.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As
described above, DAI, its affiliates, third party service providers and
Development Agents may share and exchange Personal Information in order to process
franchisee and Development Agent applications, administer the SUBWAY® franchise
system, implement the SUBWAY® Gift Card program, implement Subway Express™ and protect the integrity of the
SUBWAY® franchise system and trademarks. Personal Information may be provided
to a courier or freight forwarder in order to fulfill an order, which may have
been requested from us.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Our
Development Agents and other service providers are prohibited from using
Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide assistance.

and to comply with the general privacy principles described in this Privacy
Policy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Storage, Retention and Accuracy of Personal Information</b><br>
DAI
insures that Personal Information is safeguarded against loss, access, use,
modification, disclosure or other misuse. All reasonable steps are taken to
prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">DAI
will retain your Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill
the purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws,
and your consent to such purpose(s) remains valid after termination of our
relationship with you.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We
take all reasonable steps to insure that your Personal Information is accurate,
up-to-date, complete, relevant and not misleading.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">DAI may store your Personal Information in its databases located
in the United States and/or other countries outside of the United States.&nbsp; Additionally, some of our service providers may reside in the United States or other countries outside of the United States and will be subject to the laws of the
local jurisdiction.&nbsp; As a result, in certain circumstances, the United States and other foreign governments, courts, law enforcement agencies or regulatory
agencies may be entitled to access the Personal Information collected and held
by DAI.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Contact Information</b><br>
You
may contact the Privacy Officer to access, correct or delete your Personal
Information. If necessary, the Privacy Officer will contact another employee to
assist in completing your requested task.</font></p>
