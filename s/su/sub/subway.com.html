									</b>
									<p><font size="3">For the areas of the SUBWAY<sup>®</sup> web site where the collection 
											of personally identifiable information is necessary, you will know because you 
											will have to fill out a form. For most activities, we collect only your name, 
											e-mail address, birth date, and zip code. If you request a Franchise Brochure 
											we will also need your address and telephone number to send you information 
											about franchise opportunities. When you make a purchase from the Online Subway 
											Store, our affiliate the Franchisee Shipping Center Co., Inc. will also collect 
											your street and billing addresses, your phone number, and credit card 
											information. Depending on what you purchase, we may also need to collect other 
											personal information, like your clothing size. If you are participating in a 
											contest we may also need to collect your shipping address to forward any prize 
											won to you. If you fill out a job application, we will also forward your job 
											application information to the party or parties that you specify. Additionally, 
											we will forward customer complaints or feedback concerning specific 
											restaurants, to the owner(s) of the SUBWAY<sup>®</sup> restaurant. Otherwise, 
											we do not provide your information to third parties. You may unsubscribe from 
											all SUBWAY<sup>®</sup> mailing lists at any time.</font></p>

										<p><font size="3">Information Collected using Technology</font></p>
									</b>
									<p><font size="3">We may collect some information about you using technology, so it may 
											not be readily apparent to you that it is being collected. For instance, when 
											you come to our site your IP address is collected so that we know where to send 
											information you are requesting. An IP address is often associated with the 
											place from which you enter the Internet like your ISP (Internet service 
											provider), your company, or your school. This information is not personally 
											identifiable. We may use information collected through technology to make our 
											sites more interesting and useful to you. We normally don’t combine this type 
											of information with personally identifiable information. However, we may 
											combine this information with personally identifiable information to identify a 
											visitor in order to enforce compliance with our terms of service or to protect 
											our service, site, customers, or others.</font></p>
