<p><b><font size="3" face="Arial">What type of information do we collect?<br>
</font></b><font size="3" face="Arial">Personal Information is any information concerning the 
personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual. 
An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by 
reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his 
physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Personal Information shall include but is not limited to: 
identifying information such as name, home address, home telephone number, 
e-mail address, Social Security number, financial information and 
employment-related information such as may be found on resumes, applications, 
background verification information, or in employment references. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">DAI takes measures to maintain the confidentiality of your 
Social Security Number, to protect your Social Security Number from unlawful 
disclosure, and to limit access to your Social Security Number.&nbsp; DAI will not 
make your Social Security Number available to the general public, print your 
Social Security Number on any card, require you to provide your Social Security 
Number to access any products or services, transmit your Social Security Number 
over the Internet unless the connection is secure or your Social Security Number 
has been encrypted, or require the transmittal of your Social Security Number to 
access our Website without requiring additional authentication.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We will not collect Sensitive Personal Information, except 
to comply with Affirmative Action data requirements. &nbsp;Sensitive Personal 
Information can include but is not limited to: information pertaining to gender, 
disabilities and veteran status. </font></p>
<p><b><font size="3" face="Arial">Cookies – Internet Users<br>

<p><b><font size="3" face="Arial">Children and Data Collection<br>
</font></b><font size="3" face="Arial">DAI adheres to the federal privacy protection standards as 
stated in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).&nbsp; We care about 
the safety of children. We will not knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide 
us any personally identifying information. Children under 13 years of age are 
required to obtain the express permission of a parent or guardian before 
submitting any Personal Information about themselves (such as their names, 
e-mail address, and phone number) over the Internet.&nbsp; If a child has provided us 
with personally-identifiable information without the consent of a parent or 
guardian, the parent or guardian of that child should contact the Privacy 
Officer immediately at
<a style="color: blue; text-underline: single" href="mailto:privacyofficer@subway.com">
privacyofficer@subway.com</a>. We will use reasonable efforts to promptly delete 
the child's information from our servers.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3" face="Arial">A Special Note about Children who reside in the State of 
Maine, USA<br>
</font></b><font size="3" face="Arial">DAI adheres 
with the Maine state law titled "An Act To Prevent Predatory Marketing Practices 
against Minors". The law applies to the collection and use of personal 
information for marketing purposes of children who are under the age of 18.&nbsp; 
DAI’s website
<a style="color: blue; text-underline: single" href="http://www.subway.com">
www.subway.com</a> is not intended to solicit information of any kind from 
children under 18 years of age. It is possible that due to fraud or deception by 
others, we may unknowingly receive information pertaining to children under 18 
years of age. If this is the case, the parent or guardian of the minor must 
notify the Privacy Officer immediately at
<a style="color: blue; text-underline: single" href="mailto:privacyofficer@subway.com">
privacyofficer@subway.com</a>. Once we have verified the accuracy of the 
information received by the parent or guardian regarding the child under 18 
years of age, we will promptly delete the child’s information from our servers.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3" face="Arial">Our Use of Your Information<br>
</font></b><font size="3" face="Arial">We use your Personal Information to facilitate the 
services you request. We have tailored our Privacy Policy to adequately inform 
you of the use of your Personal Information. </font></p>
<p><b><font size="3" face="Arial">Collection and Use of Employee Personal Information<br>
</font></b><font size="3" face="Arial">DAI also collects Personal Information from its employees 
and applicants (human resource data) in connection with administration of its 
Human Resources programs and functions.&nbsp; These programs and functions include, 
but are not limited to: job applications and hiring programs, compensation and 
benefit programs, performance appraisals, training, access to DAI facilities and 
computer networks, employee profiles, internal intranet employee directories, 
Human Resource recordkeeping, Affirmative Action data, and other employment 
related purposes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">It is the policy of DAI to keep all past and present 
employee information private from disclosure to third parties. There are certain 
business related exceptions and they are: </font></p>
<ol start="1" type="1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">

<p><b><font size="3" face="Arial">Verifications of Employment<br>
</font></b><font size="3" face="Arial">Prospective employers, state agencies, financial 
institutions, and residential property managers routinely contact DAI requesting 
information on a former or current employee's work history and salary. All such 
requests of this type shall be referred to and completed on a confidential basis 
by the Human Resources Department or Payroll Department. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">For written verification of employment requests, 
information will be provided on the form only when it is accompanied by an 
employee's signed authorization to release information. The form will be 
returned directly to the requesting party and filed as part of the Human 
Resources or Payroll Department’s confidential records.</font></p>

<p><b><font size="3" face="Arial">Collection and Use of Customer Information<br>
</font></b><font size="3" face="Arial">DAI will not collect customer Personal Information, unless 
the customer contacts DAI directly. In order to adequately address a customer’s 
concern, their Personal Information may be shared with the area Development 
Agent and franchisee. Development Agents assist with franchise sales, site 
location, training, and provide operational assistance to franchisees. Failure 
to provide necessary information may prevent DAI from fully addressing any 
customer concerns.</font></p>

ask for contact information, name, shipping address, phone number, e-mail 
address, credit card information, and other related information necessary for 
billing purposes, such as a mailing address for credit card validation. In the 
future, we may use this information to contact you regarding products or 
promotions, as well as other products and services, which may be of interest to 
you. At any time you may “opt out” of future contacts by un-subscribing from our 
database or contacting the Privacy Officer.</font></p>

Franchisee Information<br>
</font></b><font size="3" face="Arial">By applying to become a SUBWAY® franchisee, a prospective 
franchisee consents to the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal

franchisee’s agreement with the independent purchasing cooperative, the 
independent purchasing cooperative may bill a franchisee’s bank account for fees 
and other costs associated with the SUBWAY® Gift Card Program. If a franchisee 
does not wish to disclose this information, they must notify the Privacy Officer 
in writing as described in the section titled “Contact Information” below.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">A franchisee and prospective franchisee’s information may 
be shared with the Development Agent in their area. A Development Agent is an 
independent contractor of DAI or one of its affiliates. Development Agents 
assist with franchise sales, site location, training, and provide operational 
assistance. Development Agents also make recommendations as to whether a 
prospective franchisee in their territory should be granted a franchise. The 
Development Agent may use this information to: address a franchisee’s concerns 
in a customer complaint, respond to a franchisee’s inquires for franchise sales, 
and any other inquiry which may require a response. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">A franchisee’s information may be shared with our third 
party service provider in order to implement Subway Express™ through the
<a style="color: #800000; text-underline: single" href="http://www.subway.com/">
www.subway.com</a> website. Franchisees may provide information to the third 
party service provider directly or DAI may supplement additional franchisee 
information to our third party service provider.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">DAI will also share Personal Information in order to 
service franchisee leasing needs and related administrative functions. 
Franchisee Personal Information may be shared during store transfers. Finally,

writing, either by email or regular mail received, of your desire to not have 
your details or contact information disclosed, corrected or changed when you 
sell or transfer your SUBWAY® store, or exit the SUBWAY® system (whether by 
termination or otherwise). &nbsp;To contact the Privacy Officer, please see the
