									<font size="3">This privacy policy discloses how Doctor’s Associates Inc. collects, 
										protects, uses and shares information gathered about you on our web site and 
										the web site for the SUBWAY® Card. Currently, the SUBWAY® Card is being 
										administered by Ontain Corporation on our behalf. We hope that this disclosure 
										will help increase your confidence in our sites and our level of customer 
										service. </font>
									<p><font size="3">While visiting the SUBWAY® web site and the SUBWAY® Card web site you 
											may be asked to provide information that personally identifies you. This 
											information is gathered on a voluntary basis to better serve you.</font></p>
									<p><font size="3">You may choose not to provide personal information and you still will 
											be able to visit most of the SUBWAY® web site but you will not be able to 
											register your SUBWAY® Card at the SUBWAY® Card web site. Doctor’s Associates 
											Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on the SUBWAY® web site and 
											the SUBWAY® Card web site. We collect personal information at several different 
											points on our Web site. The following items are a sample of areas in the 
											SUBWAY® web site where personal information is required in order for us to 
											assist you:</font></p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<font size="3">Job Opportunities with SUBWAY® franchised locations</font>
										</li><li>
											<font size="3">Subscription to Friends of SUBWAY® e-mail newsletter</font>
										</li><li>
											<font size="3">Request Information Concerning Purchase of a SUBWAY® franchise</font>
										</li><li>
											<font size="3">Sign Up for a Free Seminar about SUBWAY® franchises</font>

											<font size="3">Prospective Landlord Site Referrals</font>
										</li><li>
											<font size="3">Customer Service</font>
										</li><li>
											<font size="3">Purchases from the Online SUBWAY® Store</font></li>
									</ul>
									<p><b><font size="3">Information You Provide</font></b></p>
									<p><font size="3">For the areas of the SUBWAY® web site where the collection of 
											personally identifiable information is necessary, you will know because you 
											will have to fill out a form. For most activities, we collect only your name 
											and e-mail address. If you request a Franchise Brochure we will also need your 
											address and telephone number to send you information about franchise 
											opportunities. When you make a purchase from the Online Subway Store, our 
											affiliate the Franchisee Shipping Center Co., Inc. will also collect your 
											street and billing addresses, your phone number, and credit card information. 
											Depending on what you purchase, we may also need to collect other personal 
											information, like your clothing size. If you are participating in a contest we 
											may also need to collect your shipping address to forward any prize won to you. 
											If you fill out a job application, we will also forward your job application 
											information to the party or parties that you specify. Additionally, we will 
											forward customer complaints or feedback concerning specific restaurants, to the 
											owner(s) of the SUBWAY® restaurant. Otherwise, we do not provide your 
											information to third parties. You may unsubscribe from all SUBWAY® mailing 
											lists at any time.</font></p>
									<p><font size="3">If you fill out an Application for Additional Information to become a 
											SUBWAY® franchisee, we will seek extensive additional personal information. 
											Such information will be used solely for the purpose of determining your 
											qualifications to become a SUBWAY® franchisee. </font>
									</p>
									<p><font size="3">If you have not opted out of receiving marketing materials, we may 
											also use, but will not disclose, your personal information to promote and 
											market additional goods, services and special offers from us and our 
											affiliates.</font></p>
									<p><font size="3">You can choose not to allow us to use or disclose your personal 
											information for direct marketing purposes by indicating your preference at the 
											time of collection, by responding to the promotional email in the manner 
											provided for or by contacting our Privacy Officer in the manner described 
											below.</font></p>
									<p><font size="3">Typically, we will seek consent for the use or disclosure of your 
											personal information at the time of collection. In certain circumstances, 
											consent may be sought after the information has been collected but before use 
											(for example, when we want to use information for a purpose not previously 
											identified).</font></p>
									<p><font size="3">The form of consent that we seek, including whether it is express or 
											implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity of the personal information and 
											the reasonable expectations of the individual in the circumstances. </font>
									</p>
									<p><font size="3">You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual 
											restrictions and reasonable notice. If you wish to withdraw your consent at any 
											time, please contact our Privacy Officer in the manner described below. We will 
											inform you of the implications of withdrawing consent.</font></p>
									<p><font size="3">We will not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service, 
											require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of information 
											beyond that required to fulfill the explicitly specified and legitimate 
											purposes for which the information is being provided.</font></p>
									<p><b><font size="3">Information Collected using Technology</font></b></p>
									<p><font size="3">When you visit the Web site, we may collect some information about 
											you using technology, so it may not be readily apparent to you that it is being 
											collected. For instance, when you come to our site your IP address is collected 
											so that we know where to send information you are requesting. An IP address is 
											often associated with the place from which you enter the Internet like your ISP 
											(Internet service provider), your company, or your school. The following 
											information is logged by our web servers during visits to the Web site: IP 
											addresses, type of operating system, time and duration of visit, web pages 
											visited and browser type. We do not link server log information to any other 
											information in a way that would enable the identification of visitors to the 
											Web site. Server log information is analysed by us in order to improve the 
											website and to customize the website for users. In addition, from time to time, 
											server logs may be reviewed for security purposes; for example, to detect 
											unauthorized activity on the website. In such cases, server log data, 
											containing IP addresses, would be shared with law enforcement bodies in order 
											that they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the 
											unauthorized activities. </font>
									</p>
									<p><b><font size="3">Cookies</font></b></p>
									<p><font size="3">When you visit our Web site, we place a text file called a “cookie” 
											in the browser directory of your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are pieces of 
											information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the 
											Web site. These pieces of information allow the Web site to remember important 
											information that will make your use of that site more useful. Internet 
											companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. We use cookies to help improve 
											your future visits.</font></p>
									<p><font size="3">You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is 
											being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your 
											browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser 
											is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct 
											way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won’t have access to 
											many features that make your experience on our web site more efficient and some 
											of our services will not function properly.</font></p>
									<p><b><font size="3">SUBWAY® Card Program</font></b></p>
									<p><font size="3">Holders of SUBWAY® Cards may voluntarily register their cards through 
											the SUBWAY® Card web site, by mail, or by telephone. If you choose to register 
											your card, we collect personal information including your card number, name, 
											address, telephone number, e-mail address and date of birth. Your purchase 
											history may also be linked to this information. We use this information as part 
											of our Lost/Stolen Card Program and to provide you with targeted offers from 
											us, the SUBWAY® restaurants that you dine at, or from selected third parties, 
											i.e. suppliers of products offered through the SUBWAY® system whose offers we 
											will forward to you. If you do not wish to receive promotional materials with 
											your use of the SUBWAY® Card you may update your preferences at 
											www.mysubwaycard.com, call us at (800) 888-4848, or write to us at Subway 
											Global HQ, Customer Care, 325 Bic Drive, Milford, CT 06460. We also collect 
											information in aggregate that is not considered personal concerning the food 
											items purchased and the demographics of the purchasers. We use this information 
											to improve our product marketing and advertising.</font><b><font size="3"> YOU MUST 
												BE 13 YEARS OLD OR OLDER TO REGISTER A SUBWAY® CARD.</font></b></p>

											before providing them with any personal information.</font></p>

									<p><font size="3">While we are very happy to have you visit the SUBWAY® web site with 
											your children, the SUBWAY® web site and the SUBWAY® Card web site are general

									<p><font size="3">Although we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need
