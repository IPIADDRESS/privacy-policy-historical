                    Pixels (as known as web beacons/web bugs/Javascript) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are used to track the online movements of web users, track what other websites you visit (both before and after visiting our websites), or to determine whether you have performed specific actions. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user's computer or mobile device hard drive, pixels are small graphics that are about the size of the period at the end of the sentence that are embedded invisibly on web pages or in HTML-based messages. When you access our websites or open our messages, the pixels generate a notice of that action to us or our third-party business partners.

                    We keep information we collect for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in the <a href="#general-use-of-personal-information">Use of Personal Information</a> section above or as required or permitted by applicable privacy law.

                    You have a general right to access your personal information in our possession or custody. Upon receiving a written request (mail or e-mail) from you addressed to Subaru's Privacy Officer clearly identifying the requested information with adequate information to identify you, we will inform you of the existence, use, and disclosure of your personal information and give you access to your personal information. If we are not able to provide a list of the organizations to which we may have actually disclosed your personal information, we will provide you with a list of organizations to which we may have disclosed the information.

                    We will respond to your written access request with information in a form that is generally understandable, within a reasonable timeframe (generally within 30 days) or we will provide you with an explanation if additional time is required to fulfil your request. Our response will typically be provided for a minimal handling fee which we reserve the right to vary depending on the nature of the request and the amount of information involved. We will inform you of the approximate cost to provide the response, and will provide you with the information upon receipt of payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may question the accuracy and completeness of your personal information and request that we amend it as appropriate. If you demonstrate in a reasonable manner the inaccuracy or incompleteness of your personal information, we will amend the information as required. If a request is not resolved to your satisfaction, we will record the substance of the unresolved request. Where appropriate, the amended information or the existence of the unresolved request will be transmitted to third parties having access to the information in question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some situations, we may be permitted to refuse or not be able to provide access to certain personal information, and will upon request provide an explanation. Exceptions to the access right which are permitted or required by applicable privacy laws include the following:

                    By enrolling for or using SUBARU STARLINK<sup>®</sup> Services, you consent to us contacting you about the Services via the SUBARU STARLINK<sup>®</sup> System in your vehicle, your mailing address, your email address, and your home, mobile or business phone number on file.

                    SAFEGUARDS
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Subaru protects the personal information it holds or controls, by establishing reasonable security arrangements against loss, theft, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, copying or modification, commensurate with industry standards. We train our employees and Dealers on the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of personal information, and we exercise care in the disposal or destruction of personal information. Examples of safeguards include physical measures (such as locked filing cabinets and access cards), organizational measures (such as security clearances and restrictions on employee access to files and databases) and technological measures (such as passwords and firewalls).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, we require our third party service providers acting on our behalf to enter into contracts with us that ensure they will keep the information we share with them safe and secure. For example, our third-party service provider that processes your payment for SUBARU STARLINK® Services must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), which is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. This includes encrypting payment information using Secure Socket Layers (SSL) and transmitting it over a private Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network. Our third-party service provider that maintains your MySubaru account is required to encrypt all back-ups of personal information, logically separate the personal information we transmit to it from the personal information of its other customers, and use industry-standard password policies.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an additional security measure, we provide you with a Personal Identification Number (PIN), which you are required to use when you access certain SUBARU STARLINK<sup>®</sup> Services. Our SUBARU STARLINK<sup>®</sup> Connected Services Representatives may also ask you certain security questions to authenticate your identity. You must keep your MySubaru account password, security question answers and PIN safe from unauthorized access. If others have access to this information, then they may be able to access certain SUBARU STARLINK<sup>®</sup> Services. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In providing SUBARU STARLINK<sup>®</sup> Services to you, voice and data are transmitted between our SUBARU STARLINK<sup>®</sup> Connected Services Representatives and your vehicle over a cellular telephone network. While our third-party service providers must secure data transmitted over this network, the network is complex, and the privacy and security of conversations or data transmitted to and from the vehicle cannot be guaranteed.

                    Subaru transfers information outside of Canada including but not limited to the United States, Sweden, India and Japan, for processing by Subaru, its parent company (Subaru Corporation), affiliates or third-party service providers for some or all of the purposes described in the <a href="#starlink-use-of-personal-information">Use of Personal Information</a> section above. We use contractual and other means to ensure the information is protected while in the foreign jurisdiction. However, personal information may be still accessible to law enforcement agencies, government agencies, courts, and national security authorities of the foreign jurisdiction. If you have questions about our policies and practices regarding service providers outside of Canada, please contact Subaru’s Privacy Officer at the contact information at the end of this Policy.

                    Subaru will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the personal information we have is accurate, complete and up-to-date as necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used, including information that is disclosed to third parties, and information that is used to make a decision about an individual. Our reasonable efforts include obtaining updated information from our Dealers when you service your vehicle at the Dealer.

                        whether destroying the information will impact the services provided to you;

                    <li>
                        whether the information has been used to make a decision about you in which case we will continue to retain that information for at least one year after using it to make the decision to reasonably allow you time to access the information and to exhaust any access request or challenge you may bring under applicable privacy laws; and
                    </li>
