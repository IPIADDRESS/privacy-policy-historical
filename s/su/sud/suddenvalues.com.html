<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Protecting the privacy of our customers is a major priority of US Online’s SuddenValues.com mission and success. This Privacy Statement outlines how your personal information is collected and used by our network of websites and services that are located in the SuddenValues.com, SuddenSpecials.com and US Online.com domains and at participating merchant locations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION</strong>.<br>
US Online and its merchant customers, as it relates to their business, are the sole owner of information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, rent or otherwise distribute this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement or those provided at participating merchant locations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Visitors to our network of websites and participating merchant locations are offered the opportunities to register for promotional and informational email campaigns that are sent directly from SuddenValues.com and/or its participating merchant customers. In registration, users are required to provide contact information such as name and email address to receive these email campaigns, but may opt-out of future email campaigns at any time. If requested, via an email to opt-out@suddenvalues.com, visitors can receive a notice with the approximate date and source of where their contact information was collected.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><strong>DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION</strong>. <br>
Your personal information will never be sold, shared, rented or otherwise distributed to third parties for promotional use. Personal information is only disclosed in a limited set of circumstances: (1) to allow our Dealers to perform their duties in providing the services in their community, (2) to enable contracted third parties to assist in their support and (3) as required by law or regulating authorities. To the extent legally possible, we require each to maintain this information in confidence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><strong>PERSONAL TRACKING</strong>.<br>
To enable our participating merchants, Dealers and staff to best serve you, we use a variety of technology on our website and within our services to track usage. Some of these include browser based Cookies, email based Web Beacons and server based Log Files. These tracking technologies allow us to measure the success of the websites and services in order to best serve you and participating merchants. This information is never sold, shared, rented or otherwise distributed to third parties for promotional use.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>THIRD PARTY LINKS</strong>. <br>
We allow Dealers and participating merchants to provide links beyond our Websites and Service. As third parties, they may choose to collect information about you that we cannot control. Please review their individual privacy policies to understand how they collect and use personal information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURITY</strong>. <br>
We continually update the security features of our websites, services and supporting technology to protect your personal information. Our facilities are protected by state of the art security and watched over by security guards 24/7. All Dealers, participating merchants and staff are educated on best security practices.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><strong>OPT-IN / PERMISSION BASED SERVICE</strong>. <br>
We provide a permission based service, which means you must chose to signup online or at a participating merchant’s location. At anytime, you may chose to opt-out or make changes in your interest via a link provided in the footer of all email messages. You can also opt-out by forwarding the email to us at opt-out@suddenvalues.com.</font></p>
