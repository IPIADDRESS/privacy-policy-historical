<p><strong>1 What information do we
collect from you?</strong></p>

<p>Hearst Magazines UK collects
Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit our sites or when you
send us information or communications. "Personal Data" means data
that allows someone to identify you, including, for example, your name,
address, telephone and mobile numbers, e-mail address, as well as any
information about you that is associated with or linked to, or could be linked
to, any of the foregoing data.</p>

<p>"Anonymous Data"
means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data. </p>

<p>Anonymous Data does not permit
the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and
Anonymous Data, as described below.</p>

<p><strong>1.1 How we collect Personal
Data</strong></p>

<p>We collect Personal Data from
you, such as your name, contact details, country of residence, zip code or post
code, gender or birth date when you register on one of our sites or when you
choose to use the various services we provide. We also collect other types of
Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, when, for instance, you make
a purchase, respond to surveys and questionnaires, or enter a competition. If
you provide us feedback regarding our sites or services via e-mail, we will
collect your name and e-mail address in order to send you a reply.</p>

<p>In order to improve our
services to you, we may ask you to voluntarily complete confidential surveys.
We do not ask you to provide us any personally identifiable data in association
with these surveys although we do associate your responses with Personal Data.
If you do not wish to participate in a survey, however, simply decline to
participate when asked.</p><strong>1.2 Personal Data that we
collect from you about others</strong>

<p>If you decide to invite a
friend or family member to join any of our services, we will collect your name
and e-mail address as well as your friend's or family member's e-mail address
in order to send their e-mail. We will always ask your permission if we want to
mention your name when contacting your friend or family member. </p>

<p>This information is used once
only and is not saved in our database, unless they have entered a competition
or other promotion in which case their e-mail address is stored only for that
purpose. If you decide to invite a friend or family member to become involved
we will collect and save their e-mail address into our database, along with
their contact preferences, as we would for anyone who registers on our sites.</p>

<p><strong>2 How will we use the
information we collect?</strong></p>

<p>Hearst Magazines UK uses your
Personal Data to provide you with a customised
Web experience and to provide services to you. Such services include sending
you marketing messages if you have given us permission to do so, processing
your answers to quizzes and other competitions, and sending electronic
newsletters and promotional e-mails to you. We also use Personal Data for
customer service messages, and to notify you about updates to our services and
to respond to your requests.</p>

<p>We may create Anonymous Data
records from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that
makes the data personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous Data to
perform statistical analyses of users' aggregate behaviour so that we may
enhance the content of our services and improve site navigation. Hearst
Magazines UK reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data to third
parties at its discretion, in aggregate form.</p>

<p>If you elect to receive
communications from us we may periodically send you free newsletters and
e-mails that directly promote the use of our sites or the purchase of our
products or services and may contain advertisements for third parties.</p>

<p><strong>3 Do we share your Personal
Data with other companies?</strong></p>

<p>Except as otherwise stated in
this Privacy Policy and in our Privacy Notices where you give us your consent,
we do not sell, trade, or rent the Personal Data collected from our services to
third parties.</p>

<p>However, we will share your
Personal Data with our third party suppliers who need to process your data in
order to fulfil your request, such as to charge your credit card (if authorised by you), fill your
order, and deliver electronic newsletters and promotional e-mails. These third
parties are required under contract not to use your Personal Data other than to
provide the services requested by Hearst Magazines UK and to guarantee to our
satisfaction that they have sufficient processes in place to ensure the
security of your data whilst it is in their care. </p>

<p>You expressly consent to the
sharing of your Personal Data with our contractors and third party service
providers for the purpose of providing services to you.</p>

<p>If you send a testimonial or
comment to us, we may post it on our site or use it in advertising materials.
We will attribute your testimonial to you by posting your first and last
initial or your first name and last initial next to your testimonial on our
site or advertising materials, if provided. </p>

<p>Regardless of any choices you
make regarding your Personal Data Hearst Magazines UK may disclose Personal
Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a)
comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us;
or (b) protect or defend the rights or property of Hearst Magazines UK or users
of our services.</p>

<p>If another company acquires our
company or our assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by
it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal
Data as described in this Privacy Policy and the terms under which you
submitted your data.</p>

<p>If you provide Hearst Magazines
UK with your contact details and agree to receive promotional messages, we may
share your details with our affiliates or third-party businesses that offer
goods or services that we believe may be of interest to our customers. Many
customers appreciate the offerings they receive from such third parties;
however, we allow you to opt out at any time of having your Personal Data
shared with affiliated or unaffiliated third parties for the purpose of sending
you relevant information.</p>

<p><strong>4 Changing your mind about
marketing messages and keeping your details-up-to-date</strong></p>

<p>We offer you choices regarding
the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data. When you register on
one of our sites or respond to one of our communications or offers, we will ask
you if you want to receive future communications from us. You may indicate
consent to receipt of these communications by entering your personal details
and choosing what information you would like to receive, or by not ticking the
opt-out box provided. Should you decide to stop receiving further
communications from us, you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following
the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive or, on some of
our sites, by going to “Edit Your Profile”, or “My Account” after you have
logged in. </p>

<p>Despite your indicated
communication preferences, we may send you notice of any updates to our Terms
of Use or Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>If you are contacting us by
email, or by post please be sure to include your full name and address in order
in your opt-out request in order to allow us to process your request for any
changes to your preferences.</p>

<p>Note that we may retain changed
or deleted information in our archives, but we will not keep it longer than is
necessary.</p>

<p><strong>5 Other websites</strong></p>

<p>Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Privacy Policy or on this website, only Hearst Magazines UK
and its affiliate companies collect Personal Data through the services provided
solely by Hearst Magazines UK; this Privacy Policy applies only to the use and
disclosure of Personal Data that we collect while you use our services.</p>

<p>When you click on
advertisements or links on Hearst Magazines UK sites, you will leave that site
and go to another site. During this process, a third party (including a third
party advertising service that may provide services to an advertiser) may
collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you, such as the URL you just came
from, the URL you go to next, your browser type, and your IP address. Our
display of advertisements or links to any other company or site is for your
convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such company or site (or
the contents of the site). We have no control over, we do not review, and our
Privacy Policy does not apply to, these other companies, sites, or content, or
to any collection of data after you click on an advertisement or link to a
third party.</p>

<p><strong>6 Social
media, social commerce and other third parties.</strong></p>

<p>We work with trusted third
parties, including social network sites like Facebook, and with application
developers who specialise in
social media so we can connect to your social networks. Other social networks
we use include Twitter, MySpace and You Tube. All of these companies operate
Third Party Sites. We provide access to our Sites by third parties and business
partners so we can generate interest in our products and services among members
of your social networks and to allow you to share product and service interests
with friends in your network.<u></u></p>

<p>We cannot control how your
data is collected, stored, used or shared by Third Party Sites or to whom it is
disclosed. Please be sure to review the privacy policies and privacy settings
on your social networking sites to make sure you understand the information
they are sharing. If you do not want a Third Party Site to share information
about you, you must contact that site and determine whether it gives you the
opportunity to opt-out of sharing such information. Hearst Magazines UK is not
responsible for how these third parties may use information collected from or
about you.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>7 Where is your information
processed and how do we keep your Personal Data secure?</strong></p>

<p>Your Personal Data may be
processed both in and outside of your own country. When you submit your details
and in whichever country you are situated you agree to the data being
transferred to the UK and processed under the terms of the UK Data Protection
Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive)
Regulations 2003 which stem from European Directives 95/46/EC and 2002/58/EC
respectively. If you are not in agreement please do not give us your personal
details.</p>

<p>We may need to transfer your
data outside the UK (and possibly to places outside the European Economic Area)
and by using Hearst Magazines UK sites, or responding to our communications,
you consent to us transferring any such data in this way. However any company,
whether inside or outside the EEA, to whom we transfer data is contractually
bound to protect your Personal Data.</p>

<p>Hearst Magazines UK and
affiliates are committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data. We
use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help
protect your Personal Data from unauthorised
access, use, or disclosure. </p>

<p>On our sites, when collecting
your credit card information for online purchases, Hearst Magazines UK enables
the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology and industry-standard
secured-server transactions that encrypt your Personal Data. To verify that you
have a secure server connection, look for the locked padlock symbol at the
bottom of your browser window or the HTTPS-prefix in the URL.</p>

<p>Hearst Magazines UK has
implemented other industry-standard electronic means of protecting your
Personal Data. We store Personal Data behind a firewall, a barrier designed to
prevent outsiders from accessing our servers. We may also require you to enter
a password to access or update your account information. In addition, Hearst
Magazines UK protects your Personal Data from
unauthorised physical access by storing your Personal Data in a controlled
facility. </p>

<p>Except as provided elsewhere in
this Privacy Policy, Hearst Magazines UK limits access to Personal Data in
electronic databases to those persons (including employees and contractors) in Hearst
Magazines UK's organisation who have a business need for such access and those
persons are under contract to keep your data secure.</p>

<p>Even though Hearst Magazines UK
has taken significant steps to ensure that your Personal Data is not
intercepted, accessed, used, or disclosed by unauthorised persons, you should
know that Hearst Magazines UK cannot eliminate security risks associated with Personal
Data.</p>

information held about you and you may ask us to make any necessary changes to
ensure that it is accurate and kept up to date. If you wish to see the

<br>
We collect Personal Data from you, such as your name, contact details, country

register on one of our sites or when you choose to use the various services we
provide on our sites. We also collect other types of Personal Data that you

<br>
Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy and in our Privacy Notices
where you give us your consent, we do not sell, trade, or rent the Personal

e-mails. These third parties are required under contract not to use your
Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by Hearst - Rodale Ltd
