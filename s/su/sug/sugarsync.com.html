    	<h1>SUGARSYNC PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
          <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by SugarSync, Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies (collectively, SugarSync's "services"). This Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use personal information related to our services. We hope that this will help you to make informed decisions when using our services. In this Privacy Policy, references to "we," "our" and "us" refer to SugarSync, while "you" and "your" refer to the SugarSync customer or user.</p>
          <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to email us at <a class="secondary" href="mailto:support@sugarsync.com">support@sugarsync.com</a> or write to us at Privacy Concerns, c/o<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/company_full_contact.lbi" -->SugarSync, Inc., 2121 S El Camino Real, 6th Floor, San Mateo, CA 94403<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->.</p>
          <h5>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h5>
          <p>In order to provide our services, we collect the following types of information:</p>
          <h6>Registration Information</h6>
          <p>When you register with SugarSync in order to create an account, we ask you to provide us with personal information including your name, email address, account password, mailing address and phone number; and depending upon the type of account you create, we may also ask you for billing information and information about your computers and devices used by you to use and access the services. Gender and age information may also be provided optionally. When you register, we also subscribe you to our mailing list. You may opt-out/unsubscribe at any time by sending us an email at <a class="secondary" href="mailto:support@sugarsync.com">support@sugarsync.com</a>.</p>
          <p>In order to use the SugarSync services you must be at least thirteen (13) years of age. As children under the age of 13 are not allowed to use the SugarSync services, this Privacy Policy makes no provision for their use. In the event that a user identifies himself or herself as a child under the age of 13 within the SugarSync website at www.sugarsync.com (the “website”), SugarSync will not collect, store or use any personal information of such user. Further, in the event that SugarSync receives personal information that SugarSync discovers was provided by a child under the age of 13, SugarSync will promptly delete such personal information in a secure manner.</p>
          <h6>User Communication</h6>
          <p>If you send us email or other communications, we may retain the content of your communications together with your email address and our responses.</p>
          <h6>Files</h6>
          <p>If you choose to use our services, we may store your electronic files on our servers. Files are encrypted on the SugarSync servers and are encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption during transmission. If you utilize Web-based access to your files, you must be sure to properly log off your Internet session to prevent access to your files by someone using the same computer. Your files may be stored for up to 90 days after you have deleted them from your account or after your account has been terminated.</p>
          <h6>Third Party Information that You Provide</h6>
          <p>If you want to share files that are stored on your account with others, you will need to provide email addresses or other contact information for such persons. We will use the information you provide only to enable such persons to view the shared files and to use our services. We will not use this information for any other purpose.  Please note that SugarSync may prevent the sharing of certain types of files, depending upon what services you are using.</p>
          <h6>Website Use Information</h6>
          <p>Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" and web server logs to collect information about how our website is used. A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. When you log onto and browse our website, our website server automatically receives and records information on our website server logs from your browser, which may include your IP address, cookie, page(s) viewed, the date and time of visits, time spent at our website, and websites visited just before and just after our website.</p>
          <h5>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION</h5>
          <p>We use information which we collect for purposes of providing the services, auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services, ensuring the functioning of our servers, providing customer service and developing new products and services for our customers and prospective customers. We may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our services and special offers which we think you may find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers by sending an email to <a class="secondary" href="mailto:support@sugarsync.com">support@sugarsync.com</a>. Please keep in mind that by using our services, we may need to send you information regarding your account, such as service announcements, so by your use of our services, you authorize us to send you such information.</p>
          <p>Our website uses cookies to differentiate you from other users and to improve your user experience (for example, by enabling you to log in fewer times than would otherwise be required). In addition, cookies, in conjunction with our server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our website and which parts of the site are more popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve our website and better serve our customers.</p>
          <h6>Sharing Information with Third Parties</h6>
          <p>We do not share your files stored on our servers with any third parties unless instructed by you and allowed by SugarSync.  We will not disclose your files to anyone unless compelled to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction. Your files are not considered "personal information."</p>
          <p>SugarSync does not sell or rent your personal information to third parties except that your personal information may be disclosed to third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
          <ul class="alt default2">
            <li>We may disclose your personal information to our affiliates and subsidiaries.</li>
            <li>We may disclose your personal information to third parties if you consent.</li>
            <li>We may use third parties to perform services related to our operations (such as processing personal information on our behalf). In connection with these business operations, third parties may have access to your personal information. These third parties will be subject to an agreement to treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, we will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these third parties.</li>
            <li>If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or any form of sale of some or all of our assets, we will provide notice by email before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
            <li>We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the law or comply with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights and property, our services and/or users of our services; (c) enforce the terms of use with respect to our services (including investigation of potential violations thereof); (d) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (e) protect the safety of users of the services, us or third parties.</li>
            <li>We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the average number of photographs being stored by users. Such information does not identify you individually.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>SECURITY: UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION</h5>
          <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. Within SugarSync, we restrict access to personal information to SugarSync employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These persons are bound by confidentiality obligations.</p>
          <h6>Email Transmissions</h6>
          <p>Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this reason, we request that you do not send private information to us by email. Some of the personal information you may enter on our website (e.g., login, reset password, etc.) will be transmitted securely via Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) server, which encrypts such information.</p>
          <h6>Links to External Sites</h6>
          <p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our website nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other websites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our website.</p>
          <p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our website to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>
          <h6>How to Access and Correct Your Information</h6>
          <p>You may access and correct your information at any time by logging into your account and changing the necessary information. If you cancel your SugarSync account, your identification, billing and contact information may remain in our records for some period of time.</p>
          <h5>YOUR CONSENT</h5>
          <p>By using our services you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy without notice from time to time. We will post any changes on this page. Your continued use of the SugarSync services indicates your agreement to any modified terms in the Privacy Policy.</p>
