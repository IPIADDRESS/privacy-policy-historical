<p>The type of information we collect from you depends upon the type of interactions you have with our websites and Services, including the context of your interactions with SugarCRM, the choices you make (including privacy settings) as well as the Services you use.</p>

<p>You may choose to give us personal information directly in a variety of situations, such as if you request to receive information or a service from SugarCRM, if you apply for a job via our job application portal, or if you do business with us as a supplier or partner.</p>

<p>We may also collect information relating to your use of our websites and our Services through the use of various technologies. For example, when you visit our websites, we may log certain information that your browser sends, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access time, and referring web site addresses. We may collect information about the pages you view within our websites and other actions you take while visiting us. In addition, some of our Services include technologies that allow us to collect certain information about product use.</p>

<p>We may also collect information that pertains to you indirectly through other sources, such as vendors. When we do so, we ask the vendors to confirm that the information was legally acquired and that we have the right to obtain it from them and use it.</p>

<p>Further details can be found in <a href="#II">Section II</a>.</p>

<h3 class="no-underline">How we use your personal data</h3>

<h3 class="no-underline">Why you are required to provide personal data</h3>

<p>In general, your provision of any personal data or granting of consent to a processing activity is entirely voluntary. However, there are certain circumstances in which SugarCRM cannot take action without processing certain personal data, for example to process your orders, or to assist you with use of our Services, or to provide access to a web offering or newsletter. In these cases, it will not be possible for SugarCRM to provide what you request without the relevant personal information. In some circumstances, SugarCRM may need to terminate your ability to use the Services without access to your personal data. SugarCRM intends to notify you of whether such communication or data sharing is deemed mandatory and the impact of not sharing.</p>

<h3 class="no-underline">Sharing of your personal data</h3>

<p>SugarCRM is a global organisation with business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders. As such, we may share data about you with other SugarCRM entities and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business in connection with the uses identified in this Privacy Policy. Our procedures are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for personal information by all SugarCRM entities.</p>

<p>In some cases we use suppliers located in various countries to collect, use, analyse, and otherwise process information on our behalf. We may also use subcontractors which provide services to us in connection with providing our Services to you. We put in place contractual safeguards for the protection of your personal data with such suppliers, including obligations for processing in line with applicable legal requirements.</p>

<p>We may also disclose your personal information to other business partners. Unless otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy, we will only do so with your consent. We do not in any event sell or lease any of your personal information.</p>

<p>Where you post information to our wikis, forums, blogs, message boards, chat rooms, websites or other social networking environments, your information will be shared with audiences within those platforms.</p>

<p>We may share your personal data based on a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person. We may use your personal data as evidence in litigation in which we are involved, to protect the rights or safety of any person or entity, to respond to a judicial process or valid government inquiry or as otherwise required by law.</p>

<h3 class="no-underline">Where we process personal data</h3>

<p>If you choose to provide us with information, including personal data, you understand that we are storing this and/or transferring it to SugarCRM's locations and systems in the United States or to the locations and systems of SugarCRM's affiliates or service providers around the world. SugarCRM complies with applicable law when transferring your personal information outside of the country there the information is collected. For data originating from a European Union member state, SugarCRM uses a variety of data transfer mechanisms (including standard contractual clauses) for this purpose.</p>

<p>SugarCRM has also certified under the EU- U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield address the collection, protection, storage, transfer, use and other processing of data transferred from the European Economic Area and Switzerland to the United States. To learn more about SugarCRM's certification, please visit the Privacy Shield website <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TNjnAAG">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TNjnAAG</a> and refer to our&nbsp;Privacy Shield Notice.</p>

<h3 class="no-underline">How long we retain your personal data</h3>

<p>The duration of processing of your personal data depends on the legal basis for the processing.</p>

<p>SugarCRM's policy is to retain personal data no longer than (a) is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the personal data is processed, (b) if processing is based on consent, until you withdraw your consent, or (c) if processing is based on a legitimate interest of SugarCRM, until you object to such processing.</p>

<p>However, we will store personal data for a longer period where (a) we are required by law to retain your personal data or (b) your personal data is required for SugarCRM to assert or defend against legal claims. In this event, we will retain your personal data until the end of the relevant retention period or until the claims in question have been settled. If you require more details with respect to the retention periods, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dataprivacy@sugarcrm.com">dataprivacy@sugarcrm.com</a>.</p>

<h3 class="no-underline">Your rights as a data subject</h3>

<p>You can contact us directly (as set forth below) to update your personal data.</p>

<p><i>Access, correction, deletion of personal data</i>: You can request at any time the personal data SugarCRM holds about you and the correction or deletion of such personal data. SugarCRM can only delete your personal data if there is no statutory obligation or prevailing right of SugarCRM to retain it. In addition, if you request deletion of your personal data you will not be able to continue to use any SugarCRM Services that require the use of your personal data.</p>

<p><i>Request personal data in a portable format</i>: If SugarCRM uses your personal data based on your consent or to perform a contract with you, you may further request from SugarCRM a copy of the personal data in a portable format that you have provided to SugarCRM and where processing is carried out by automated means.</p>

<p><i>Restriction of processing and right to object</i>: You can also request that SugarCRM restrict (without deleting) further processing of your personal data: (i) if you state that your personal data is incorrect, for as long as we need to verify the accuracy of the personal data, (ii) if there is no legal basis for SugarCRM to process your personal data and you demand that SugarCRM restricts your personal data from further processing instead of deleting it, (iii) if SugarCRM no longer needs your personal data but you as data subject claim that you require SugarCRM to retain such data in order to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, or (iv) where SugarCRM processes your personal data on the basis of its legitimate interest as further detailed in <a href="#II">Section II</a> and you object to the processing of your personal data for as long as it is required to review whether SugarCRM has a prevailing interest or legal obligation to process your personal data.</p>

<p>Please send any such requests to <a href="mailto:dataprivacy@sugarcrm.com">dataprivacy@sugarcrm.com</a>.</p>

<h3 class="no-underline">Right to lodge a complaint</h3>

<p>If you believe that SugarCRM is not processing your personal data in accordance with the requirements set out herein or applicable data protection laws, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority.</p>

<h3 class="no-underline">Use of this website by children</h3>

<p>SugarCRM recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. SugarCRM's websites are not intended for children under the age of 16 and SugarCRM does not target our websites to children under 16. Also, SugarCRM's policy is to not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 16.</p>

SugarCRM and its Services are subject to the export laws of various countries including, without limitation, those of the European Union and its member states, and of the United States of America. You acknowledge that, pursuant to the applicable export laws, trade sanctions, and embargoes issued by these countries, SugarCRM is required to take measures to prevent entities, organizations, and parties listed on government-issued sanctioned-party lists from accessing certain products, technologies, and services through SugarCRM's websites or other delivery channels controlled by SugarCRM. SugarCRM's compliance may include (i) automated checks of any user registration data as set out herein and other information a user provides about his or her identity against applicable sanctioned-party lists; (ii) regular repetition of such checks whenever a sanctioned-party list is updated or when a user updates his or her information; (iii) blocking of access to SugarCRM's Services in case of a potential match; and (iv) contacting a user to confirm his or her identity in case of a potential match.</p>

<p><i>General Business Relationship Communications</i>. SugarCRM communicates on a regular basis by email with users of our Services. For resolving partner, customer or user complaints or enquire into suspicious transactions we may also communicate by phone.</p>

<p>Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications, which are not marketing-related but required for the relevant business relationship. With regard to marketing-related communication by phone or e-mail, SugarCRM will (i) if legally required, only provide you with such communications after you have opted in, and (ii) provide you the opportunity to opt out if you do not want to receive further marketing-related types of communication from us. You can opt out of these at any time at <a href="https://info.sugarcrm.com/email-preference-center">Preference Center</a>.</p>
