We may also process and use your personal data to ensure the functionality and security of our products and services, to identify you, and to prevent and detect fraud and other misuses.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development of products and services.</span> We may process and use your personal data to develop our products and/or services. However, for the most part we only use aggregate and statistical information in the development of our products and services, and not data directly identifiable to you. We may also process and use your personal data to personalize our offerings and to provide you with service more relevant to you, for example, to make recommendations and to display customized content and advertising. We may combine personal data collected in connection with your use of a particular Amer Sports product and/or service with other personal data we may hold about you, except where such personal data was collected for a different purpose.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Communicating with you and marketing.</span> We may process and use your personal data to communicate with you, for example, to provide information relating to our products and/or services you are using or to contact you for customer satisfaction queries. We may process and use your personal data for marketing. Marketing purposes may include using your personal data for personalized marketing or research purposes in accordance with applicable laws, for example, to conduct market research and to communicate our&nbsp; products, services or promotions to you via our own or third parties’ electronic or other services.</p> <p>In addition, some of our products and services may be used to promote products and services of other companies. However, Amer Sports does not disclose your personal data to such companies for their marketing purposes without your prior consent.&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Profiling/personalization.</span> We may process and use your personal data for profiling/personalization for such purposes as targeted direct marketing and improvement of our products or services. We may also create aggregate and statistical information based on your personal data. Profiling/personalization includes automated processing of your personal data for evaluating, analyzing or predicting your personal preferences or interests in order to, for example, send you marketing messages concerning products or services best suitable for you.&nbsp;</p> <h5>TRANSFERS OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h5> <p>We may disclose your personal data to third parties solely as stated below in this Policy, or as obligated by mandatory law.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amer Sports group companies.</span> You acknowledge and agree that we may share your personal data within Amer Sports group companies, and may transfer your personal data for the use of other Amer Sports group companies for the purposes set forth in this Policy, when a group company/group companies are involved in the provision of the services to you or to other group companies. This may include, for example billing and delivery of your purchases, provision of services such as customer service, development and maintenance of digital solutions and managing, analyzing and profiling/personalization of customer data as set forth above. &nbsp;Other group companies/brands of Amer Sports, than the one you have separately subscribed to as a consumer, will not send you e-mail or text message based marketing.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opting-out from e-mail/SMS based marketing.</span> You may opt-out from brand marketing e-mails by following the guidance in those e-mails (typically provided via “unsubscribe” link) or by contacting the respective brand/group company as set forth in the e-mail and in their web site. If you opt-out, we may still send you non-marketing e-mails, such as service notifications or other information or if you are a business customer, we may send business relation information. You may also opt-out from any SMS based direct marketing by contacting the respective group company/brand as set forth in their site or via SMS as may be applicable.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service providers and other authorized third parties</span>. We may transfer your personal data to authorized third parties who process personal data on behalf of Amer Sports for the purposes described in this Policy, such as e.g., technical, logistics, e-commerce, marketing and other service providers.&nbsp; Such parties are not permitted to use your personal data for any other purposes than for what your personal data was collected, and we require them to act consistently with applicable laws and this Policy as well as to use appropriate security measures to protect your personal data.</p> <p>We may also transfer your personal data, including heart rate data, biometrical data or other health related data, to a service partner, if you use such services where a third party company needs to process such data for the provision of the respective service or where you separately agree that a third party company may process your data in connection with the services or products of Amer Sports.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">International transfers.</span> Our products and services may be provided using resources and servers located in various countries around the world. Therefore your personal data may be transferred outside the country where you use our services, including to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), where the level of data protection may not be deemed adequate by the European Commission. In such cases we take steps to ensure that adequate protection for your personal data is provided as required by applicable laws. For international transfers of your personal data, we generally rely on agreements that are based on the Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) of the European Commission. You may find the SCCs <a title="Standard Contractual Clauses" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en" target="_blank">here</a>. If you wish to know more about international transfers of your personal data, you may contact us via the contact details given below.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other disclosures.</span> We may disclose and otherwise process your personal data in accordance with applicable laws to defend Amer Sports’ legitimate interests, for example, in civil or criminal legal proceedings.&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mergers and Acquisitions.</span> If we decide to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize our businesses in certain countries, this may involve us disclosing personal data to prospective or actual purchasers and their advisers, or receiving personal data from sellers and their advisers, for the purposes of such transactions.</p> <h5>DATA CONCERNING MINORS</h5> <p>Amer Sports does not seek to collect any information from or engage in any transactions with persons under the legal age in their respective country.&nbsp; Our databases may nevertheless contain personal data of children due to the fact that it is not always possible to determine precisely the age of the user. We reserve the right to block the service from any person who is or whom we reasonably suspect of being a minor.&nbsp;</p> <p>Amer Sports’ policy is to request that minors do not make purchases or engage in other legal acts on our products and services without the consent of a parent or legal guardian, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law. If you are a minor but have your legal guardian’s consent, you must be able to prove that such consent exists upon request.</p> <h5>DATA QUALITY AND RETENTION</h5> <p>We take reasonable steps to keep the personal data we possess accurate and up-to-date and to delete out of date or otherwise incorrect or unnecessary personal data.</p> <p>Certain Amer Sports products and services may allow you to manage your profile and the information in such profile. We encourage you to access your personal data via your profile from time to time to ensure that it is correct and up-to-date. Please remember that for such electronic services where you may manage your profile, it is your responsibility to provide us with correct details as well as to update the personal data you have provided us with in case of any changes.</p> <p>We store your personal data only for a period necessary for the purpose in question or as long as required by applicable laws.&nbsp;</p> <h5>DATA SECURITY</h5> <p>Amer Sports implements appropriate technical and organizational security measures to prevent and minimize risks associated with providing and processing personal data.&nbsp;</p> <p>Such security measures include, where appropriate, the use of firewalls, secure server facilities, encryption, implementing proper access rights management systems and processes, careful selection of processors, sufficient training of Amer Sports’ personnel involved in the processing, and other necessary measures to provide appropriate protection for your personal data against unauthorized use or disclosure. Where appropriate, we may also take back-up copies and use other such means to prevent accidental damage or destruction of your personal data. If a particular part of an Amer Sports website supports on-line transactions, we will use an industry standard security measure, such as the one available through “Secure Sockets Layer” (“SSL”), to protect the confidentiality and security of online transactions.</p> <h5>USE OF COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS</h5> <p>From time to time when you visit an Amer Sports website, information may be placed on your computer to allow us to recognize your computer in the form of a text file known as a “cookie”. Our use of cookies is intended to provide benefits to you, such as eliminating the need for you to enter your password frequently during a session or the need to re-enter items you place in a shopping cart if you do not finish a transaction in a single visit. Cookies are also used for website traffic analysis and profiling.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some of the Amer Sports websites may also use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. You may prevent Flash cookies from being stored by following the instructions provided by Adobe at <a title="Instructions for preventing Flash cookies" href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html" target="_blank">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html</a>.</p> <p>Amer Sports may use so called web beacons (or “pixel tags”) in connection with some websites. However, we do not use them to identify individual users personally. Web beacons are typically graphic images that are placed on a website and they are used to count visitors to a website and/or to access certain cookies. This information is used to improve our services. Web beacons do not typically collect any other information than what your browser provides us with as a standard part of any internet communication. If you turn off cookies, the web beacon will no longer be able to track your specific activity. The web beacon may, however, continue to collect information of visits from your IP-address, but such information will no longer be personally identifiable.</p> <p>If you wish to disable cookies, or want to be notified before they are placed, you may do this in your browser settings. For example, if you are using Internet Explorer, you may disable and manage cookies by following the instructions&nbsp;<a title="Instructions for disabling and managing cookies" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies" target="_blank">here</a>. Further information about controlling of cookies can be found from:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options" target="_blank">https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options</a>.</p> <p>However, we may not be able to provide certain services or you may not be able to view certain parts of this site if you have disabled cookies.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some of our business partners whose content is linked to or from our website may also use cookies or web beacons. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.</p> <p>You acknowledge and agree to the storage of cookies, other local storage technologies, beacons and other information on your devices and to the access of such cookies, local storage technologies, beacons and information by us and by the third parties mentioned above.</p> <h5>YOUR RIGHTS</h5> <p>You have the right to request information and access to the personal data we have collected from and of you. You also have the right to request that we replenish, rectify, anonymize or delete any incomplete, incorrect, unnecessary or outdated personal data we hold on you. However, we cannot delete such personal data that is necessary for compliance with binding legal obligations or if the personal data must be retained according to applicable laws. You have the right to request and receive the personal data we have collected on you in a commonly used and machine-readable form. In case you consider your personal data collected by us to be inaccurate, you do not wish your personal data to be deleted where the processing of your personal data has been deemed unlawful or the personal data is no longer necessary, or you have objected to the processing and the existence of legitimate grounds for processing is still under consideration, you may request restriction of processing of your personal data.&nbsp;</p> <p>You may also at any time object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing purposes, sending promotional materials, profiling, or for the performance of market research. Further, where your personal data is processed based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent for such processing at any time.</p> <p>In case you wish to make use of your rights mentioned above, you may, as appropriate and in accordance with applicable laws, exercise such rights by contacting us through the contact points referred in the marketing materials or below in this Policy. In some cases, especially if you wish us to delete or cease the processing of your personal data, this may also mean that we may not be able to continue to provide the services to you. We encourage you to use available profile management tools for the above purposes as such tools often provide you with direct access to your personal data and allow you to effectively manage it.</p> <p>Please note that Amer Sports may need to identify you and to ask for additional information in order to be able to fulfill your above requests. Please also note that applicable law may contain restrictions and other provisions that relate to your above rights.</p> <h5>COMPLAINT TO THE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY</h5> <p>In the event you consider Amer Sports’ processing activities of your personal data to be inconsistent with the applicable data protection laws or that Amer Sports has not sufficiently ensured the realization of your rights, you may lodge a complaint with the local supervisory authority responsible for data protection matters.&nbsp;</p> <h5>THE CONTROLLER OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND CONTACT DETAILS</h5> <p>The data controllers responsible for the purposes of the applicable data protection laws are, as applicable:</p> <p>1) Amer Sports Corporation<br>Konepajankuja 6<br>00511 Helsinki<br>Finland</p> <p>and/or</p> <p>2) The Amer Sports group company, whose webpage, application, product or service you are using (name and registered address available during the purchase or registration process)</p> <p>and/or, as applicable,</p> <p>3) The Amer Sports group company which uses your personal data for its direct marketing or similar purposes (name and registered address available in the marketing material received by you).</p> <p>You may contact the above mentioned data controllers as set forth in their respective sites or at the following address:</p> <p>Amer Sports Corporation<br>c/o Legal<br>Konepajankuja 6<br>00510 Helsinki<br>Finland</p> <h5>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h5> <p>Amer Sports may from time to time update and change this Privacy Policy. If the changes include new purposes of processing, Amer Sports will give you prior notice of such changes and, where necessary, request your consent.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
