                  may also provide information when you participate in sweepstakes
                  and contests, voting and polling activities, message boards
                  and chat rooms and other interactive areas of our site. </span></p>
                <p class="entList"> Like most Web sites, SunJournal.com
                    also collects information automatically and through the use
                    of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors.
                    For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service
                    Provider or use "cookie" technology.
                  Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and
                  password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information
                  each time you visit, or may control the number of times you
                  encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site.
                  As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information
                  through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to
                  provide us with information, for example by setting your browser
                  to refuse to accept cookies, but doing so may limit your ability
                  to access certain portions of the site or may require you to
                  re-enter your user name and password. Additionally we may not
                  be able to customize the site's features according to your
                  preferences. </p>
                <p class="entHead"><strong> V. What we do with the information we collect </strong></p>
                <p> <span class="entList">We will use your information only as permitted by law. Aggregated
                  Information (information that does not personally identify
                  you) may be used in many ways. As one example, we may combine
                  information about your usage patterns with similar information
                  obtained from other users to learn which pages are visited
                  most or what features are most attractive. Aggregated Information
                  may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business
                  partners, but cannot be used to contact you individually. </span></p>
                <p class="entList"> We also collect information to enhance
                    your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising.
                    For example, we may use Personally Identifiable Information
                    collected on SunJournal.com to communicate with you regarding
                    our Terms of Service and privacy policy, products and services

                    administration of sweepstakes and contests, processing e-commerce
                    transactions and other topics we think you might find of
                    interest. We reserve the right to share this information
                    with other business units and affiliates, including for example
                    our affiliated newspapers and entities which has an ownership
                    interest (collectively, "Affiliates").
                  This policy does not apply to any Affiliate's use of such information. </p>

                  a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably
                  required to do so by law, in connection with the collection
                  of amounts you may owe to us, and/or whenever we deem it appropriate
                  or necessary to give such information to law enforcement authorities.
