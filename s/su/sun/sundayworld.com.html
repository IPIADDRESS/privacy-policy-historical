<li>Subject to the above, your rights under Data Protection Legislation may include (as relevant):</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Your Right: Right of Access</strong></p>
<p>What does it mean? Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled to have access to your personal data which we hold (this is more commonly known as submitting a “data subject access request”).<br>
How do I execute this right? Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email <a href="mailto:data.protection@inmplc.com">data.protection@inmplc.com</a> and/or by post to INM
Data Controller, INM, 27-32 Talbot St, Dublin 1, Ireland. If possible, you should specify the type of information you would like to see to ensure that our disclosure is meeting your expectations.<br>
Conditions to exercise? We must be able to verify your identity. Your request may not affect the rights and freedoms of others, e.g. privacy and confidentiality rights of other individuals and/or businesses.</p>

<p><strong>Your Right: Right of Data Portability</strong></p>
<p>What does it mean? Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled to receive the data which you have provided to us and which is processed by us by automated means, in a commonly-used machine readable format.<br>
How do I execute this right? Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email <a href="mailto:data.protection@inmplc.com">data.protection@inmplc.com</a> and/or by post to INM
Data Controller, INM, 27-32 Talbot St, Dublin 1, Ireland. If possible, you should specify the type of information you would like to see to ensure that our disclosure is meeting your expectations.<br>
Conditions to exercise? The GDPR does not establish a general right to data portability. This right only applies if the processing is based on your consent or on our contract with you and when the processing is carried out by automated means (e.g. not for paper records). It affects only personal data that was “provided” by you. Therefore, it does not, as a rule, apply to personal data that was created by the INM or supplied to the INM by any other individual and/or business.</p>

<p><strong>Your Right: Rights in relation to inaccurate personal or incomplete data</strong></p>
<p>What does it mean? You may challenge the accuracy or completeness of personal data which we process about you. If it is found that personal data is inaccurate, you are entitled to have the inaccurate data removed, corrected or completed, as appropriate.<br>
How do I execute this right? We encourage you to notify us of any changes regarding your personal data as soon as they occur, including changes to your contact details. Please always check first whether self-help tools are available. Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email <a href="mailto:data.protection@inmplc.com">data.protection@inmplc.com</a> and/or by post to INM Data Controller, INM, 27-32 Talbot St, Dublin 1, Ireland.<br>
Conditions to exercise? This right only applies to your own personal data. When exercising this right, please be as specific as possible.</p>
