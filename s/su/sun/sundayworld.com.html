        <p>Sunday Newspapers Ltd and its associated companies fully respect your right to privacy.</p>

        <p><strong>Identity</strong></p>

        <p>This Privacy and Cookie Policy applies to the operations of this website operated by Sunday Newspapers Limited.</p>

        <p>Data Protection: What information do we collect?</p>

        <p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful content to help improve your online experience.<br>
        We collect certain kinds of information about our users for these reasons:</p>

        <ol>
        	<li>To provide personalised services unique to individual users.</li>
        	<li>To help us to monitor and improve the services we offer.</li>
        	<li>To sell advertising space on the site.</li>
        	<li>With user consent, to market services to individual users.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Visitors should be aware that each time they visit a website two general levels of information about their visit can be retained. The first level comprises statistical and other analytical information collected on an aggregate and non-individual specific basis of all browsers who visit the site, and the second is information that is personal or particular to a specific visitor who knowingly chooses to provide that information.</p>

        <p>It is policy of this website to respect and protect the privacy of our Customers and never wilfully disclose individually identifiable information about its Customers to any third party without first receiving that Customer's permission.</p>

        <p>We may, however, occasionally email you with information or queries about your registration or accounts, for instance to request permissions or advise you of changes.</p>

        <p>No personally identifiable information is collected about you on this website, apart from information which you volunteer (for example by emailing us, using our online forms, entering a competition or by making an inquiry about content or services).</p>

        <p>Throughout this website you may have an opportunity to send us information relating to you such as through the "contact us" pages or any other area where you may send e-mails, request brochures, enter contests or respond to any promotions.</p>

        <p>By choosing to participate in these, you will be providing us with some level of personal information relating to you which can be used by Sunday Newspapers Ltd or our parent company Independent Newspapers Ltd.</p>

        <p>This information will only be used by Sunday Newspapers or Independent Newspapers (Ireland) Limited for:<br>
        the purposes for which it was provided by you;</p>

        <ul>
        	<li>verification purposes and statistical analysis;</li>
        	<li>to provide you with details of products, services, contests, competitions or promotions being provided or run by Sunday Newspapers Ltd or Independent Newspapers Ltd or any of its associated companies or any third party that we may select and which we may think would be of interest to you, in line with your request to receive this information.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What are Cookies</strong></p>

        <p>Cookies are small pieces of information, stored in simple text files, placed on your computer by a website. Cookies can be read by the website on your subsequent visits. The information stored in a cookie may relate to your browsing habits on the web page, or a unique identification number so that the website can ‘remember’ you on your return visit.</p>

        <p>Generally speaking, cookies do not contain personal information from which you can be identified, unless you have furnished such information to the website. This website uses cookies to track usage and help improve features and services of the site.</p>

        <p>Statistical and analytical information from cookies provides us with general and not individually specific information about the number of people who visit this website; the number of people who return to this site; the pages that they visit; where they were before they came to this site and the page in the site at which they exited. This information helps us monitor traffic on our website so that we can manage the site's capacity and efficiency. It also helps us to understand which parts of this site are most popular, and generally to assess user behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site.</p>

        <p><strong>How we use Cookies</strong></p>

        <p>We collect information on our users through registration and the use of the website, through cookies, where you choose to disclose data in postings, and when you enter sales promotion and competitions.</p>

        <p>We use cookies for a number of reasons:</p>

        <ol>
        	<li>To gather statistics. We track how many 'unique users' we have and how often they visit our websites. We track how often different pages of our website are visited and which countries our visitors come from. Accurate statistics enable us to sell advertising and continue to provide a top quality service to you.</li>
        	<li>To track advertising response Sunday Newspapers Ltd and its associated companies and third party advertisers generate statistical cookies to track ad impressions and click-through rates</li>
        	<li>Some cookies enable us to show you adverts that you might be more relevant to you, to control the number of times you see them, and measure how effective the ad campaign has been.</li>
        	<li>Flash cookies may be used to store user preferences for media player functionality and without them some video content may not render correctly.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>By using the sites you are agreeing to the use of cookies as described.</p>

        <p><strong>Cookies we use</strong></p>

These cookies can tell us whether or not you have visited the site before. Your browser will tell us if you have these cookies, and if you don't, we generate new ones. This allows us to track how many individual unique users we have, and how often they visit the site. Unless you are signed in to Sunday Newspapers Ltd site, these cookies cannot be used to identify individuals; they are used for statistical purposes only. If you are logged in, we will also know the details you gave to us for this, such as username and email address.</p>
