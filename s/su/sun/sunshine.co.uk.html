                    <p><strong>What kind of personal information do we collect?</strong></p>

                    <p>When you book a holiday with us, you will be required to provide us with certain information, including
                    your name, address, e-mail address and phone number and payment information.</p>

                    <p>If you fill in a booking form but don’t actually complete the booking, we will use your information
                    (which we will have collected using cookies) to check in with you as to whether you need any assistance
                    and whether you would like to complete your booking. For more information about how we do this (and how
                    to prevent this if you wish to do so), please see our Cookie Statement at
                    <a href="“http://www.sunshine.co.uk/cookie-information.html”">www.sunshine.co.uk/cookie-information.html</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Personal Information you give to us about others</strong></p>

                    <p>If you are travelling with others or booking a holiday for someone else, you will need to give us personal

                    ensure that anyone who you have provided personal information about is aware that you have done so and accept
                    how we use and process their information.</p>

                    internet browser you use and information about your visit, including pages you viewed and interaction
                    information.</p>

                    <p>If you are using a mobile device, we may collect data that identifies your mobile device, location
                    details and any specific settings.</p>

                    <p>For more information, please see our Cookie Statement
                    <a href="“http://www.sunshine.co.uk/cookie-information.html”">www.sunshine.co.uk/cookie-information.html</a>.</p>


                    <p><strong>Personal Information that we receive from others</strong></p>

                    <p>We may also receive information about you from your travel agent for the purpose of carrying out a
                    booking you have made with that agent. In that circumstance, we will only use your personal data to carry
                    out that booking unless we have your permission to do otherwise.</p>

                    <p><strong>What do we do with your personal data?</strong></p>

                    <p>Once we have collected the information about you, it will be used for the following purposes:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bookings</strong>. Put simply, we will use your personal data to provide to you the
                        services that we sell, which may include flights, hotels, transport, insurance and other ancillary
                        products. We need certain information about you, so we can fulfil our obligations contained in the
                        contract that you enter into with us when you make a booking.</li>

                        <li><strong>User Accounts: </strong>The information that you provide when you set up an account
                        on our website or app allows us to provide you with services including the ability to manage your
                        bookings, personal settings and access to special offers.</li>

                        <li><strong>To communicate with you in relation to your holiday:</strong> We will use the contact
                        information you have previously shared with us to communicate with you in relation to your holiday
                        and to provide you with information relevant to your holiday.  For example, helpful information
                        about the destination to which you are travelling, security alerts, administrative messages about
                        your holiday and emails to remind you to fill in your Holiday Checklist.</li>

                        <li><strong>Customer Services: </strong>You are free to contact us about our services at any time,
                        whether this is a general query, a question about your booking or to report a problem on our website.
                        This can be done through the Manage Your Booking system on our Website or app, by telephone or via
                        social media. We will use the information that you have provided to help us answer any questions and
                        respond to your query (along with any future queries that you may have). If you contact us by
                        telephone, your call may be recorded for quality control and training purposes but we will always
                        ask for your consent before recording communications for these purposes.</li>

                        <li><strong>Personalisation:</strong> We will use information we hold about you, such as the products
                        and services you have purchased from us in the past, to enable us to show you the products and
                        services we think you will like on our website and app and communicate these with you, such as
                        the recommended deals and special offers we put to you. For example, we will save your searches
                        in order to tailor future searches you make to your needs. If you would like to turn off this
                        functionality you can do so via your account.</li>

                        <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Where you place an order with us and you have not opted out (or in
                        any other case, if you have opted in to receive marketing by e-mail or text message), we may contact
                        you by e-mail or text message with information about other goods and services that we offer that are
                        similar to those that you have already purchased or enquired about and we think may interest you based
                        on the information we hold about you. We may also use your contact details to contact you by phone or
                        post with details of products and services that we think may be of interest to you (unless you have
                        told us you don't want to receive these communications or you are registered with the Telephone
                        Preference Service). </li>

                        <li><strong>Promotional Activities:</strong> If you participate in our promotions (such as surveys
                        or competitions) we will use the information you provide to administer these activities</li>

                        <li><strong>Improving our services: </strong>Sometimes we will use your data to help us improve the
                        quality and functionality of the services that we offer. This includes:

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Legal basis for processing personal data</strong></p>

                    <p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data described above will depend on the
                    personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>

                    <p>However, we will normally collect personal data from you under the following legal bases:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> If we have obligations under a contract with you,
                        we will use your information to perform our obligations to you. For example, if you make an online
                        booking on our Website or app, we will use the information that you provide us with when making
                        the booking to complete and administer the reservations with the relevant third party suppliers. </li>

                        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> You will be asked to consent to us providing you with marketing
                        information and if you give us this consent, we will rely on this when contacting you with marketing
                        information by e-mail and text message (although please note that in limited circumstances we
                        are allowed to send marketing information to you without your consent). You can opt-out of
                        receiving marketing communications from us at anytime by contacting us using the details at the
                        end of this policy, by using the link at the bottom of each email that we send to you or by logging
                        in to your account and changing your contact preferences.</li>

                        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> We will use your information for our own legitimate
                        interests, for example, to provide you with the best suitable content on our Website or app, to
                        improve and promote our services and for our own administrative purposes including creating and
                        maintaining business records of our relationship with you.</li>

                        <li><strong>Legal requirement/vital interests:</strong> In some cases, we will have a legal obligation
                        to collect personal data from you (for example, for us to comply with tax laws which require us to
                        collect and retain records of products and services that we sell) or where we need the personal data
                        to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for example, if you are involved in an
                        emergency and we need to provide the details which we hold about you to the emergency services).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>How and where will your data be processed?</strong></p>

                    <p>Any information that we hold about you is stored on our secure servers and all payment transactions
                    are encrypted. Only authorised personnel are permitted to access personal data in the course of their work.
                    Whilst we do our best to protect your personal data, no information transferred over the internet can be
                    guaranteed to be completely secure and you provide your information at your own risk.</p>

                    <p>When your credit card details are required as part of the booking process we store the last 4 digits
                    and an authorisation token.  In the case of some low cost airlines, we will use the payment details you
                    provide to purchase the flight seats on your behalf and will use the payment details you provide to do so.</p>

                    <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the
                    European Economic Area ("EEA"), including (in some instances) where we transfer your data to our suppliers
                    so that they can assist us with providing our services to you. Where your information is transferred outside
                    of the EEA, we will take steps to ensure that the information receives the same level of protection as if it
                    remained within the EEA, including by entering into data transfer agreements, using the EU Commission
                    approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or by relying on certification schemes such as the EU-US Privacy
                    Shield. You have the right to details of the mechanism under which your data is transferred outside of the
                    EEA – for this information, please contact us using the details set out under "How can you contact us?" below.

                    <p><strong>When do we share your data with third parties?</strong></p>

                        <li><strong>Our suppliers: </strong>If you make a booking with us, it is necessary for us to share
                        your reservation data with relevant third parties, such as hoteliers, airlines, insurers and

                        payment details, the names and ages of any guests travelling with you, along with any preferences
                        or special circumstances you told us about when you made your booking. If you contact us with a
                        query about your booking we may pass this on to our suppliers if they are better placed to help you.</li>

                        <li><strong>Our group companies: </strong>Your details may be shared with other companies in our
                        corporate group who process information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice for

                        only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use information for
                        any other purpose. Where we provide data to third party service providers for them to provide data
                        analysis or statistical services for us, we will only ever send them aggregated, anonymised or
                        pseudonymised data.</li>

                        <li><strong>Payment Providers and other financial institutions: </strong> If you request a chargeback
                        for your booking, it may be necessary for us to share certain reservation details with the payment
                        service provider and the relevant financial institution so they can handle the chargeback. This may
                        include a copy of your booking confirmation or the IP address that was used to make your reservation.</li>

                        <li><strong>Any competent law enforcement body, regulator, government agency, court or other third
                        party: </strong> where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation,
                        (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights (including to investigate any suspected
                        fraudulent or other criminal activity), or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person.</li>

                        <li><strong>Potential Buyer: </strong> (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any proposed
                        purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use

                    </ul>

                    <p>Any information that is collected from you directly by hotels or other suppliers or which you share
                    through social media platforms such as Facebook is not covered under this Privacy Notice and we would
                    urge to check their own privacy policies before handing over any of your personal data.</p>

                    <p>Further, any information that is collected from you directly by hotels or other suppliers is not covered
                    under this privacy policy and we would urge to check their own privacy policies before handing over any

                    <p><strong>Retention of your personal data</strong></p>
                    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal data (for example, to provide

                    of the products and services we provide to you), we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not
                    possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will
                    securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>


                    <p><strong>What rights do you have in relation to your personal data?</strong></p>

                    <p>You have the following rights in relation to the personal data that we hold about you:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If you wish to <strong>access, correct, update or request deletion</strong> of your personal data,
                        you can do so at any time.</li>

                        <li>You can <strong>object to processing</strong> of your personal data, ask us to <strong>restrict
                        processing</strong> of your personal data or <strong>request portability</strong> of your personal data.</li>

                        <li>You have the right to <strong>opt-out of marketing</strong> communications we send you at any time.
                        You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails
                        we send you.  To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then
                        please contact us.
                        </li>

                        <li>Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal data with your consent, then you can
                        <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the
                        lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing
                        of your personal data conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. </li>

                        <li>You have the right to <strong>complain to a data protection authority</strong> about our
                        collection and use of your personal data. For more information, please contact your local data
                        protection authority. The Information Commissioner's Office is the data protection authority

                    service that we provide to you, so advertisements shown to you on other websites may be offered based
                    on your activities on linked devices (please see our Cookie Statement

                Sunshine act as an agent providing a web search interface between you and various third party suppliers
                of travel products (e.g. flight, hotel or transfer). For flights we act as your agent in processing your
                booking with the airline; we are not the airline’s agent. Each product you choose creates a separate
                contract between you and the supplier of that product.
