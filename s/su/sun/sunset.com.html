						<p><font size="4" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The Information We Collect</font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="3">At some Time Warner sites, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. </font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="3">At some other Time Warner sites, you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person’s name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient’s name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient’s name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. </font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="3">At certain parts of some of our sites, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the site’s activities and offerings.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="3">We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (<i>e.g., </i>Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (<i>e.g.</i>, Windows ’95 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (<i>e.g., </i>America Online, Earthlink).</font></p>
						<p><font size="4" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">How We Use the Information</font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.</font></p>

						<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Agents and contractors of Time Warner who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Time Warner.</font></p>

						<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Certain Time Warner sites may disclose personally identifiable information to companies whose practices are </font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="3">not covered by this privacy notice (<i>e.g., </i>other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers and non-profit organizations) that want to market products or services to you. If a site shares personally identifiable information, it will provide you with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses. For instructions on how to opt out from such disclosures, please send an e-mail along with your first and last name to<b> </b><a href="mailto:privacy@sunset.customersvc.com">privacy@sunset.customersvc.com</a> and <a href="mailto:notransfer@sunset.com">notransfer@sunset.com.</a><br>
