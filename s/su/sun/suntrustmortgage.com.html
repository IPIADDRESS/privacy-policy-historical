      <font size="5"><b>Protecting the Privacy of Our Customers</b></font><br>

<font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">
<p>
At SunTrust, we recognize the sensitive nature of your personal financial 
information, and take every precaution to protect your privacy. 
When you entrust us with your financial information, you can be certain it 
will be used only within our strict guidelines. 
</p>
<p>
We’ve prepared this policy to explain what types of information we 
collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we may share it. 
It covers all the members of the SunTrust Banks, Inc., corporate family, 
including SunTrust Bank, SunTrust Mortgage Corp., SunTrust Securities, 
SunTrust Equitable Securities, Trusco Capital Management, SunTrust Personal 
Loans, Inc., SunTrust Bankcard, N.A., and SunTrust Online, Inc. and all 
other subsidiaries of SunTrust Banks, Inc. 
</p>
<p>
We hope you will read through all the details of SunTrust's official 
position on privacy. At the very least, however, we want you to know that 
SunTrust uses information we know about you responsibly to: 
</p><ul>
<li>provide you with the services you've requested. 
</li><li>offer you other bank products and services. 
</li><li>alert you to financial services products made available by our 
carefully-selected marketing partners.
</li></ul>
Under no circumstance do we provide account or personal information to 
non-SunTrust companies for the purpose of independent telemarketing or 
direct mail marketing of any non-financial products or services of those 
companies. 
<p></p>
<p>
This policy statement takes precedence over any previous privacy policies 
issued by SunTrust Banks, Inc., or any of its subsidiaries.
</p>
<h4>What kinds of information we collect.</h4>
<p>
<b>If you apply for a loan or a new account: </b>
We ask you to provide information about your financial status, such as 
employment, income, monthly expenses, and assets. In most cases you give us 
this information yourself, in person, by mail, or through our web site. If 
we need to know about your credit and repayment history, we use third-party 
sources such as consumer reporting agencies and other creditors. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Once you become a customer: </b>
We maintain information about your transactions with SunTrust and its 
affiliates, including account balances, securities holdings, repayment 
history, and other information. Because it’s important to know what types 
of services may be most valuable to you, we also obtain demographic and 
household information about current and prospective customers from 
specialized marketing information firms. 
</p>
<h4>How we use this information.</h4>
<p>
Most of the information we collect is used for only one purpose: to help 
us deliver the services you’ve requested, easily and efficiently. It may 
also permit us to design and offer specific products and services that we 
believe will be useful to you.
</p>
<h4>Who has access to this information.</h4>
<p>
<b>Within SunTrust: </b>
SunTrust employees are permitted access to the information they need to 
perform their jobs. We maintain strict internal policies against 
unauthorized disclosure or use of customer information. 
</p>
<p>
As a diversified financial services company, SunTrust has a number of 
subsidiaries offering a wide variety of services such as mortgage banking, 
securities brokerage, insurance sales, leasing and consumer finance, and 
many others. As permitted by law, information held by any SunTrust 
subsidiary is available to other members of the SunTrust corporate family 
for authorized purposes, unless a customer has specifically requested 
otherwise. (See “How to opt out of having information disclosed.”) 
</p>
<p>
<b>Marketing partners: </b>
From time to time, we carefully select business partners to provide our 
customers with specialized financial services such as credit cards or 
insurance. Although these partners are not owned by or affiliated with 
SunTrust, they work closely with us to help us meet all of your financial 
needs. If appropriate, we may disclose to these core partners certain 
information such as: 
</p><ul>
<li>Information we receive from you on applications or other forms, such 
as your name, address, Social Security number, assets, or income; 
</li><li>Information about your transactions with SunTrust and its affiliates, 
such as your account balance or payment history; 
</li><li>Information obtained from specialized marketing information firms, 
such as household demographics; and 
</li><li>Information we receive from consumer reporting agencies and others, 
such as your creditworthiness and credit history. 
</li></ul>
Our partners must agree to strictly safeguard the confidentiality of 
customer information, and they are not allowed to disclose this information 
to anyone else without our permission. Customers may request that SunTrust 
not share their information with our marketing partners, as described in 
the next section. 
<p></p>
<p>
<b>Other outside marketers: </b>
We sometimes make limited customer information available to other companies 
that we believe can offer you a helpful financial service. This may include 
your name, address, phone number, and other identifying information you’ve 
provided us on applications or other forms. These outside marketers must 
agree to keep your information confidential and not to share it with anyone 
else. You may choose not to have your information disclosed to these 
companies. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Outside service providers: </b>
At times, we enter into arrangements with companies whose expertise is 
essential for our own services to function properly. For example, we work 
with specialized firms that execute securities transactions, enable online 
banking, and generate account statements for SunTrust customers. As 
permitted by law, we disclose to these service providers the customer 
information necessary to perform these functions. As with all our business 
partners, these companies are required to safeguard your information and 
use it only for authorized purposes. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Consumer reporting agencies: </b>
In accordance with standard banking industry practice, and as allowed 
under federal and state law, SunTrust routinely provides data about 
customer loan repayment and other transactions to these agencies and other 
creditors. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Courts and government entities: </b>
Certain federal and state statutes may require us to disclose information 
about you. For example, if you are involved in litigation with a third 
party, we may be ordered to provide information to a court or the other 
litigant. In these circumstances, only the specific information required 
by law, subpoena, or court order will be disclosed. 
</p>
<p>
<b>A note about former customers’ information. </b>
Although we generally don’t solicit customers who have closed their 
accounts with us, we may share their information with SunTrust affiliates, 
marketing partners, and other third parties as described above. Former 
customers have the same opt-out privilege as active customers. If you opt 
out of information-sharing as a SunTrust customer, this request will stand 
even if your relationship with us ends.  
</p><h4>How to opt out of having information disclosed.</h4>
By making customer information available to other companies owned by 
SunTrust Banks, Inc., and to carefully selected third-party firms, we’re 
able to provide better service and offer financial solutions we believe you 
will value. In fact, some products and services are available only if you 
allow us to share your information.  
<p></p>
<p>
For example, if you have chosen to have overdraft protection on your 
checking account linked to your credit card issued by one of SunTrust's 
non-affiliated partners, we must share information with that partner in 
order for the service to function. If you restrict access to information 
about yourself and your accounts, we may be unable to provide all the 
financial services you need. 
</p>
<p>
If you prefer, you may direct us not to 
disclose personal information about you that isn’t publicly available.

If you write us, please include your name as it appears on your accounts 
with us, as well as your address, Social Security number, and account 
numbers. Each owner of a joint account must opt out separately, although 
both parties may notify us in the same communication. An opt-out request 
becomes effective within 30 days of receipt. 
</p>
<p>
You should also know that even if you opt out of information disclosure, 
the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other laws allow us to share with our 
affiliates and other companies specific details about your transactions 
and experience with us, including information about your account balances 
or payment history.
</p>
<h4>How we protect your privacy online.</h4>
<p>
Our user-friendly Internet web site, <a href="http://www.suntrust.com">
www.suntrust.com</a>, invites you to tell us about yourself through our 
<a href="privacy.stm" onclick="window.open('https://www2.suntrust.com/pers/gues/gues.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,toolbar=no,location=no,status=yes,width=600,height=400'); return false;">
Guest Book</a>. We also usually ask for some 
personal information when you request assistance from us. This allows us 
to respond more quickly to your questions, and possibly suggest other 
services we think you may be interested in. (For more information on the 
use of our website, please see the <a href="https://www2.suntrust.com/userinfo.html">
User Information</a> page.) To protect this information, we maintain 
physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal 
regulations. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Security: </b>
When you submit this private data to us over the Internet, our internal 
security standards guard it in several ways. Encryption helps protect it 
from interception by a third party. The passcodes and other safety features 
we’ve installed also help ensure that the information you provide us 
remains safe and secure. (For more information, please see the 
<a href="https://www2.suntrust.com/security.html">Security and Contact 
Info</a> page.) 
</p>
<p>
<b>Confidentiality: </b>
No one has access to this information except employees who provide services 
to you. 
</p>
<p>
In addition, you should know about these online information 
management tools that may offer additional convenience: 
</p>
<p>
<b>Cookies: </b>
To simplify your online experience with us, we may place a “cookie” on 
your PC while you’re visiting our web site. (A cookie is a piece of 
information that our web server stores on your computer’s hard drive and 
retrieves later.) This helps us recognize you the next time you visit our 
site, saving you the bother of re-entering a password or other personal 
information each time. We do not use cookies to record information that 
will enable anyone to contact you via telephone, e-mail, or regular mail. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Third-party aggregation services: </b>
To help you keep tabs on accounts at a variety of institutions more easily, 
online aggregation or “screen-scraping” services are available at little 
or no cost from SunTrust and a number of other firms. Here’s the way they 
work: 
</p><ul>
<li>You give the service provider the passwords or other access keys to 
your various accounts at banks, brokerage houses, and other institutions. 
</li><li>The service provider then collects statement information from these 
institutions’ web sites on your behalf, and aggregates all this information 
in a single online statement. 
</li><li>Some services also allow you to initiate online payments or other 
transactions.
</li></ul>
Before you grant any company access to your account information, we 
recommend finding out how it will collect and safeguard your data. Consumer 
protections may vary depending upon the nature and identity of the 
aggregator. In any event, if you allow third parties to access your 
personal information, SunTrust can accept no responsibility for their 
actions or for any losses that may result. 
<h4>We respect your privacy.</h4>
As technology continues to advance, you can be sure SunTrust will provide 
the most up-to-date safeguards possible to keep your personal financial 
information confidential and secure. Your trust is important to us – and 
we’re committed to protecting your privacy, whether you do business with 
us on the Internet, in person, or via telephone or mail. As always, we 
thank you for choosing SunTrust. 
<h4>Where to find out more.</h4>
If you have questions, concerns, or comments about our privacy practices 
or the way your information is maintained and used, we’d like to hear from 
you. Please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacy@suntrust.com">
