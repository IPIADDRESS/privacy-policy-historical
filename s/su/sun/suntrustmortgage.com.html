      <font size="5"><b>SunTrust's Principals of Privacy</b></font><br>

<font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">
<p>
Perhaps nothing is more important than safeguarding your financial
information. SunTrust recognizes the sensitive nature of this information,
and takes every precaution to ensure your privacy. When you entrust us with
your financial information, you can be certain it will be used only in an appropriate
manner.
</p>
<p>
This policy statement is designed to explain what type of information
SunTrust collects, how it is used, and with whom and under what circumstances
it will be shared.
</p>
<h4>What Information Do We Collect?</h4>
<p>
For loan applications and new account forms, information regarding
your financial status such as employment, income, monthly expenses
and assets generally comes directly from you voluntarily, in person,
by mail, or through our web site.
</p>
<p>
For credit and repayment history, SunTrust utilizes third party
sources such as credit bureaus and other creditors. We also
obtain demographic and household information from specialized
database information firms.
</p>
<p>
SunTrust also maintains information about your transactions with
SunTrust including account balances, securities holdings, repayment
history and other information.
</p>
<h4>How Do We Use This Information?</h4>
<p>
Primarily, the collected information is used to perform basic banking
business functions and to provide superior customer service. The
information also allows us to offer specific products and services that
we believe will be the most useful to you.
</p>
<h4>Who Has Access To This Information?</h4>
<p>
SunTrust employees are permitted access to the information they
need to perform their jobs. SunTrust maintains strict internal
policies against unauthorized disclosure or use of customer information.
</p>
<p>
As a diversified financial services company, SunTrust has a number of
separate bank and non-bank subsidiaries. Information held by one
SunTrust entity is available to other SunTrust affiliates for authorized
purposes, unless a customer has specifically requested otherwise.
(See "Affiliate Sharing" below for more information.)
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, we will also make the names, addresses and other identifying
information about selected customers available to our business partners
outside of SunTrust who can provide a beneficial service to our customers.
These business partners must agree to keep the information we provide
confidential and not to share it with any other party.
</p>
<p>
In accordance with standard banking industry practice, and as provided
for under applicable federal and state law, SunTrust routinely provides
information about our transactions and experiences with customers (in
particular about loan repayment experience) to credit bureaus and other
creditors.
</p>
<p>
In addition, there are certain federal and state statutes that require
disclosure of information about our customers. For example, if a customer
is involved in litigation with a third party, a court may order SunTrust
to disclose information to a court or another litigant. In such circumstances,
only the specific information required by law, subpoena or court order will be
disclosed.
</p>
<h4>Affiliate Sharing</h4>
<p>
As mentioned above, to help us provide the best possible service, we
generally share information about customers among the various subsidiary
companies owned by SunTrust Banks, Inc. However, if you prefer not to have
certain pieces of your information shared with other SunTrust affiliates,
you may request that we not do so by writing to us at: SunTrust Banks, Inc.,
Customer Information, P.O. Box 4418, Mail Code 5027, Atlanta, Georgia 30302. When you write
to us, please include your name as it appears on your accounts with us, as
well as your address and social security number. Your request will become
effective within 12 weeks of receipt.  It is important to note that information
about specific transactions and experience with a customer will still be shared
with affiliates and others as permitted by the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
</p>
<h4>Use of Our Internet Web Site</h4>
<p>
Our user-friendly Internet web site (www.suntrust.com) invites customers
to provide information about themselves through our
<a href="privacy.stm" onclick="window.open('https://www2.suntrust.com/pers/gues/gues.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,toolbar=no,location=no,status=yes,width=600,height=400'); return false;">Guest Book</a>, as well as
other information request screens from the privacy of their own personal
computer.
</p>
<p>
The personal information you provide to us over the Internet allows
us to respond quickly to your questions about our available products
and services. We will also use this information to furnish you with
information and suggestions about other products and services we believe may
be of interest and benefit to you.
</p>
<p>
SunTrust’s internal security standards safeguard your personal
information submitted by computer in several ways. Encryption helps
protect your private data from interception by a third party. We have
also installed passcodes and other safety features to ensure the
information you provide us on the Internet is safe and secure. (For more
information, please see the <a href="https://www2.suntrust.com/security.html">Security and Contact Info</a> page
on our web site at <a href="https://www2.suntrust.com/security.html">https://www2.suntrust.com/security.html</a>.)
</p>
<h4>A Word About "Cookies"</h4>
<p>
To enhance customer service, SunTrust will occasionally use a
"cookie" on our Internet web site. A cookie is a piece of information
that a web server can store on your PC and retrieve later.
</p>
<p>
There are several beneficial reasons for using cookies.  One reason is
to give you the opportunity to enter your personal information, like your
password, just one time. That way, you don’t have to enter the information
each time you access our site. Cookies do not contain any information that
will enable anyone to contact you via telephone, e-mail or regular mail.
</p>
<h4>Links to Privacy-Related Web Sites</h4>
<p>
If you would like to learn more about privacy issues, you may wish to visit the Federal Trade Commission’s web site at:
</p>
<center><a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/cybrspce/index.html" target="_">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/cybrspce/index.html</a></center>
<p>
This page includes a listing of links to a variety of sites related to
Internet privacy.
</p>
<h4>Thanks for Choosing SunTrust.</h4>
</font><p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">
Whether it’s on the Internet, in person, via telephone or mail, we at
SunTrust are committed to protecting your privacy. And you can rest assured
we will continue to provide you with the most up-to-date safeguards possible
to ensure the safety of your personal financial information.
