Privacy Policy<br><br>
Updated October 5, 2009 <br><br>

Thank you for visiting this website (the "Website"). Your patronage means a lot to us.   At the Sundance Channel LLC   ("Company"), we understand that privacy is an important issue for visitors to our websites and we are committed to providing you clear information about how we treat information provided to us.  This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes the information we collect, what we do with it and the safeguards we have in place to protect it. <br> <br>

Your use of any part of the Website indicates your acceptance of this Policy and of the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Policy.  Please note that this Policy applies only to personal information collected on the Website. It does not apply to any other information collected or obtained by any other means by Company, its parents, affiliates, or subsidiaries.<br><br>

As we update and expand our services, we reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted here so that you are always aware of what information is collected, how it is used and when, if ever, it is disclosed.  Please check this page periodically for changes.  Your continued use of this site after changes to the Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the terms of any revisions to this Policy.<br><br>

INFORMATION COLLECTION<br><br>

When you register for an account or visit certain portions of the Website, you may be prompted to provide, on a voluntary basis, certain information about yourself such as: (i) name; (ii) email address; (iii) date of birth; (iv) mailing address; (v) telephone numbers; and (vi) interests and hobbies.  You are not required to provide any information to use our Website, although certain areas may require registration.<br><br>

Certain third parties may join with us to offer website activities, features or promotions, such as contests or special events.  By submitting personal information in conjunction with these joint activities, you are providing that information to both parties simultaneously.  The co-sponsor or partner may maintain a separate privacy policy governing the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information, and this Policy does not cover their collection, use, and/or disclosure.  For example, during your visit to our Website, you may link to or view as part of a frame on a page of this Website, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party.  Also, through this Website you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, websites, advertisements, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. Company is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature page or page operated by a third party. <br><br>  

The Website may link to certain third parties who offer services on our behalf.  Information collected on those sites is subject to the third party's own privacy policy.  However, in some circumstances, those third parties may provide us with the information you provide to the third party. If so, we will treat that information in accordance with this Policy.<br><br>

We may also use cookies and other technologies to learn about how you interact with our site to provide you with better service, to improve your customer experience, and for internal research and reporting purposes. We also may collect anonymous data on Website activity, such as how many people visit the site, what pages they visit, where they come from, how long they stay, what items they purchase, etc.   Such data is collected on an aggregate, anonymous basis, through the use of Internet server logs and cookies.  We may also take non-anonymous data and de-identify it so that it becomes anonymous either by itself or when aggregated.  We may use any anonymous or aggregated data for any purpose, including for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, such as advertisers.<br><br>

INFORMATION USE<br><br>

By providing information on the Website, you agree that personal information that you provide may be used by Company, its parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries to communicate with you for the purposes of: offering discounts, promoting services and products, informing you about new services and products, providing news on upcoming sporting and entertainment events, providing programming schedules, conducting surveys, marketing special gift or discount offerings, offering ticket discounts, conducting contests and sweepstakes, and similar purposes.  For a current list of Company’s affiliates, please <a href="http://www.cablevision.com/about/index.jsp">click here</a>. <br><br>

From time to time, we may provide access to information to select third parties to assist us in providing services or for other legitimate business purposes. For example, we may provide access to companies providing services to us, including billing, sales and marketing, market research, fulfillment, data storage, analysis and processing, and legal services.  We may also provide access to third parties who assist us in providing targeted advertising. Third parties who have such access may not use the information for any other purpose, including their own marketing.<br><br>

INFORMATION DISCLOSURE<br><br>

We will disclose personally identifiable information to non-affiliated third parties (a) as set forth in this Policy; (b) where it is necessary for us to render our services or conduct a legitimate business activity related to our services; or (c) with appropriate consent.  We may disclose personally identifiable information to affiliated third parties, including parents, affiliates, subsidiaries and joint venture partners at any time, subject to the use restrictions set forth in this Policy.
You acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve and disclose your account information and content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, or other contracts with you; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect our rights, property or personal safety as well as those of our users and the public. We may also disclose information to law enforcement agencies in emergency circumstances, where the disclosure of such information is consistent with the types of emergency disclosures permitted or required by law.<br><br>
