                    <p>To purchase services from SurpassHosting, Users must provide detailed information including contact information to SurpassHosting, including names, email addresses, physical addresses, and phone numbers. Users are required to provide this information to SurpassHosting in order to purchase SurpassHosting services. During the purchase process, Users may provide optional information such as instant messager details and secondary, billing, or abuse email addresses to SurpassHosting. If that information is provided, it is covered by this Privacy Policy; however, providing it is voluntary. This information is a subset of Identification Tools, and is referred to individually as “Registration Information.”</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>b. Identification Tools</p>
                    <p>SurpassHosting may use automated Identification Tools like cookies and Google Analytics. Each of these Identification Tools work differently, however, they all collect information related to the website you came to SurpassHosting from, a User’s operating system, browser type, where Users go on SurpassHosting’s website, length of time on SurpassHosting’s website, and where a User goes after visiting SurpassHosting’s website. In addition, Identification Tools may keep Users logged into SurpassHosting’s system. From time-to-time, SurpassHosting may use Identification Tools that will be used to serve advertising and other information to Users after they visit SurpassHosting’s website. Because the technologies underlying Identification Tools differ, Users may, or may not, be able to choose not to provide information to them.</p>

In the course of providing support to Users, SurpassHosting may annotate the Registration Information with information disclosed while providing support (Support Information).</p>

                    <p><em>ii.</em> SurpassHosting may disclose information covered by this Privacy Policy in connection with the sale of its business.</p>

                    <p><em>iii.</em> SurpassHosting may aggregate information covered by this Privacy Policy and disclose it outside its business.  This information will not identify Users individually.</p>

                    <p><em>iv.</em> SurpassHosting may use information covered by this Privacy Policy to contact you directly to respond to questions, provide its services to you, manage your account or to inform you of service announcements.</p>

                    <p><em>v.</em> SurpassHosting may use information covered by this Privacy Policy to inform you of new products and services. In informing you of new products and services, SurpassHosting may include third party products and services. While SurpassHosting may use information that identifies you individually to market these third party products and services, that information is not disclosed to the third parties. In this use of User information, third parties will only receive aggregate information. However, should a User respond to a marketing announcement, third parties will become aware of the User individually.
