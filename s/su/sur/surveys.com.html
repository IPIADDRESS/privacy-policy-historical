<p class="bodytext">Local Shared Objects:
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Our survey website uses Local Shared Objects (LSO), also known as “Flash cookies,” for a variety of research purposes, including storing some of your preferences, displaying content based upon what you view, personalizing your visit, tracking your behavior and activities across multiple visits to the site, and to combat survey fraud.

<p class="bodytext">Web Beacons:<br>&nbsp;<br>A web beacon (also known as a tag, clear gif or 1x1 pixel), consists of a small string of code that is embedded within a web page or email. There may or may not be a visible graphic image associated with the web beacon, and often the image is designed to blend into the background of a web page or email. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">We use web beacons in our email messages to help determine whether our messages are opened and to verify any clicks through to links within the email. We may use this information to determine which of our emails are more interesting to users, to improve the quality of the emails that we send and to query users who do not open our emails as to whether they wish to continue receiving them. The web beacon is deleted when you delete the email. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">For members who are enrolled in our optional Ad/Web Tracking research program described previously, we use web beacons that interact with our tracking cookies to inform us when a participating member has viewed ads and other online content that we are measuring. We and our authorized service providers may link personally identifiable information to web beacons for operational and research purposes. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">If you would prefer not to have web beacons in the emails that you receive, you should adjust your email program to receive messages in plain text rather than HTML.&nbsp; It is also possible to detect and control web beacons that are present on web pages by downloading a plug-in for your browser.

<p class="bodytext">Digital Fingerprinting:
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>

This data may include personally identifiable information such as an email address or an Internet Protocol (IP) address, as well as non-personally identifiable information such as a computer operating system or browser version number. A digital fingerprint commonly takes the form of a small file that websites can place on your computer through normal usage of your web browser.

</p>
<p class="bodytext">GfK and Ask GfK utilize Digital Fingerprinting technology to assist our clients in ensuring the integrity of survey results by enabling us to authenticate users and to help ensure users participate in surveys no more than the maximum allowable participation.
