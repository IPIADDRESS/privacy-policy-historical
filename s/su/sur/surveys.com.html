														<p><a name="privacy">NOP</a> World Limited ("NOP") UK takes your privacy seriously.  This Privacy Policy explains the steps NOP take to ensure information about you is kept secure and confidential.  In addition to the undertakings which NOP give you here you should know that NOP is bound by all the major market research codes of conduct.  These include the American CASRO code (<a href="http://www.casro.org/" target="new">http://www.casro.org/</a>) and the European ESOMAR code (<a href="http://www.esomar.nl/" target="new">http://www.esomar.nl/</a>). 
</p><p><b><i>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully as once you use NOP's web site or participate in any of the panel surveys online you will be deemed to have read and accepted this Privacy Policy. </i></b>
</p></font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif" size="2" color="#000033">NOP have developed it's web site to provide a forum for panel surveys which it hopes to carry out for our clients with your assistance.

														</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif" size="2" color="#000033"><b>1.  The information we collect and updating your details.</b>
<br><br>
<b> A) Personal and Demographic Information</b>
<br>
During the NOP recruitment process, NOP may collect personal information such as your name, address, and the names and ages of members of your household (“Personal Information”).  In addition, NOP frequently asks Panel Members for characteristics (such as health problems or consumer habits), attributes, and demographic information (such as age, income, gender) (collectively, “Demographic Information”).  
<br><br>
You are in control of the Personal Information and Demographic Information that you provide to NOP. We rely on you to provide updates to your Personal Information and Demographic Information.  You can: 
<br>
</font></p><ul><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif" size="2" color="#000033">
	<li>Ask for a copy of your Personal Information or Demographic Information.
	</li><li>Ask for your Personal Information or Demographic Information to be corrected or updated.
	</li><li>Ask us to remove your Personal Information or Demographic Information from your records.
</li></font></ul><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif" size="2" color="#000033">
To do this, please contact us using the links provided later in this statement.  NOP will use reasonable efforts to provide the requested information to you.
<br><br>
<b>B) Operating Information </b>
<br> <br>
NOP may, in the course of interacting with Panel Members, gather other types of information from Panel Members (“Operating Information”).  For example, as an NOP Panel Member, you will receive surveys from NOP on a regular basis.  These surveys will ask questions about your interests, needs, and attitudes.  We will receive your responses to these surveys. Similarly, if we offer other features, services, or programs in which you explicitly agree to participate, then NOP will receive information from those features, services, or programs.  
<br> <br>
NOP will only collect personal information about you when you register for and take part in the panel surveys on its web site. NOP will always let you have a copy of all personal information it has about you should you request it in accordance with relevant Data Protection and Privacy regulation . You are able to update and amend your personal information at any time by contacting NOP via e-mail at <a href="mailto:pamhughes@nopworld.com">pamhughes@nopworld.com</a>.  NOP may if necessary contact you to validate your responses given in the panel survey but it will never question your responses or your reasons for them.
<br> <br>
<b>2. Purposes for which we use information about our users.</b>
<br> <br>
<b>A) Personal and Demographic Information</b> 
<br> <br>
Personal Information may be used to set up e-mail accounts for each household member who is 13 years of age or older, to communicate with you and your household members, and to assist you with questions that you may have about the NOP Panel.  It may also be used for panel recruitment, contest entry processing or delivery of free gifts to members of the NOP Panel.  Personal Information concerning location or address is also used to ensure that our panel accurately represents a particular population.
<br> <br>
Panel Members are asked for Demographic Information in order to pre-qualify members or households for surveys that target specific groups.  We also use this information to ensure that our panel accurately represents the country’s population as a whole.
<br> <br>
NOP uses Personal Information and Demographic Information solely in the conduct of its research business.  Personal Information or Demographic Information may be combined with information collected about you by NOP or third parties with your express permission, with information that is collected about you from public records, or with information that NOP may acquire from third parties that have a legal right to provide such information to NOP. 
<br> <br>
<b>B) Operating Information</b> 
<br> <br>
NOP uses Operating Information solely in the conduct of its research business.  As is the case with Personal Information and Demographic Information, Operating Information may be combined with information collected about you by third parties with your express permission, with information that is collected about you from public records, or with information that NOP may acquire from third parties that have a legal right to provide such information to NOP.  
<br> <br>
<b>3. Passing on information about you</b>
<br> <br>
NOP will never share Personal Information regarding Panel Members with any third parties without your express permission, except as set forth in this paragraph.  NOP may disclose the information obtained from you to its partner, Tiscali UK Limited who will only use this information to provide specific services to NOP, or services on behalf of NOP, such as panel recruitment, contest entry processing or delivery of free gifts to NOP Panel Members. NOP may also disclose the information obtained from you to other third parties to assist us to carry out market research and to process, analyze and report on the results of the panel surveys. These partners have agreed not to share or resell this data and they are contractually obligated not to use any personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services, unless you enter into a relationship with them that would directly allow them to do so. 
<br> <br>
In certain circumstances, NOP’s clients, or a mutually acceptable representative, may observe a limited number of interviews for the purpose of checking quality and data preparation, in accordance with the CASRO and ESOMAR Codes of conduct. In certain cases, such as panels or situations where you might be known to (or be in subsequent contact with) NOP’s client or its representative, it will only do so with your prior agreement. Any such observers will be bound by the provisions of the US or European market research code of conduct, regarding the strict preservation of your anonymity.
<br> <br>
NOP will only publish or report on aggregated or group results to panel surveys. It will never publish or report on individual responses. NOP may disclose Personal Information in connection with legal proceedings or potential legal proceedings or if otherwise permitted or required to do so by law. 
<br> <br>
NOP is an expanding business, and like other companies, we sometimes acquire or divest business units.  As part of such transfers, we may convey the business assets of the particular business unit, including Personal Information, Demographic Information, or Operating Information of Panel Members. 
<br> <br>
<b>4. Security </b>
<br> <br>
Keeping information about you secure is very important to NOP.  We have    appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against loss, misuse or alteration of your Personal Information. Vendors, contractors, or partners of NOP who have access to your Personal Information in connection with providing services for NOP are contractually required to keep the information confidential and are not permitted to use this information for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for NOP.  
<br> <br>
<b>5. Cookies</b>
<br> <br>
NOP may use ‘Cookies’ in order to provide better service to you.  A cookie is a small piece of information that a web site stores via your web browser on your PC and which can later be retrieved. Cookies cannot be read by a web site other than the one that sent it. Most cookies last only through one session or visit to the NOP web site. None will contain information that will enable anyone to contact you via telephone, e-mail, or any other means. You can set up your web browser to inform you when cookies are sent or to prevent cookies from being sent, however if you do this you may not use this web site.  
<br> <br>
<b>6. Transferring your information abroad</b>  
<br> <br>
In order to process information supplied by you to NOP it may be necessary to transfer your data internationally within the NOP group or to an associated company. By using this web site you consent to such international transfer of your personal information. NOP data protection standards are the same, regardless of where your information is stored. 
<br> <br>
NOP adheres to United States/European Union Safe Harbor principles. If you feel that Safe Harbor privacy principles may have been violated by NOP, you may contact- <a href="mailto:j.megahey@nopworld.com">Jackie Megahey</a> at NOP or CASRO, 3 Upper Devon, Port Jefferson, NY 11777 (email: <a href="mailto:casro@casro.org">casro@casro.org</a>) (telephone:  631-928-6954) with your complaint.  NOP is a member of CASRO.  
<br> <br>
<b> 7. Children’s Privacy</b> 
<br> <br>
NOP believes that it's especially important to protect children's privacy online and encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to participate and monitor their Internet activity.
<br> <br>
NOP complies with all applicable national and international children's privacy regulations. 
<br> <br>
We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. We do not permit children who are under 13 years of age to become NOP Panel Members.  We do not collect any Personal Information from children under 13 years of age.   As part of the registration process for new Panel Members, we collect from the new Panel Member the names of each individual in the Panel Members’ household, which may include the names of children who are under 13 years of age.  Occasionally we may send a survey to a Panel Member who is a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 that asks that Panel Member to have his or her child who is under 13 answer the survey.  We take reasonable steps to ensure parental consent to such procedure by sending the survey to the parent or guardian’s password-protected email address and obtaining verifiable consent from the parent or guardian, which may include receipt of a signed form from the parent or guardian via postal mail or facsimile.  The information collected in response to such surveys is not combined with identifying information about the child.  In every case such survey does not collect Personal Information about the child.  
<br> <br>
If a Panel Member has provided us with Personal Information about a child in the Panel Member’s household who is under the age of 13, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us at the email address or mailing address listed at the bottom of this Privacy Statement if he or she would like this information deleted from our records. We will use reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our databases. 
<br> <br>
For further information about the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, you can visit:  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy" target="new">www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy</a>.
<br> <br>
If you would like to contact us about your or your child's Personal Information, or to find out how you can have your child's Personal Information removed from our database, please see the “Access To Your Information and Complaints” section, below.
<br> <br>
<b>8. Access to Your Information And Complaints</b>
<br> <br>
<b>A) Accessing, Correcting, Updating and Preventing Use of Your Personal Information or Demographic Information</b>
<br> <br>

i) Access, Correct, Update Your Personal or Demographic Information, by emailing your request to <a href="mailto:chenderson@surveys.com">chenderson@surveys.com</a> or by sending us a letter to the address listed below.

<b>9. Opting Out</b>
<br><br>
At any time, you may discontinue your participation in the NOP Panel by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:chenderson@surveys.com">chenderson@surveys.com</a>.  Parents or legal guardians of any member of the NOP Panel who is under the age of eighteen may discontinue the participation of such child in the same manner.  Please note that opting-out of the NOP Panel will not automatically cause us to delete Personal, Demographic, or Operating Information about you (or your child) that we have previously collected.  We will do so, however, at your request, as set forth above.
