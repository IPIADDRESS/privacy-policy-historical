				<p>A FAQ about our Privacy Policy is available <a href="http://www.surfrider.org/pages/privacy-policy-faqs">here.</a></p>

<p>Welcome to www.surfrider.org (the “<strong>Site</strong>”), a website operated by the Surfrider Foundation (“<strong>Surfrider</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, or “<strong>our</strong>”). We are a non-profit grassroots organization dedicated to the protection and enjoyment of the world’s oceans, waves and beaches. We provide our users (collectively, “<strong>you</strong>” or “<strong>your</strong>”) with resources and information about our organization and our cause, as well as a number of related services (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”). We know you are concerned about your privacy, so we developed this privacy policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) to explain how we collect, use, and disclose information from and/or about you, whether you are simply visiting our Site or whether you are a member of our organization.</p>

<p>YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY. BY USING THIS SITE AND PROVIDING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE TRANSFER OF DATA FROM YOUR COUNTRY TO A COUNTRY THAT HAS LESS STRINGENT LAWS, AND THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN CONFORMANCE WITH THIS POLICY.</p>

<p>So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” in this Privacy Policy, we mean contact information (e.g., name, address, email address, or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual. When we use the phrase “<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is neither used nor intended to be used to personally identify an individual.</p>

<p><strong>How We Collect Information. </strong><br>
<u>Personal Information</u><br>
In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Services to you and helps us learn more about the use of the Site and/or Services. We collect Personal Information that you or someone else submits to us voluntarily through the Site or the Services. If you are a member of our organization (“<strong>Member</strong>’), paying for a Member’s annual dues, or making a donation to Surfrider, we may also collect Personal Information offline. One type of Personal Information we collect is “<strong>Payment Information</strong>”, which means the information necessary to process a payment from you, including the following: (i) your name as it appears on the card, (ii) the credit card type (VISA, MasterCard, American Express or any other issuer then accepted by Surfrider), (iii) a valid credit card number; (iv) the date of expiration of your credit card, (v) your billing address, and (vi) any activation numbers or codes needed to charge your card.</p>

<p>To receive our newsletter, you must provide your email address. When you communicate with us through our Site or by sending us an email, we may collect and store any information that is contained in your communications with us. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Site or Services you are able to use.</p>

<p>If you become a Member, we will need to collect additional Personal Information about you to process and administer your Membership. We may receive this Personal Information from you or, if a third party buys you a gift Membership to our organization, from the party paying for your Membership. If you do not wish for us to collect or hold information about you that you did not provide to us, please see the section below regarding deleting and changing your information. If you are the party paying for a Membership but are not yourself a Member, the only personal information we collect about you will be your Payment Information.</p>

<p>If you wish to donate to Surfrider, we will collect your Payment Information for such donation.</p>

<p>One of the Services we provide is our application on through http://www.facebook.com (“<strong>Facebook</strong>”), through which you may make certain Personal Information available to us. You do not need to be a Member to use this application. You may restrict and edit the Personal Information that you make available to us by editing your privacy settings on Facebook. We do not collect or record any Personal Information through Facebook unless you expressly request us to do so to provide you certain Services (e.g., requesting Membership information or a newsletter subscription). We may collect the information about your use of the application on Facebook or that you otherwise make available, however, in anonymized manner such that your identity cannot be ascertained from such information. For example, we may record that a user “liked” content or the number of photos tagged by a user, but we will not record that you liked that content or that you tagged certain photos. We will consider this aggregated and anonymous information collected from Facebook as “<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>”.</p>

<p><u>Anonymous Information</u><br>
As you use the Site or Services, certain Anonymous Information may be passively collected and stored, such as your Internet protocol address, domain names, browser type, and access times. We may also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your browser while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting a Cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept Cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or functionalities of the Site or Services, including signing up for Membership online.</p>

<p><strong>How We Use Information. </strong><br>
<u>Personal Information</u><br>
We will use your Personal Information to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Administer your Membership;</li>
	<li>Provide you with Services and customer support;</li>
	<li>Tailor the features, performance and support of the Site or Services to you;</li>
	<li>Collect Membership fees and/or donations;</li>
	<li>Market our products and services to you and those of third parties we believe may be of interest to you;</li>
	<li>Respond to your requests, resolve disputes and/or troubleshoot problems;</li>
	<li>Improve the quality of the Site and the Services; and</li>
	<li>Communicate with you about the Site and the Services.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also use your Personal Information to create Anonymous Information records by excluding information that makes the information personally identifiable to you. You can opt out of receiving certain communications from the Site such as our newsletter by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email. Please note that even if you unsubscribe or opt-out, we may still send you Membership, Site and Service related communications (e.g., emails related to your questions or comments).</p>

<p><u>Anonymous Information</u><br>
We may, through our use of Cookies, keep you logged into our Site, track your session history and collect your click-stream data. We may also tailor Site content to your interests and personalize your use of the Site. We may use your Anonymous Information to analyze usage patterns so that we may enhance the Site or Services, improve our internal operations and the content of our software, and customize the Site or Services for you.</p>

<p><strong>How We Disclose Information.</strong><br>
<u>Personal Information</u><br>
We may disclose certain Personal Information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To third party vendors who help us provide the Services or the Site;</li>
	<li>To third parties to whom you ask or have authorized us to send Personal Information;</li>
	<li>To any subsidiary organizations, joint ventures, or other organizations under our control (collectively, “Affiliates”), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy; or</li>
	<li>If we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our Terms of Use; (b) comply with relevant laws or to respond to requests from law enforcement or other government officials relating to investigations or alleged illegal activity; or (c) protect and defend our rights or property or the rights and property of you or third parties.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Anonymous Information</u><br>
We reserve the right to disclose Anonymous Information publicly without restriction, including to third party vendors who may help us enhance or provide the Site or Services or to third parties.</p>

<p><strong>Updating and Controlling Your Information.</strong><br>
If you are a Member, you may update certain of your Personal Information on our Site. You may request deletion of your Personal Information by us, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete Personal Information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives and we may also retain Anonymous Information about your use of our Services. Once we disclose some of your Personal Information to third parties, we cannot access that Personal Information any longer and cannot force the deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to whom we have made those disclosures.</p>

<p><strong>Information Disclosed to Third Parties</strong><br>
This Privacy Policy addresses our use and disclosure of information we collect from and/or about you on the Site. Helping you to protect your information is a vital part of our mission. It is up to you to make sure you are comfortable with the information you choose to provide us and the information you choose to publish. You understand that when you use the Site, certain information you post or provide through the Site, such as your name, photographs, and comments, may be shared with other users and posted on publicly available portions of the Site or the Service. Please keep in mind that if you choose to disclose Personal Information when posting comments or other information or content through the Site, this information may become publicly available and may be collected and used by others, including people outside the Surfrider community. We will not have any obligations with respect to any information that you post to parts of the Site available to others, and recommend that you use caution when giving out information to others in public forums online or otherwise. We may also share the information you publish with other third parties.</p>

<p>Please be aware that any Personal Information you make available to us on Facebook may also be made available generally on Facebook, including to third parties, pursuant to your Facebook privacy settings. Please be thoughtful about your Facebook privacy settings. The use and disclosure restrictions contained in this Privacy Policy will not apply to any third party, including Facebook. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable.</p>

<p>The Site may contain links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us, including our partner sites. We have no control over, do not review and are not responsible for the privacy policies of or content displayed on such other websites. When you click on such a link, you will leave our Site and go to another site. During this process, another entity may collect Personal Information or Anonymous Information from you. The Site may also contain links to other websites controlled by us but which operate under different privacy policies. Please review the privacy policy of any new site you visit.</p>

<p><strong>Children.</strong><br>
The Site is not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Services. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under 18 years of age, and no part of our Site or Services is designed to attract people under 18 years of age. If we later learn that a user is under 18 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Site and the Services.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy.</strong><br>
