<font color="#0376BF"><b>SurveyClub.com Privacy Policy</b></font><br><br>

SurveyClub.com takes your privacy seriously, and has created this Privacy Policy in order to 
demonstrate our firm commitment to online privacy. Keep reading to learn more about our information 
gathering and dissemination practices, and our use of personally identifiable information.<br><br>

<b>IP Addresses</b><br><br>

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our site or web server,
and for the general administration of our website. Your IP address, should 
you decide to register and/or create a SurveyClub account, is also used to
help prevent you from creating duplicate accounts.<br><br>

<b>Cookies</b><br><br>

Upon your first visit to this web site, a "cookie" is sent
to your computer. A cookie is a tiny file that identifies you as a
unique user. It stores personal preferences and user data, however,
in no way does this tell us who you are. SurveyClub.com has two primary
uses for its cookies.<br><br>

First, we use cookies to track special offers and promotions that may
be presented to you as you navigate our website. This is done so that
you are not presented with the same special offers and/or promotions
over and over, or after you have indicated you are not interested.<br><br>

Secondly, we use cookies as part of our authenticaton system when 
you login to your account. If you select the "remember me" option when 
logging in, our site will set a cookie so that you do not have to login 
again the next time you visit SurveyClub.com.<br><br>

While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors
to this site always have the option of disabling cookies in their web
browser. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can
reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie
is being sent.<br><br>

<b>Information Gathering</b><br><br>

This web site collects online contact information in various ways,
including inquiry forms, registration forms, surveys, and contests.
The information collected may be used to send the user information
about our company, or to get in touch with the user when necessary.<br><br>

Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the opt-out/modify
section below.<br><br>

<b>Information Dissemination</b><br><br>

None of the information that is collected by this web site is rented, 
sold, or shared with any 3rd parties for any purpose -- except in the 
case of unique identifiers (such as social security and Tax Id numbers) 
which are provided to the IRS for tax-reporting purposes if applicable.<br><br>

<b>Links to Other Sites</b><br><br>

SurveyClub.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates
to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that
third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates
and other content providers accessible through our site, may have
their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For
example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view
as part of a frame of content that is actually created or hosted
by a third party.<br><br>

Also, via our site you may be introduced to, or be able to
access, information, websites, features, contests or sweepstakes
offered by other parties. SurveyClub.com is not responsible for
the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check
the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when
providing information on a feature or page operated by a third
party.<br><br>

<b>Children Under 13</b><br><br>

SurveyClub.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally
Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except
as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any
information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we
will delete that information immediately. If you believe
SurveyClub.com has any information from or about anyone under 13,
please contact us.<br><br>

<b>Security</b><br><br>

This web site has security measures in place to protect against loss,
misuse and/or alteration of the information that you provide. Furthermore,
we have taken every precaution technically possible to prevent any
unauthorized access to the contents of this web server.<br><br>

<b>Opt-Out/Modify</b><br><br>

SurveyClub.com provides every user with the opportunity to 
opt-out of receiving future communications from us, change and modify
information previously provided, or remove their information from our
databases altogether. You may do so in any of the following ways:<br><br>

1. Email: <a href="mailto:support@surveyclub.com">support@surveyclub.com</a><br>
