						<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

						<h2>YOUR PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT TO US</h2>
						<p>Market research serves an important function in society. Businesses and governments make better decisions through survey research. As a survey participant, your opinions help companies develop new products, make existing ones better, and improve customer service. </p>
						<p>If you have any privacy questions or concerns, please contact our Privacy Officer via e-mail at (privacy@surveyjunkie.com) or by mail (1200 S Brand Blvd, #112, Los Angeles, CA 91204).</p>

						<h2>INFORMATION COLLECTED AND USED</h2>
						<p>SurveyJunkie.com (SURVEY JUNKIE) collects user-submitted information including name and email address to verify new accounts and send notifications related to SURVEY JUNKIE's services. This web site collects online contact information in various ways, including inquiry forms, registration forms, surveys, and contests. SURVEY JUNKIE collects additional data that is included in member profile submitted by the member voluntarily. When you participate in research, you may be asked for your personal opinions, as well as demographic information, such as your age and household composition. You may refuse to answer certain questions or discontinue participation in a study at any time.  Email addresses are used to send notifications related to the service(s) for which you have signed up, including but not limited to: a) an invitation to participate in survey research, b) an invitation to conduct a research survey interview with you, c) validate of answers you gave in a recent survey we conducted, d) an invitation to participate in sponsored programs from our advertisers, and d) notification of updates and to ensure that our records of your personal information are correct. (applicable only to panels). Occasionally, we may contact you also to notify you if you have won a prize draw that we sponsored and/or to ask for your permission to use your personal information for a purpose that was not explained to you when we first collected your personal information.  </p>
						<p>Like most web sites, we gather certain non-personal information automatically and store it in various databases, cookies, or log files. This information includes IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, to prevent creating duplicate accounts, to administer our site, to track users' movements around our site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. To protect against fraud, we may link this automatically-collected data to information submitted.</p>
						<p>SURVEY JUNKIE makes reasonable efforts to keep personal information in its possession or control, which is used on an ongoing basis, accurate, complete, current and relevant, based on the most recent information available to us. We rely on you to help us keep your personal information accurate, complete and current by answering our questions honestly.</p>

						<h2>Cookies:</h2>
						<p>A cookie, also known as an HTTP cookie, web cookie, or browser cookie, is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in a user's web browser while the user is browsing that website. Every time the user loads the website, the browser sends the cookie back to the server to notify the website of the user's previous activity.</p>
						<p>We use cookies on our survey site to help us provide you with a better experience along with quality control and validation functions. No personal information is stored on any cookie that we use. Some of the cookies that we use on this site are required because they identify you as a valid member, and they protect access to your profile and account information. The privacy settings of your browser must be configured to allow cookies from (www.surveyjunkie.com) or you will not be able to register on the (www.surveyjunkie.com) panel or access the Members Area of this site. If you wish, you can adjust your browser’s privacy settings to delete cookies upon exiting web sites or when you close your browser. Information stored in cookies will never contain any personally identifiable information. Third parties also place scripts on our site such as analytics providers which may place their own cookies on your system. This data is only collected in the aggregate. Cookies are used to identify a unique user, authentication of the user, store personal preferences, track and personalize offers and promotions.</p>
						<p>This site may at times also use Flash Local Shared Objects (LSO), also known as “Flash cookies,” to store some of your preferences, to display content based upon what you view, to personalize your visit, to combat fraud that endangers the quality of research, or to otherwise track your behavior and activities across multiple visits to the site. We use Flash cookies strictly for research purposes only.</p>
						<p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored and how the data are stored. The latest versions of popular browsers now allow internet users to manage Flash cookies using browser privacy settings or downloading add-ons.</p>
						<p>If your browser does not support these features, then you can manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies or disable their use entirely by visiting Macromedia’s website, the manufacturer of Flash Player, at the following link:</p>
						<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html" target="_blank">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>
						<p>We use optional cookies, through browsers, Flash, and possible software applications for conducting advertising and website research. These cookies are available only to members who have explicitly agreed to participate in our behavioral tracking research program. The cookies keep track of certain online advertisements and web pages that you see, including how frequently the online content that we are measuring is viewed by your computer.</p>
						<p>Device Identification technologies assign a unique identifier to a user's computer to identify and track the computer. SURVEY JUNKIE may on some occasions use Device identification technology to collect personal information or track the online activities of computer users. We use the technology, among other things, to assist our clients in ensuring the integrity of survey results. The technology analyses information and data obtained from your computer's web browser and from other publically available data points, including for example the technical settings of your computer, the characteristics of your computer, and your computer's IP address. This data is used to create a unique identifier assigned to your computer. The unique identifier may be an alpha-numeric ID which we retain. We do not retain the information analysed by the technology to create the unique identifier. The technology does not disrupt or interfere with your use or control of your computer and it does not alter, modify or change the settings or functionality of your computer.</p>

							</p><ol>
								<li>link or associate your unique identifier to you and any of the information you provide to us;</li>
								<li>share your unique identifier with our clients and with other sample or panel providers; and</li>
								<li>receive or obtain a unique identifier linked to you from a third party, including without limitation a sample or panel provider or a client of our firm.</li>
							</ol>
						<p></p>
						<p>Any unique identifier(s) linked to a specific individual will be protected in accordance with this privacy policy. We shall use and distribute the technology in a professional and ethical manner and in accordance with our privacy policy, any statements and/or disclosures made by our firm to you, and applicable laws and industry codes.</p>
						<p>In the event that we discover or learn of any unethical conduct in connection with the use of the technology, or that the technology is being used in a manner that is inconsistent with the statements and/or disclosures made by us to respondents or in violation of applicable laws and codes, we will take immediate action to prohibit such unethical conduct and to ensure the proper administration of the technology.</p>
