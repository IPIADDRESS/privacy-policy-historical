		<a name="informationCollection"><h2>1. Information Collection &amp; Use</h2></a>
		<p>We are committed to protecting online user privacy. In order to ensure your privacy, information we collect is used only in the manner and for the purposes described below.</p>

		<h3>1.1 Registration</h3>

		<h3>1.2 Children's Privacy Policy</h3>
		<p>Surf Canyon is not directed towards children 13 years of age or under and we do not knowingly collect any information from children 13 years of age or under through our web site.</p>

		<h3>1.3 Uses of Information</h3>
		
		<p>Surf Canyon uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the search results on selected search engines (currently Google, Yahoo!, Bing and Craigslist), to customize sponsored results (which are always clearly labeled as such) on selected search engines (currently Google and Yahoo!), to improve our services, and to provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.</p>
		
		<h3>1.4 Profile</h3>
		<p>We store information that we collect through client-side cookies and server-side log files to create a "profile" of your preferences.

		<a name="informationSharing"><h2>2. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2></a>
		
		<h3>2.1 Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</h3>
		
		<p>We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners. This information does not identify individual users. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information. No registration, login or cookies are required to use any of our services.</p>

		<a name="legalDisclaimer"><h2>3. Legal Disclaimer</h2></a>
		
		<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site</p>

		<h3>3.1 Log Files</h3>
		
		<p>
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. </p>

		<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>

		<h3>3.2 Cookies</h3>
		
		<p>
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. Cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but the ability for our service to provide accurate personaliztion for you will be limited. </p>

		<h3>3.3 Third Party Search Engines</h3>
		
		<p>
When you execute a query on selected search engines (currently Google, Yahoo, Bing and Craigslist), the Surf Canyon browser extension makes additional network connections to the search engine and execute additional queries.  The additional network connections may cause you to exceed a search engine's bandwidth limit more quickly.  The additional search engine queries may affect the search engine's own personalization algorithms.</p>

		<h3>3.4 Third Party Advertisers</h3>
		
		<p>The ads that we deliver to users may be provided by our advertising partners. We share Web site usage information about users with reputable third parties for the purpose of targeting our advertisements on this site. The information that our advertising partners collect is not personally identifiable.</p>

		<p>
The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

	<p>
In the event Surf Canyon goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
