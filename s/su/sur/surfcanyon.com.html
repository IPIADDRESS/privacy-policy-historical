		<h3>3.1 Log Files</h3>
		
		<p>
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. </p>

		<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but the ability for our service to provide accurate personaliztion for you will be limited. </p>

		<h3>3.3 Third Party Search Engines</h3>
		
		<p>
When you execute a query on selected search engines (currently Google, Yahoo and MSN), the Surf Canyon browser extension makes additional network connections to the search engine and execute additional queries.  The additional network connections may cause you to exceed a search engine's bandwidth limit more quickly.  The additional search engine queries may affect the search engine's own personalization algorithms.</p>

		<p>The ads that we deliver to users may be provided by our advertising partners.

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
