      <p>SurveyLot respects your privacy.

      <p>Any information you voluntarily enter on our web site is maintained by SurveyLot . to help us improve both the web site and product(s) advertised on the web site. </p>
      <p>In addition, we use "cookies" (as do the vast majority of other companies that do business on the World Wide Web) when you visit our site, which are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser. Information we collect and analyze via cookies includes the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system and platform, date and time of your visit, and cookie number. If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer, please review the options listed in the Help portion of the toolbar on your computer. The toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. </p>
      <p>SurveyLot periodically sends e-mail offers to its web site visitors on behalf of other businesses. By providing information on this web site, you are agreeing to receive these periodic e-mail offers, which SurveyLot believes may be of interest to you as a consumer. If you do not wish to receive e-mail offers from us, please be sure to scroll down to the bottom of the first e-mail you receive and click on the opt-out link provided, which will remove your e-mail address from our database. You will then receive no further e-mail communications from us.
