<h2><a name="1">1.</a> <strong><strong>Commitment; Applicability</strong></strong> </h2>
<p>Survey Sampling International, LLC (“<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SSI</span></strong>”) is a global provider of sampling solutions for survey research, providing clients with access to consumer and business-to-business respondents via internet, telephone (both fixed/landline and wireless/mobile), postal, and multi-mode methodologies. SSI also offers value-added services including data processing, data collection, offline data analysis, consulting, programming and hosting services. SSI serves a vast array of for-profit and not-for profit businesses, universities, and governmental agencies and departments. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to SSI’s commitment to provide the highest standard of actionable marketing intelligence, SSI is committed to protecting the privacy and security of all Personal Information (as defined herein) collected or received by SSI. SSI strives to conform its privacy practices with applicable international, national, Federal, state and/or local laws, codes, and regulations; and the industry codes, standards, rules, and regulations of various market and opinion research professional associations, including, without limitation, the ICC/ESOMAR International Code on Market and Social Research and the Code of Standards and Ethics for Survey Research of the Council of American Survey Research Organizations, with whom SSI is a member (collectively "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Applicable Laws and Codes</span></strong>"). Panel membership and/or participation in any survey or study offered, provided, hosted, or administered by SSI (individually a “<strong>Survey</strong>” and collectively “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Surveys</span></strong>”) is completely voluntary. All references to SSI in this Privacy Policy include SSI’s parents, subsidiaries and affiliates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SSI complies with the United States (“<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">US</span></strong>”) - European Union (“<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EU</span></strong>”) Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from EU member countries. SSI has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>This Privacy Policy applies to</strong>: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Members of SSI’s panels and subpanels, including, without limitation, SurveySpot Research Panel, Opinion Outpost Panel, OpinionWorld Research Panel, Choozz Research Panel, and Your Voice Research Panel (individually each a “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panel</span></strong>” and collectively “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panels</span></strong>”); </li>

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#top">top</a> </p>
<h2><a name="2">2.</a> <strong>Types of Information Collected; Collection Process; Data Storage</strong><strong></strong> </h2>
<p>For the purpose of this Privacy Policy: (i) "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personal Information</span></strong>" means any information identifiable with you, including, without limitation, first and last name, residential address, email address, telephone number(s) (home and/or cell), and date of birth; (ii) “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Demographic Information</span></strong>” includes, without limitation, marital status, income range, ethnicity, employment status, hobbies, interests and product ownership; (iii) “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Survey Data</span></strong>” means responses to survey questions; and (iv) “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information</span></strong>” means Personal Information, Demographic Information and Survey Data. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SSI collects Information through fair and lawful means. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SSI collects Personal Information and Demographic Information from Panel members during and after registration for membership with a Panel. The collection of Personal Information and Demographic Information after registration for membership with a Panel occurs in various ways, including, without limitation, during participation in a Survey. The disclosure of Information by Panel members is voluntary. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SSI collects Personal Information and Demographic Information from non-Panel members prior to and during participation in a Survey. The disclosure of Information by non-Panel members is voluntary. SSI retains Personal Information collected by SSI from non-Panel members to fulfill incentives and rewards and to improve user experience. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SSI may obtain Personal Information and Demographic Information of prospective Survey respondents or Panel members from vendors or partners. Prior to obtaining Personal Information from a vendor or partner, SSI requires written assurances that: (i) the data subjects have consented to have their Personal Information listed or compiled by the vendor or partner; and (ii) the vendor or partner has the right to disclose the Personal Information to SSI and to allow SSI to use the Personal Information for the specific purpose(s) for which it was disclosed by the vendor or partner. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SSI engages third parties to recruit individuals for Survey participation and for joining a Panel. Recruitment includes, without limitation, the third party placing banner ads or links on its website(s) and/or the website(s) of its affiliate(s). The banner ads or links provide an individual with the opportunity to join a Panel and/or participate in a Survey. The collection of Personal Information by such a third party does not constitute collection by SSI and this Privacy Policy does not cover such collection. This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information only when SSI actually receives or collects the Personal Information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SSI may collect the Internet Protocol Address (the "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IP Address</span></strong>") that is publicly available on your computer. The IP Address is not collected for the purpose of tracking or monitoring online activity. SSI collects, uses, maintains, secures, and discloses IP Addresses in accordance with Applicable Laws and Codes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Survey Data is collected from Panel members and non-Panel members during Survey participation. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>All Information collected or received by SSI is stored in the US. By joining a Panel, participating in a Survey, or otherwise disclosing Information to SSI, you hereby explicitly consent to SSI’s collection and storage of your Information in the US. </strong></p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a> </p>
<h2><a name="3">3.</a> Tell-A-Friend<strong></strong> </h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Where applicable and if you choose to use SSI’s Tell-A-Friend referral program, you will need to provide the first and last name and email address for your friend. SSI will send a one-time email inviting your friend to join a Panel. By using SSI’s Tell-A-Friend referral program, you acknowledge and agree you have the right and permission to disclose your friend’s Personal Information to SSI and you are initiating the email invitation to your friend voluntarily. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your friend may request the removal of the friend’s Personal Information from SSI’s database by: (i) clicking on the unsubscribe link contained in the email from SSI to the friend; or (ii) contacting SSI in accordance with Section 12.A. of this Privacy Policy. Any written removal request should include the friend’s first and last name, email address, and the words “remove me.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a> </p>
<h2><a name="4">4.</a> <strong><strong>Uses of Personal Information</strong></strong> </h2>
<p>SSI does not use Information for direct marketing or advertising purposes. All Information collected by SSI is collected in furtherance of, or in connection with, legitimate market research. SSI does not collect any Information under the guise of research for any non-research purpose. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Generally, SSI uses Personal Information and Demographic Information: (i) to communicate with you regarding Panel membership and/or Survey participation; (ii) to tailor Survey opportunities to you; (iii) to send you Survey opportunities; (iv) to comply with legal obligations, including, without limitation, complying with taxation requirements; (v) to administer and manage SSI’s incentive programs and fulfill your requests for incentives; (vi) to facilitate your entry into SSI’s sweepstakes and communicate with you regarding sweepstakes entries; (vii) to update SSI’s records; (viii) to comply with any data suppression obligations or requirements; and (ix) as otherwise permitted pursuant to this Privacy Policy or as otherwise authorized by you. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SSI may contact you to participate in surveys in one of several ways, including, without limitation, email survey invitations, “push” notifications or SMS text messages, or via telephone. By disclosing your email address you hereby expressly consent to receive email communications, including, without limitation, Survey invitations, promotion or incentive information, and notices required hereunder, from SSI and/or any Subcontractor (as defined herein). SSI does not send unsolicited commercial emails. SSI will only contact you for Survey participation via “push” notifications or SMS text messages and/or via telephone if you expressly agree to receive such communication(s).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Survey Data is used for legitimate scientifically based market research purposes. Survey Data helps organizations research opinions and attitudes about products and services. Generally, SSI provides Survey Data to clients in aggregate form, which does not permit the client or any other party or person to identify individual respondents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SSI may disclose Demographic Information to third parties in either single or aggregate summary form. Singular summary includes providing Demographic Information about a person to a third party without specifically identifying the person to the third party. For example, this summary does not contain personal information such as a name or e-mail address, nor does the combination of Demographic Information make it possible to identify the person. Aggregate summary includes providing Demographic Information about a group of persons without specifically identifying any person within the group. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certain Panel websites allow Panel members to access Facebook Connect to interact with friends and to share their recent activity on Facebook through various Facebook features including, without limitation, walls and news feeds. If you are logged into both a Panel Website and Facebook when you click the “Connect with Facebook” button, you will be prompted to merge your user profiles. If you are already logged into a Panel Website but are not logged into Facebook when you click the “Connect with Facebook” button you will be prompted to enter your Facebook login information or to “Sign up for Facebook." By proceeding, you are allowing SSI to access your information and you are agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use in connection with your use Panel websites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you attempt to access a Panel Website by clicking the “Sign in Using Facebook” button and you are not currently a member of a Panel, you will first be asked to enter your Facebook login details and will be given the option to register and join the applicable Panel. Once you are registered with the Panel and connect with Facebook, you will be able to automatically post your recent activity using Facebook’s features. You can edit privacy settings for the reviews that appear on Facebook or disconnect this service by visiting the Facebook Application Settings page.</p>

Prior to disclosing Personal Information to a Subcontractor, SSI requires the Subcontractor to enter into a written agreement restricting the Subcontractor’s use of Personal Information for only the purpose of providing services to SSI and/or SSI’s client and requiring the Subcontractor to ensure the security and confidentiality of the Personal Information. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -27pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt 45pt;">(viii)&nbsp;&nbsp;As otherwise permitted pursuant to this Privacy Policy or as otherwise authorized by you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please contact SSI in accordance with Section 12.A. of this Privacy Policy if you have any questions or concerns regarding the processing of Personal Information by SSI and/or its Subcontractors. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SSI may allow a client to collect Personal Information from Survey respondents; however, disclosure of Personal Information by respondents is strictly voluntary and, prior to the collection of Personal Information by the client, SSI requires the client to enter into a written agreement restricting the client’s use of Personal Information for only a market research related use and requiring the client to ensure the security and confidentiality of the Personal Information.&nbsp; </p>

Session cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your computer, indefinitely, until deleted. Personal Information is not stored or collected in the cookies used by SSI. You may disable and/or delete cookies via your browser and/or plug-in settings; however, this may: (1) decrease the functionality of the websites you visit; (2) limit your ability to use and view SSI’s web sites; and (3) limit your participation in Surveys. &nbsp; </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">B. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Online Ad Exposure Programs</span>.<a name="area3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a name="area3">SSI </a>may send you surveys related to advertisements you see online. The intent is to help advertisers understand what their ads communicate to internet users. Online ad exposure programs include: </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(i) a locally stored object (“<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LSO</span></strong>”), which can identify tags contained in on-line advertisements, being dropped onto a person’s Web browser; (ii) when the person views a Web page containing an online ad that has been tagged, the tag reads the LSO and provides SSI’s client with a unique identification number that does not personally identify the person; and (iii) SSI’s client supplies SSI with the identification number and requests that SSI provide the person associated with, or connected to, the identification number a survey related to the advertisement. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certain Web pages or Web-based advertisements that you view may be tracked by SSI’s client and/or its subcontractors or vendors and in connection with the tracking certain tracking data may be collected by SSI’s client and/or its subcontractors or vendors. No Personal Information should be collected in connection with online ad exposure programs. [Panel members may opt-out of participating in online ad exposure programs and the LSOs by going to “My Account” in the members’ area of the applicable Panel website and changing the setting called “Survey for online ad exposure.” Opting-out of online ad exposure programs will not delete any LSOs currently stored in your Web browser; LSOs must be deleted through your Web browser. Opting-out of SSI’s online ad exposure program will only apply to SSI’s program and will not affect or restrict third parties from deploying LSOs or similar technology onto your Web browser or remove you from participation in online tracking programs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Participation is strictly voluntary and subject to the individual consenting to participate in the online tracking program. SSI is not responsible for third party applications, technologies, or tracking cookies or for the information or data collected or used in connection with the applications, technologies, or cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<h2><a name="8">8.</a> <strong><strong>Digital Fingerprinting; Data Validation</strong></strong></h2>
<p>A. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Digital Fingerprinting</span>. In general, digital fingerprinting technologies assign a unique identifier to a user’s computer to identify and track the computer. SSI uses digital fingerprinting technology (the “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technology</span></strong>”) to assist SSI’s clients in ensuring the integrity of Survey results by identifying duplicate and fraudulent respondents. SSI may engage a third party or third parties to assist SSI in the implementation and use of the Technology. The Technology analyzes publicly available information and data obtained from a computer’s web browser and from other publicly available data points, including, without limitation, the technical settings of the computer, the characteristics of the computer, and the computer’s IP Address, to create a unique identifier assigned to the computer. The unique identifier does not contain any information or data that individually identifies the person who is assigned the unique identifier. In furtherance of SSI’s efforts to assist its clients in protecting and ensuring the integrity of Survey results, SSI: (i) may link or associate your unique identifier to you and any of your Personal Information; (ii) may share your unique identifier with SSI’s clients and with other sample or panel providers; and (iii) may receive or obtain a unique identifier linked to you from a third party, including, without limitation, a sample or panel provider or a client of SSI. Any unique identifier(s) received or obtained by SSI and linked to an identified or identifiable individual shall be protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SSI uses reasonable efforts to ensure that the Technology is safe, secure, and does not cause undue privacy or data security risks. SSI uses and distributes the Technology in a professional and ethical manner and in accordance with: (i) this Privacy Policy and (ii) Applicable Laws and Codes. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If SSI discovers or learns of any illegal or unethical conduct in connection with the use of the Technology, or that the Technology is being used in a manner inconsistent with the statements and/or disclosures made by SSI, SSI shall use reasonable efforts to restrict, limit, or prohibit the illegal or unethical conduct and to ensure the proper use and administration of the Technology. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Validation</span>. From time-to-time, SSI may engage a third party or third parties to validate Panel and non-Panel members. The purpose of the data validation is to assist SSI’s clients in ensuring the integrity of Survey results. For Panel members, validation may occur during and/or after registration with a Panel, including, without limitation, prior to, during, or after participation in a Survey. For non-Panel members, validation may occur prior to, during, or after participation in a Survey. The data validation process involves: (i) SSI disclosing or transferring Personal Information to a Subcontractor, (ii) the Subcontractor performing validation services, and (iii) the Subcontractor returning the Personal Information to SSI with any updates or corrections and, if applicable, with a validation score. SSI reserves the right to reject, deny, or terminate Panel membership, or to deny or reject Survey participation, if Personal Information is not validated to SSI’s satisfaction.</p>
