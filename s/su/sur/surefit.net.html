              will take responsibility for any additional unauthorized charges. 
              In addition, we'll do our very best to work with your credit card 
              company to assure that the problem is resolved with minimum hassle. 
              We'll stay with you every step of the way. It is our responsibility

              if unauthorized use of your credit or debit card occurs, it is your 
              responsibility to notify your card provider as stated in your agreement 
              with them.

              The Internet and the many ways in which it is changing our lives 
              has been in the news for the past few years. One of the biggest 
              concerns is Internet security because of the high increase in shopping 
              on the web and the strong use of credit cards. Anyone wanting to 
              take part in the growth of the web will at some point be using his 
              or her credit card online. Keeping abreast of fraudulent behavior 
              is always a good idea. Because of the fascination with this new 
              medium, and the growth that is taking place, Internet security will 
              always be a newsworthy item and an issue of public interest.

                SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), the industry standard security protocol 
                that the Sure Fit site uses to communicate with secure browsers 
                like Netscape and Internet Explorer. The SSL ensures that the 
                data you send is strongly encrypted and also ensures that the 
                site you're doing business with is the site you think it is. When 
                communicating with a secure server like ours, these browsers encrypt 
                the information you send in a way that is extremely difficult 
                for anyone else to decode. (You don't have to know whether your 
                browser supports secure transactions- if it doesn't, you won't 
                be able to complete the checkout process.)

                once the merchant receives your order. At Sure Fit, we take several 
                steps to keep things on our end as safe as possible. We do our 
                order processing on machines that aren't connected to the Internet, 
                so there's no danger of people gaining access to them. Finally, 
                we don't keep a copy of your credit card number on file. While 
                this is a minor inconvenience - whether ordering on the Internet 
                or by phone, you have to give us the number every time you order- 
                we believe it's the safest and most honest way to do business.

                  be a bit startling, making it appear that something bad has
