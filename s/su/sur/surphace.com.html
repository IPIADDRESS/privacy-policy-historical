	<h1>Surphace Privacy Policy</h1>
</div>

<p>Surphace I1c. ("Surphace") operates several websites including Surphace.com. In addition, Surphace's widgets display information generated at Surphace.com inside other websites Surphace does not operate. It is Surphace's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites or widgets.</p>

<h3>Website Visitors</h3>

<p>Like most website operators, Surphace collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, IP address, and the date and time of each visitor request. Surphace's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Surphace's visitors use its website and its widgets. From time to time, Surphace may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate (e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website) and as described below.</p>

<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

<p>Certain visitors to Surphace's websites choose to interact with Surphace in ways that require Surphace to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Surphace gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who request a widget to provide a name, email address, website url, and topic category. In each case, Surphace collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Surphace. Surphace does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities or prevent them from utilizing Surphace's widgets.</p>

<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>

<p>Surphace may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites and widgets. For instance, Surphace may monitor the most popular blog posts viewed within Surphace's widgets. Surphace may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Surphace does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

<p>Surphace discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Surphace's behalf or to provide services available within Surphace's websites or widgets, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Surphace's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Surphace will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Surphace discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Surphace believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Surphace, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Surphace website and have supplied your email address, Surphace may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Surphace and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users, and unless you ask us not to, we may or may not publish your name. Surphace takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Surphace uses cookies to help Surphace identify and track users of Surphace's websites and widgets and their website- or information-access preferences. Surphace visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Surphace's websites and widgets, with the drawback that certain features of Surphace's websites and widgets may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<p>Surphace and its advertisers may also use ad network providers to help present advertisements on Surphace, within Surphace widgets, and on other Web sites. These ad network providers may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to help present, better target, and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements using data gathered over time and across their networks of Web pages to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their audience. Surphace may share certain non-personally identifiable information about you as a Surphace user (such as age or zip code) with certain ad network providers to help them deliver more relevant advertisements through their ad networks. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by such ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not Surphace’s. Please visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/index.asp" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a> website for additional information about such providers and the options they may offer.</p>

<h3>How to Contact Us</h3>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns about Surphace’s Privacy Policy or its implementation, you may <a href="http://www.surphace.com/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>

<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Surphace may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Surphace's sole discretion. Surphace encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of Surphace's websites or widgets after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
