        <p>Survey4Income.com takes your privacy seriously, and has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to online privacy. Keep reading to learn more about our information gathering and dissemination practices, and our use of personally identifiable information. </p>
        <p>IP Addresses</p>
        <p>We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our site or web server, and for the general administration of our website.

        <p>Cookies</p>
        <p>Upon your first visit to this web site, a "cookie" is sent to your computer. A cookie is a tiny file that identifies you as a unique user. It stores personal preferences and user data, however, in no way does this tell us who you are. Survey4Income.com has two primary uses for its cookies.</p>
        <p>First, we use cookies to track special offers and promotions that may be presented to you as you navigate our website. This is done so that you are not presented with the same special offers and/or promotions over and over, or after you have indicated you are not interested.</p>
        <p>Secondly, we use cookies as part of our authentication system when you login to your account. If you select the "remember me" option when logging in, our site will set a cookie so that you do not have to login again the next time you visit Survey4Income.com.</p>
        <p>While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to this site always have the option of disabling cookies in their web browser. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.</p>
