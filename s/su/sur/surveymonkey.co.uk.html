<h2 class="InfoBarTitle">Information Collection</h2>
<p>You may view some areas of our site for free and register for a free account. We collect information such as your name, address, email. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.</p>
<p>You have the option to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender) to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site.</p>
<p>If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).</p>
<p>We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.</p>
<p>When you register for SurveyMonkey.com, you will receive a short welcome email. If you opt to receive newsletters from us, you will receive a monthly email. As a paid subscriber, you will receive emails regarding your account status and billing.</p>
<p>We will not use the information collected from your surveys in any way, shape, or form. In addition, any other material you provide us (including images, email addresses, etc.) will be held in the strictest confidence.</p>
<p>In addition, we do not collect personally identifiable information about you except when you specifically provide this information on a voluntary basis. We will make every effort to ensure that whatever information you provide will be maintained in a secure environment.</p>

<h2 class="InfoBarTitle">Log Files</h2>
<p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p>We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>

<h2 class="InfoBarTitle">Cookies</h2>
<p>"Cookies" are small text files a website can use to recognize repeat users. SurveyMonkey.com uses cookies to recognize visitors and more quickly provide personalized content or grant you unimpeded access to the website. With cookies enabled, you will not need to fill in password or contact information.</p>
<p>Information gathered through cookies also helps us measure use of our website. Cookie data allow us to track usage behavior and compile data that we can use to improve the site. This data will be used in aggregate form; no specific users will be tracked.</p>
<p>Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside of the Web site that he or she is visiting. You can easily turn off cookies. Most browsers have a feature that allows the user to refuse cookies or issues a warning when cookies are being sent. However, our site will not function properly without cookies. Enabling cookies ensures a smooth, efficient visit to our website.</p>
<p>We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistics to help us improve our site. We have no access or control over these cookies.</p>
<p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com">www.surveymonkey.com</a> only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third party.</p>

<h2 class="InfoBarTitle">Information Use</h2>
<p>SurveyMonkey.com reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics. We do this in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the website.</p>
<p>SurveyMonkey.com collects IP addresses for system administration and record keeping. Your IP address is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the World Wide Web. Our servers record incoming IP addresses. The IP addresses are analyzed only in aggregate; no connection is made between you and your computer's IP address. By tracking IP addresses, we can determine which sites refer the most people to SurveyMonkey.com. (Think of an IP address like your zip code; it tells us in general terms where you're from.)</p>

<h2 class="InfoBarTitle">Communications from the Site</h2>
<h3 class="InfoBarSubTitle">Service-related Announcements</h3>
<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.</p>
<p>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p>
<h3 class="InfoBarSubTitle">Customer Service</h3>
<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.</p>
<h3 class="InfoBarSubTitle">Newsletters</h3>
<p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the “Opting out” section.</p>
<h3 class="InfoBarSubTitle">Sending Emails on User’s Behalf</h3>
<p>We also send survey invitation emails on behalf of our customers. The customer's email list is stored on our system, but is not used by SurveyMonkey.com in any other way. The emails sent on our customer's behalf appear to come from the customer's email address.</p>
<h3 class="InfoBarSubTitle">Surveys or Contests</h3>
<p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).</p>
<p>We use this information to notify contest winners and to monitor site traffic or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys).</p>
<h3 class="InfoBarSubTitle">Testimonials</h3>
<p>We post testimonials from time to time. We always receive permission to post prior to posting.</p>

<h2 class="InfoBarTitle">Sharing Information</h2>
<h3 class="InfoBarSubTitle">Service Providers</h3>
<p>We use other third parties to provide billing services on our site. When you purchase a service from us, we will share contact and credit card information as necessary for the third party to provide that service.</p>
<p>These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose including their own marketing purposes.</p>
<h2 class="InfoBarTitle">Opting Out</h2>
<p>Upon request, SurveyMonkey.com will allow any user to opt out of our monthly newsletter. You can contact us through our <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/HelpCenter/">Help Center</a> or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each promotional email sent to you including the newsletter.</p>

<h2 class="InfoBarTitle">Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by SurveyMonkey.com. Please be aware that we, SurveyMonkey.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.</p>
<p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.</p>

We will respond to any request for access within 30 days.</p>

<h2 class="InfoBarTitle">Legal Disclaimer</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site</p>

<h2 class="InfoBarTitle">General Security Policy</h2>
<p>SurveyMonkey.com is aware of your privacy concerns and strives to collect only as much data as is required to make your SurveyMonkey experience as efficient and satisfying as possible, in the most unobtrusive manner as possible.</p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at <a href="mailto:support@surveymonkey.com">support@surveymonkey.com</a></p>

<h2 class="InfoBarTitle">Changes in this Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a prominent notice on our home page.</p>
