		    <p align="left">Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are mentioned below.

		    <p align="left">For example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of the trading losses are material points, which can also adversely affect trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the market in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results. </p>
