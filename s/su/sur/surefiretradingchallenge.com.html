		          site are governed by the laws of the Republic of South Africa. If a dispute
		          arises under this Policy (agreement) we agree to first try to resolve it

		        <p align="left">Company Details</p>

		          Suite 509, Private Bag X503<br>

		        <p align="left">By becoming a member of this website or using this website you agree that
		          you unconditionally accept this disclaimer agreement.</p>
		        <p align="left">You further agree that Old Tree Publishing (Pty) Ltd, its Directors and
		          representatives can not be held liable for any loses, injury or damages the

		        <p align="left">Warning!</p>
		        <p align="left">Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of
		          which are mentioned below. No representation is being made that any account
		          will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In
		          fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical
		          performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any<br>
		          particular trading program.</p>
		        <p align="left">One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are
		          generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical
		          trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record
		          can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading.</p>
		        <p align="left">For example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular
		          trading program in spite of the trading losses are material points, which
		          can also adversely affect trading results. There are numerous other factors
		          related to the market in general or to the implementation of any specific
		          trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of<br>
		          hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect
	          actual trading results.</p>
