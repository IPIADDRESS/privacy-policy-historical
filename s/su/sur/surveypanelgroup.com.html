<p class="main" align="justify">Effective Date January 1, 2004 

</p><p class="main" align="justify">This statement discloses the privacy practices for the SurveyPanelGroup.com website. By visiting SurveyPanelGroup.com, you are accepting the practices described herein. Because SurveyPanelGroup wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and notify you of the following: 

</p><p class="gen_topic" align="justify" style="font-size:15pt">What information do we collect?

</p><p class="main" align="justify">The information we collect helps us ensure that our services are best designed to meet your needs. We receive and store any information that you enter on any registration page. Typically these will be registration forms for contests, surveys or other promotions. If you are giving us information in order to participate in a survey, contest or other promotion, your participation is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. If some information is required and some is optional, we will identify the required information. We collect both contact and other information.

</p><p class="main" align="justify">A. Contact Information

</p><p class="main" align="justify">Contact information consists of the information that we can use to contact you if, for example, you win one of the contests or promotions sponsored by SurveyPanelGroup and/or its affiliates and partners. This consists of your name, your e-mail address, IP address and possibly your mailing address, telephone and facsimile number. Visitors who supply SurveyPanelGroup.com with their postal address may receive periodic postal mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. They may also receive mailings from other reputable companies. 

</p><p class="main" align="justify">B. Other Information

</p><p class="main" align="justify">Profile data also is collected at our site. Depending on the specific SurveyPanelGroup products for which a user ("User") registers, various information will be requested. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience through our interest-focused e-mails. By obtaining this information, we can provide our Users with specific content that we think they might be interested in, according to their preferences and interests. The User may include only the information he or she feels comfortable including. However, the omission of certain information may limit the value of the experience for the User. As a result, the more information we have about a User, the more valuable the SurveyPanelGroup experience will be for that User. In addition, SurveyPanelGroup.com provides services for direct marketing applications including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation. 

</p><p class="main" align="justify">C. Under thirteen (13)

</p><p class="main" align="justify">SurveyPanelGroup.com does not intentionally collect the personal information of children under the age of thirteen (13).

</p><p class="gen_topic" align="justify" style="font-size:15pt">How is User information used?

</p><p class="main" align="justify">A. Information that you provide

</p><p class="main" align="justify">SurveyPanelGroup does not send unsolicited or "spam" e-mail. We use User information in a number of ways, including:

</p><p class="main" align="justify">1) to send personalized, targeted information to the User in the form of e-mail messages and/or direct mail;<br>
2) to send targeted advertising that allows us to provide our service at no or little cost to the Users;<br>
3) to send promotions and coupons based on their interests;<br>
4) to contact Users for feedback and surveys;<br>
5) to monitor and improve its internal operations, as well as to ensure that it properly performs the services requested and bills properly where appropriate; and<br>
6) to send Users other information about SurveyPanelGroup and/or its products.

</p><p class="main" align="justify">When you register with SurveyPanelGroup, you may receive offers from us or our marketing partners. Our marketing partners may use this information to make offers to you in your areas of interest or other offers. Our marketing partners wishing to contact you either give their e-mail message to us and we deliver it to you, or we provide your contact information to them so they can deliver messages directly to you. It is solely at your discretion if you choose to provide additional personally identifiable information to a marketer by making a purchase, requesting additional information, or communicating directly with the company or organization after using its website. We may also use outside companies to execute the marketing campaigns on our behalf or on behalf of some of our marketing partners. We will share your e-mail name &amp; other information that you give us that is necessary for these third parties to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purposes of providing these services.

</p><p class="main" align="justify">B. Automatic Information ("Cookies")

</p><p class="main" align="justify">A cookie is a piece of data stored on the User's hard drive containing information about the User.
