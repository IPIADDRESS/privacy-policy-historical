                to any other party unless we are required to do so by law. The 
                minimum information required to register is your gender, age, 
                and zip code. Providing your e-mail address, although optional, 
                would allow us to communicate directly with you when responding

              <p align="left"><span class="bold-heading">Cookies </span><br>
                <span class="body-new">A “cookie” is a small amount 
                of data that can be sent to your browser and stored on your computer’s 
                hard drive. Cookies are often used to track Internet usage. To 
                avoid the necessity of re-registering each time you use your Player 
                and to maintain your personalized features, we assign you a random 
                number when you initially register, which may be placed in a cookie. 
                This technique allows SurferNETWORK to count and keep track of 
                unique listeners using our service to fulfill our counting obligations 
                to broadcasters and advertisers, without ever revealing your identity. 
                Advertisers broadcasting via SurferNETWORK may use their own cookies 
                for similar purposes, but we do not provide them access to your 
                personal information. </span></p>
