						<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

						<!-- begin -->
						<h3>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.</h3>
						<p>
						Effective Date: January 1, 2011
						</p>

						<p>

						By accessing or otherwise using this www.surething.com site, you agree to be bound contractually by this Privacy Policy.
						</p>

						<h3>
						1.	Privacy Statement; Collection of Personal Information.
						</h3>

						<p>

							1.1	MicroVision Development, Inc.  ("MVD") owns and operates this website business.  All references to "we", "us", this "website" or this "site" shall be construed to mean MVD.
						</p>

						<p>
							1.2	We understand that visitors to this website are concerned about the privacy of information. The following describes our privacy policy regarding information, including personal information, that we collect through this website.
						</p>

						<h3>
						2.	Modification of Privacy Policy.
						</h3>

						<p>

						We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, and without prior notice, by posting an amended Privacy Policy that is always accessible by clicking on the "Privacy Policy" link on this site's home page. Your continued use of this site indicates your acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy.  You should check the Privacy Policy through this link periodically for modifications by clicking on the link provided near the top of the Privacy Policy for a listing of material modifications and their effective dates.  Regarding personal information, if any modifications are materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of the personal information previously disclosed by you, we will obtain your consent before implementing such revisions with respect to such information.
						</p>

						<h3>
						3.	Collection of Anonymous, Passive Information.
						</h3>

						<p>
						We reserve the right to monitor your use of this site.  As you navigate through this site, certain anonymous information may be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream).  The following is a listing and a brief explanation of passive information collection methodologies which we may use from time to time to better understand how this site is being used.
						</p>

						<p>

							3.1	A "cookie" is a text file that this site sends to your browser in the form of a text file The information generated by the cookie about your use of this site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored.  Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but they usually can be modified to decline cookies if you prefer; however, certain features of this site might not work without cookies.
						</p>

						<p>
							3.2	"Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are used to improve navigation, block visitors from providing information where inappropriate (the site "remembers" previous entries of country of origin that were outside the specified parameters and blocks subsequent changes), and collect aggregate statistical information on the site. They are erased once you exit your Web browser or otherwise turn off your computer.
						</p>

						<p>
							3.3	"Persistent" cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided, helping to determine what areas of the site you may find most valuable, and customizing the site based on your preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent cookies placed by this site in your computer do not hold personal information.
						</p>

						<p>

							3.4	You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can decide each time whether to accept it. To learn more about cookies and how to specify your preferences, please search for "cookie" in the "Help" portion of your browser.
						</p>

						<p>
							3.5	An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in many cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer). The IP address can be used to diagnose problems with a server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to a site, and administer and improve the site.
						</p>

						<p>
							3.6	"Internet tags" (also known as Web Beacons, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) tell the website server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer. Tags may be placed both on online advertisements that bring people to the site and on different pages of the site. Such tags indicate how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted.
						</p>

						<p>

							3.7	"Navigational data" (log files, server logs, and clickstream data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the site, market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors.
						</p>

						<h3>
						4.	Use and Sharing of Anonymous, Passive Information.
						</h3>

						<p>
						This site may make full use of passively collected anonymous information, including without limitation the right to use such information to provide better service to site visitors, customize the site based on your preferences, compile and analyze statistics and trends, and otherwise administer and improve this site for your use.  We reserve the right to share this anonymous, passive information in aggregated form.
						</p>

						<h3>

						5.	1st Party Behavioral Ads.
						</h3>

						<p>
						We reserve the right to use anonymous, passive information about your visits to this and other websites (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) for purposes of serving our ads that are targeted to your interests ("1st Party Behavioral Ads").  We do not share anonymous, passive information collected on this site with third parties for purposes of serving 1st Behavioral Ads.  These 1st Behavioral Ads do not identify you personally.  Instead, they associate your behavioral data on visited sites with your IP address, so that the ads your computer sees on this site are more likely to be relevant to your interests.  1st Party Behavioral Ads require that that you be served with a cookie containing a tracking code.  You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser; however, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this site.
						</p>

						<h3>
						6.	Use of 3rd Party Cookies.
						</h3>

						<p>

						We reserve the right to use web analytics services provided by third parties.  These services use 3rd party cookies to collect anonymous, passive information about your use of this site (see explanation of cookies in Collection of Anonymous, Passive Information above).  We use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of this site, compiling reports on website activity, and providing other services.  These web analytics services may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on the service's behalf.
						</p>

						<h3>
						7.	Collection of Personal Information; Categories.
						</h3>

						<p>
							7.1	We will ask you for personal information when you sign up for any specific benefit or purpose that requires registration.  Personal information that we collect may vary with the each registration, and it may include one or more of the following categories:  name, physical address, an email address, phone number, and credit card information including credit card number, expiration date, and billing address.
						</p>

						<p>

							7.2	We do NOT tie or link your personal information to anonymous, passive information with persistent identifiers.  For example, we would not tie or link your email address (personal information) with information collected by a cookie regarding the length of time you visit our site (anonymous, passive information).
						</p>

						<h3>
						8.	Use And Sharing of Personal Information: General Policy And Exceptions.
						</h3>

						<p>
						Our general policy (subject to the exceptions listed below) is that we will use your personal information only for: the performance of the services or transaction for which it was given, our private, internal reporting for this site, and security assessments for this site, and we will not share, sell, or rent your personal information to others.

						</p>

						<p>
							8.3	Enforcement; Legal Process.  We reserve the right to transfer such information if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary (i) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, or (ii) to investigate or enforce violations of our rights or the security of this site.
						</p>

						<p>

							8.4	Third Parties For Direct Marketing; Your California Privacy Rights.  We may provide you with the opportunity to receive promotional offers from specifically identified third-parties through their direct marketing efforts, but only if you explicitly consent (opt-in) to receive each offer.  If you explicitly consent (opt-in), your personal information will be shared only with the specifically identified third-party to enable them to provide you with the offer you have requested, and then only in connection with that specific promotion and not on a continual basis.
