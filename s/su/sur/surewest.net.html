   SureWest - Privacy Policy</span></b> <br>
   <p class="text"><b>Our 
    commitment to privacy</b></p>
   <p class="text">The SureWest Communications Privacy 
    Policy was developed as an extension of our 
    commitment to combine the highest-quality products 
    and services with the highest level of integrity 
    in dealing with our clients and partners. This 
    privacy policy applies to all SureWest Communications 
    family of companies.
    <!--, including SureWest Communications,

                                  (SureWest Payphones, Roseville Telephone Museum).-->
   </p>
   <p class="text">The policy is designed to assist 
    you in understanding how we collect, use and 
    safeguard the personal information you provide 
    to us and to assist you in making informed decisions 
    when using our site and our products and services. 
    This statement will be continuously assessed 
    against new technologies, business practices 
    and our customers' needs.</p>
   <p class="text"><b>What information do we collect?</b></p>
   <p class="text">When you visit our website you 
    may provide us with two types of information: 
    personal information you knowingly choose to 
    disclose that is collected on an individual 
    basis and website use information collected 
    on an aggregate basis as you and others browse 
    our website.</p>
   <p class="text"><b>1. Personal information you 
    choose to provide</b></p>
   <p class="text"><b>Credit card information</b></p>
   <p class="text">This section applies when online 
    credit card payment options are available through 
    SureWest Communications company websites. If 
    you choose to purchase products or services 
    from us or our partners, you may need to give 
    personal information and authorization to obtain 
    information from various credit services. For 
    example, you may need to provide the following 
    information:</p>
   <ul class="text">
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Mailing address</li>
    <li>E-mail address</li>
    <li>Credit card number</li>
    <li>Home and business phone number</li>
    <li>Other personal information (for example, 
     your mother's maiden name)</li>
   </ul>
   <p class="text"><b>E-mail information</b></p>
   <p class="text">If you choose to correspond further 
    with us through e-mail, we may retain the content 
    of your e-mail messages together with your e-mail 
    address and our responses. We provide the same 
    protections for these electronic communications 
    that we employ in the maintenance of information 
    received by mail and telephone.</p>
   <p class="text"><b>2. Website use information</b></p>
   <p class="text"> Similar to other commercial websites, 
    our website may utilize a standard technology 
    called "cookies" (see explanation 
    below: <span class="standardlink"><a href="#cookies">What 
    are cookies?</a></span>) and web server logs 
    to collect information about how our website 
    is used. Information gathered through cookies 
    and web server logs may include the date and 
    time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent 
    at our website, and the websites visited just 
    before and after our website. This information 
    is collected on an aggregate basis. None of 
    this information is associated with you as an 
    individual. </p>
   <p class="text"><b>How we use the information 
    that you provide to us</b></p>
   <p class="text">Broadly speaking, we use personal 
    information for purposes of administering our 
    business activities, providing customer service 
    and making available other products and services 
    to our customers and prospective customers.</p>
   <p class="text">Occasionally, we may also use 
    the information we collect to notify you about 
    important changes to our website, new services 
    and special offers we think you will find valuable. 
    The lists used to send you product and service 
    offers are developed and managed under our traditional 
    corporate standards designed to safeguard the 
    security and privacy of our customers' personal 
    information. Upon registering for your online 
    account, you will be given the opportunity to 
    indicate whether or not you wish to receive 
    these offers. If you change your mind later, 
    your account preferences are available through 
    your online account and can be adjusted at any 
    time.</p>
   <p class="text"><b><a name="cookies"></a>What 
    are cookies?</b></p>
   <p class="text">Cookies are a standard feature 
    of web browser software that allow web servers 
    to recognize the computer used to access a website. 
    Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored 
    by a user's web browser on the user's hard drive. 
    Cookies store select pieces of information a 
    user accesses on a web page to simplify subsequent 
    interactions with that website by the same user 
    or to use the information to streamline the 
    user's transactions on related web pages. This 
    makes it easier for a user to move from web 
    page to web page and to complete commercial 
    transactions over the Internet. Cookies should 
    make your online experience easier and more 
    personalized. </p>
   <p class="text">Cookies help us collect important 
    business and technical statistics. The information 
    in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed 
    by users to our website as they move from one 
    page to another; this helps us improve our navigation 
    and make it easier for you to find things. Web 
    server logs allow us to count how many people 
    visit our website and evaluate our website's 
    visitor capacity. We do not use these technologies 
    to capture your individual e-mail address or 
    any personally identifying information about 
    you, although they do permit us to display information 
    or advertisements most likely to be of interest 
    to you. </p>
   <p><strong>&nbsp;Sharing information with affiliates</strong></p>
   <p>Where not prohibited by law,&nbsp;and normally&nbsp;where a   customer has accounts with more than one of our&nbsp;affiliates, we may   share&nbsp;information across affiliates&nbsp;to better assist us in&nbsp;providing services to   you.&nbsp; With some affiliates, we&nbsp;may&nbsp;provide for&nbsp;written permission to do so in   our contract with you.&nbsp; Our contracts for some services may be somewhat more   restrictive.&nbsp; We&nbsp;seek to comply with&nbsp;all&nbsp;applicable&nbsp;laws, rules and regulations   in this area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
   <p><strong>No sharing of information with third   parties</strong></p>
   <p dir="ltr">We do not sell, trade or disclose to third parties any   customer identifiable information derived from the registration for or use of   our online services (including customer names and addresses) without your   consent (except as required by subpoena, search warrant or other legal process,   or to help you in the case of potential harm to you or members of your   household,&nbsp;or in other exceptional cases where we conclude in our discretion   that such disclosure would be acceptable to you.)&nbsp; Again, in some cases, our   contracts for some services may be more restrictive.&nbsp; When we use other agents,   contractors or companies to perform services on our behalf, we advise them   that&nbsp;they are to&nbsp;protect confidential information and not disclose it except in   limited circumstances.&nbsp; Again, we seek to comply with all applicable laws, rules   and regulations in this area.</p>
   <p dir="ltr">Some of the pages on our site may&nbsp;contain links to   other sites and to other companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;When&nbsp;you click on those links, you will be connected   to pages that are on another site, operated by another entity, and&nbsp;not subject   to SureWest's site policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do   business with one of these other companies, you will be providing information   directly to that firm, and your relationship will be exclusively with that firm,   not with SureWest.&nbsp; Any information you provide to that firm will be subject to   their information disclosure and other policies.&nbsp; We cannot make any   representations about the practices and policies of these companies, and we do   not warrant their products or services.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Notice of new services and changes</b></p>
   <p class="text">Occasionally, we may also use 
    the information we collect to notify you about 
    important changes to our website, new services 
    and special offers we think you will find valuable.</p>
   <p class="text">As our customer, you will be given 
    the opportunity to indicate whether or not you 
    wish to receive these offers when you register 
    for your online account. If you change your 
    mind later, your account preferences are available 
    through your online account and can be adjusted 
    at any time.</p>
   <p class="text"><b>How do we secure information 
    transmissions?</b></p>
   <p class="text">When you send confidential personal 
    credit card information to us on our website, 
    a secure server software which we have licensed 
    encrypts all information you input before it 
    is delivered to us. The information is scrambled 
    en route and decoded once it reaches our web 
    servers.</p>
   <p class="text">Other e-mail that you send us 
    may not be secure unless we advise you that 
    security measures will be in place prior to 
    your transmitting the information. For that 
    reason, we ask that you do not send confidential 
    information such as social security or account 
    numbers to us through an unsecured e-mail.</p>
   <p class="text"><b>How do we protect your information?</b></p>
   <ul class="text">
    <li><i><b>Information security</b></i><br>
     We utilize encryption/security software to 
     safeguard the confidentiality of personal 
     information we collect from unauthorized access 
     or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration 
     or destruction.</li>
    <li><i><b>Evaluation of information protection 
     practices</b></i><br>
     Periodically, our operations and business 
     practices are reviewed for compliance with 
     corporate policies and procedures governing 
     the security, confidentiality and quality 
     of our information.</li>
    <li><b><i>Employee access, training and expectations</i></b><br>
     Our corporate values, ethical standards, policies 
     and practices are committed to the protection 
     of customer information as described in this 
     policy. In general, our business practices 
     limit employee access to confidential information, 
     and limit the use and disclosure of such information 
     to authorized persons, processes and transactions. </li>
   </ul>
   <p class="text"> <b>How can you access and correct 
    your information?</b></p>
   <p class="text">Log in to your online account 
    and click the link to update your online account 
    information. You can then make adjustments to 
    your account information and submit the corrections, 
    which will be automatically updated in our database.</p>
   <p class="text">Currently, you can only use your 
    online account to update the information associated 
    directly with your online account. To update 
    your regular account information with any of 
    our family of companies (such as your mailing 
    address, primary customer name, which features 
    or services you subscribe to, or other details), 
    call the customer service number shown on your 
    bill.</p>
   <p class="text"><b>Do we disclose information 
    to outside parties?</b></p>
   <p class="text">We may provide aggregate information 
    about our customers, sales, website traffic 
    patterns and related website information to 
    our affiliates or reputable third parties, but 
    this information will not include personally 
    identifying data, except as otherwise provided 
    in this privacy policy.</p>
   <p class="text"><b>What about legally compelled 
    disclosure of information?</b></p>
   <p class="text">We may disclose information when 
    legally responsible to do so: under court or 
    legal order, or when we, in good faith, believe 
    that the law requires it for the protection 
    of our legal rights.</p>
   <p class="text"><b>What about other websites linked 
    to our website?</b></p>
   <p class="text">We are not responsible for the 
    practices employed by websites linked to or 
    from our website nor the information or content 
    contained therein. Often links to other websites 
    are provided solely as pointers to information 
    on topics that may be useful or of interest 
    to the users of our website.</p>
   <p class="text">Please remember that when you 
    use a link to go from our website to another 
    website, our privacy policy is no longer in 
    effect. Your browsing and interaction on any 
    other website, including websites which have 
    a link on our website, is subject to that website's 
    own rules and policies. Please read over those 
    rules and policies before proceeding.</p>
   <p class="text"><b>Your consent</b></p>
   <p class="text">By using our website you consent 
    to our collection and use of your personal information 
    as described in this privacy policy. If we change 
    our privacy policies and procedures, we will 
    post those changes on our website to keep you 
    aware of what information we collect, how we 
    use it and under what circumstances we may disclose 
  it.</p></td>
