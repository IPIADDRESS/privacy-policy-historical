				  Surveys.co.uk is keen to ensure   that the principals of our opt-in when your data is collected are clearly   explained: <br>
				  The information you volunteer to Surveys.co.uk and that DLG holds   about you, will be shared and used to appropriately target offers and marketing   communication from Surveys.co.uk, from our clients, from our selected 3rd party   partners (including Intela Ltd) and from DLG and its other brands. Marketing   communication may be through email, mailing, telemarketing, SMS/MMS and   door-to-door canvassing, depending on which contact channel information you have   volunteered. You may also receive marketing calls via automated voice broadcast   over the telephone.<br>
				  Some questions on our consumer surveys are specific to   our named sponsors, and by expressing a positive interest in their brand or   products you are also agreeing to contact from them.

You may   subsequently need to contact these named sponsor brands directly if in the   future you decide to opt-out of further communication from these brands. <br>

				  Rules for data protection   are different in the US and other overseas countries to the European Economic   Area.

				  Surveys.co.uk collects information   about you when you register on the site or register for a promotion.   Surveys.co.uk also collects information about your preferences in relation to   the site by analyzing site traffic, which includes the use of cookies. Cookies   are pieces of computer code which are stored on your computer, and which allow   Surveys.co.uk to recognise the fact that you have visited our site previously.   Most browsers can be altered to prevent your computer from accepting cookies,   although this may mean that some of the features of this site will not work   properly.<br>
				  An Internet protocol ("IP") address, is a set of numbers that is   automatically assigned to your computer when you access the Internet. Web   servers identify your computer by the IP address assigned to it during your   online session. When you request pages from Surveys.co.uk, our servers log your   IP address. Surveys.co.uk does not normally link IP addresses to anything   personally identifiable, which means that your session will be logged, but you   remain anonymous to us; however we can and will use IP addresses to identify a   user when we feel it is necessary to investigate misuse of the Site, its users,   or to cooperate with law enforcement.</p>
