<h3>Last updated: June, 2003</h3>

<p class="justify">At SurveySite Market Research we are committed to protecting your privacy. SurveySite Market Research is a professional online market research firm that conducts quantitative surveys and qualitative research discussions online. We conduct research globally, with research respondents/participants from around the world. We also build and maintain a large online consumer Web Panel. Our primary business is to conduct research studies in order to provide insights to our clients, ensuring that the personal identity of those participating in our surveys/research discussions is protected.  Results from surveys and research discussions are not linked to the individual identity of the respondents or discussion participants without the informed consent of respondents/participants.</p>

<p class="justify">By using this site, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.</p>

<h3>Information We Gather On This Web Site</h3>

<p class="justify">As a standard policy, we do not automatically collect personally identifiable information such as your name, address or e-mail address during visits to this Web site. Personally identifiable information is only collected with your full knowledge and permission, such as for the purpose of joining the Web Panel, or applying for a job. In registering to join the SurveySite Web Panel, a user is asked to provide contact information (such as name, e-mail address and browsing habits). This information is used to contact Web Panel participants about research projects and to select appropriate people to participate in the research.  When registering to join the Panel, it is optional to provide other demographic information, such as income level and age. While optional, this information is helpful in our being able to contact people about research that would best match their interests.</p>

<p class="justify">Under any circumstances where we do retain personal information, it is only used for internal purposes and is never sold or otherwise transferred to an outside company.  </p>

<p class="justify">Our Web server recognizes your Internet service provider and/or referrer's domain name, IP address and the identity of your Internet browser. This non-personal information helps SurveySite Market Research to determine the total number of visitors to its Web site and to individual pages.</p>

<h3>Choice/Opt Out</h3>
<p class="justify">Participants in our Web Panel who no longer want to participate in online surveys can unsubscribe by e-mailing us. Our team will delete Panel members permanently from our databases and they will not be asked to participate in any more research projects. To unsubscribe from the Web Panel, please notify us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribepanel@surveysite.com">unsubscribepanel@surveysite.com</a>.</p>



<h3>Participation in online surveys</h3>

<p class="justify">Separate to this Web site, SurveySite Market Research conducts online surveys and the following are the guiding principles by which we conduct our business:</p>

<ol>
<li class="justify">All of the information collected in our surveys will only be used for research purposes.</li>
<li class="justify">We will never sell or otherwise transmit anyone's name or other personal information to a mailing list.</li>
<li class="justify">The only personally identifiable information we may use is an e-mail address in order to contact, for example, prize winners in a sweepstake draw; or if a person has provided permission for us to re-contact them for other purposes, such as to take part in a follow-up survey or to join an online research Panel.</li>
<li class="justify">For all other purposes only aggregate data are used or data where all personally identifiable or sensitive data have been removed.</li>
<li class="justify">We take all steps to protect security and integrity of the information that respondents/participants provide.</li>
<li class="justify">Respondents/participants have the right to check the data that have been collected and to correct inaccurate personal information.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Why we use cookies</h3>

<p class="justify">With interactive research, it is often necessary for us to associate short pieces of text, also known as "cookies," with users' Web browsers. A cookie allows us to recognize a Web browser, but does not give any personal identifying information about the user. Our most common use is to avoid inviting someone using that Web browser to take the same survey twice.</p>

<h3>Correcting/Updating Personal Information</h3>

<p class="justify">If you have submitted personally identifiable information that subsequently changes (such as e-mail address) we provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data. This can be done by e-mailing our Customer Support Department at <a href="mailto:changeinfo@surveysite.com">changeinfo@surveysite.com.</a></p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p class="justify">SurveySite Market Research is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, both online and offline. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal information over the Internet, such as your e-mail address, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>

 
<h3>Changes to the Privacy Statement</h3>

<p class="justify">We may occasionally update this Privacy Statement.  When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the Privacy Statement. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Statement to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect.</p>

<p class="justify">SurveySite Market Research welcomes your comments regarding this Privacy Statement. If you believe that SurveySite Market Research has not adhered to this Statement, please contact us by e-mail or postal mail, and we will make every reasonable effort to promptly determine and remedy the problem.</p>
