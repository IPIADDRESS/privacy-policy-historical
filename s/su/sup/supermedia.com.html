It does not apply to the offline activities of SuperMedia or any of its affiliates. If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy, please contact us at spinfo@SuperMedia.com.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Privacy Policy Effective Date / Updates </strong><br>
  This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 4, 2010, and was last updated April 22, 2010. Our business changes constantly. This Privacy Policy will change also, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of use. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the version of the Privacy Policy containing such changes on This Website. If the changes are material, we also will notify you by means of a notice on our home page. You should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. </p>
<p><br><strong>What information does the Web site gather? </strong><br>
When you visit This Website, you may provide information of two different types: <br>
• Anonymous statistics collected as you browse the site <br>
• Personal information you knowingly give us <br>
• Non-Personally identifiable information you knowingly Provide </p>
<p>Please be assured that we do not collect personal information about you from the Web site unless you provide it to us. This means that you can visit our Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself (such as your e-mail address). <br>
  You are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide.</p>
<p>As you browse the site, our web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via web server logs, we monitor statistics such as: </p>
<ul>
  <li>    How many people visit our site </li>
  <li> Which pages people visit on our site </li>
  <li> From which domains our visitors come (e.g., aol.com) </li>
  <li> Which browsers people use to visit our site </li>
</ul>
<p>None of this information is associated with you as an individual (see information about cookies below). We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and to make the Web site easier for you and other visitors to use.</p>
<p><br><strong>What about pages that ask for personal information?</strong><br>
When visitors supply information about themselves for a specific purpose, we use the information for that purpose (such as to provide the service or information the visitor has requested). For example, you may be asked to give us individual information to purchase a product or service, receive information and manage online account registration. The information may include your zip code, phone number, account number, billing account number, a credit card number, mother’s maiden name, e-mail address, organization URL, personal ID, password, security question &amp; answer, registration code and mailing address. </p>
<p>If you choose to use our Chat feature to receive online support, we may collect your email address, phone number, address, account number and/or customer number and any information you choose to submit that would allow us to resolve your issue. We would respond to you via the Live Chat dialogue box or via email depending on the issue and length of time required to resolve your concern. </p>
<p>When you sign-up for our Internet advertising service, your business information will be listed in the on-line directory of superpages.com and on other SuperMedia affiliate Web sites and partner Web sites, including but not limited to www.switchboard.com, www.BigBook, www.YellowBook.com and www.localsearch.com. If you choose to remove your free listing or advertising with us, you can contact Client Care at 866-558-0400, Monday-Friday, 7am to 8pm CST.</p>

<p><br><strong>What happens to information when I fill out registration forms? </strong><br>
The registration forms request accurate contact information (like name and e-mail address) and preferences that help us better serve you. Your name and e-mail address are used to send you service-related announcements and customer service information. These emails and information sent are not promotional in nature and, in general, you may not opt-out of these transactional emails. (See “Service Related Announcements,” below.) </p>

The page will appear as if you are on the original Web site (for example, SwitchBoard.com) when in fact you are on SuperMedia.com. Please note that This Website’s privacy policy governs the collection and use of information collected on This Website. Our privacy policy will be linked from these pages at all times.</p>
<p> <br>
  <strong>Does This Website send email to users of This Website? </strong><br>
SuperMedia may send you commercial email messages (unless you have chosen to opt-out of receiving them, with some exceptions, as explained below) and non-commercial email messages (which are not subject to opt-out, as explained below). For example, SuperMedia may send you emails to (a) conduct online surveys, (b) provide information regarding our company, information regarding our website(s), marketing information about products and services, and newsletters, and (c) confirm registrations and orders placed online and to otherwise communicate with you as a client or other user of our services. In addition, occasionally, we may use opt-in email lists from third parties to promote our latest specials. </p>
<p>
You may request not to receive (i.e., “opt-out” of receiving) commercial email messages (the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service) from us (on a category-by-category basis), by clicking on Update Your Email Preferences (or otherwise visiting the email campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the email campaign opt-out page. If you have previously opted out of receiving commercial email messages related to one or more categories, you may cancel your request to opt-out of (i.e., consent to receive commercial email messages from us related to) such categories (on a category-by-category basis) by clicking on Update Your Email Preferences (or otherwise visiting the email campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the email campaign opt-out page. </p>
<p>
Please note that we reserve the right to send emails to online users, including those who have opted out of receiving commercial email messages, to (a) facilitate, complete or confirm a commercial transaction the user has agreed to enter into with SuperMedia or participation in a program the user has selected; (b) provide warranty information, product recall information, or safety or security information with respect to a commercial product or service used or purchased by the user; (c) provide notification concerning a change in the terms or features of, notification of a change in the user’s standing or status with respect to, or at regular periodic intervals, account balance information or other type of account statement with respect to, a subscription, membership, account or comparable ongoing commercial relationship involving the ongoing purchase or use by the user of products or services offered by SuperMedia; (d) provide information directly related to an employment relationship or related benefit plan in which the user is currently involved, participating or enrolled, (e) deliver goods or services, including product updates or upgrades, that the user is entitled to receive under the terms of a transaction that the user has previously agreed to enter into with SuperMedia; (f) communicate other non-commercial email messages, and (g) communicate commercial email messages that the user consents to receiving.</p>

  <strong>What is SuperMedia’s position regarding online advertising and third party ad servers? </strong><br>
As part of the online advertising process, we may use information supplied from third party ad serving companies as well as other third party companies in several ways such as to: gain a better understanding of the type of individuals viewing or visiting different Web sites; evaluate and prioritize site selection when developing an online media plan; geographically target advertising; deliver product and pricing advertising/information applicable to the user’s state; and gauge the effectiveness of our online advertising.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Automatically </strong><br>
A cookie is a small, encrypted data string our server writes to your hard drive that contains your unique User ID for our Web site. Cookies help us to identify returning visitors to our Web site, which allows us to give you a more personalized, useful experience on our Web site.  Cookies may be placed on This Website by us or by a third-party that provides services to us. Cookies are used to: </p>
<ul>
  <li> deliver the appropriate geographic message </li>
  <li> manage frequency of ad exposure; avoid over delivery of the same message </li>
  <li> tailor an advertisement to better match your interests and preferences </li>
  <li> ensure that you see the correct products and pricing applicable to the state in which you live </li>
  <li> understand advertising effectiveness </li>
  <li> collect anonymous traffic data </li>
</ul>
<p> Users are free to delete Web site cookies. Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. To disable cookies, see "Setting Cookie Preferences" at the end of this policy. </p>
<p>However, some Web sites and ad serving companies have the ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion. If you reenter the same site on another occasion, or enter some other site tracked by the ad serving company/network, and specifically provide personal data. Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent ad serving companies from reestablishing history on a user. To do so, you must either continue to decline cookies each time you reenter the site to keep the tracking severed or disable cookies for the new browser session. Users who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have their browser advise them each time a Web site attempts to send a cookie to their system. At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel a cookie. </p>
<p>See also, “What information is stored by the Web site or in cookies?” below. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Who do I contact if I am concerned about online advertising and privacy?</strong> <br>
All concerns or questions about your privacy related to online advertising should be addressed through our Client Care Center which can be reached by clicking on “Help” or by contacting Client Care at 866-558-0400, Monday-Friday, 7am to 8pm CST</p>
<p><strong><br>
  How do I know I am on a secured site? </strong><br>
Every secure page on This Website has been secured with a digital certificate. You know you are on a secure page of This Website when you see a lock in the status bar at the bottom of your browser. In Internet Explorer, you can view your status bar by clicking on “View, Status Bar.” When you see the lock, double click it and a popup window opens and displays who issued the digital certificate securing that page and the dates it is valid. </p>
<p><strong><br>
  How does SuperMedia prevent unauthorized access to my account information? </strong><br>
Your password is set at a minimum of six characters, which provides added protection for your personal information. On secured pages, this site uses SSL encryption of at least 256-bits. When we collect any sensitive data from you, such as credit card number, those pages will be encrypted. </p>
<p><strong><br>
  What security measures are in place to restrict access to personal data?</strong> <br>
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p>
<p>There are a variety of security measures in place that limit internal access to data stored by This Website. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only and requires an employee to have a secure ID and password to access the information. In addition, logs are reviewed regularly to spot any inconsistencies. The Web site is continually updated with the latest known security patches that are periodically published by our system vendor. Any information that you give is password protected. For your protection, the system automatically locks out a user after 3 incorrect tries and after 20 minutes of idle time per secure session. If you forget your password, you will be prompted to supply your customer ID number and your password will be e-mailed to you. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about security on This Website, you can send us an email at spinfo@SuperMedia.com or contact Client Care at 866-558-0400, Monday-Friday, 7am to 8pm CST. </p>
<p><strong><br>
  What information is stored by This Website or in cookies? </strong><br>
  Registration information, billing information, product data, and contact e-mail addresses are stored in SuperMedia databases which are physically secure environments that are not accessible via the Internet. This information is only available to you through the use of a secure ID and password, and the information is transferred from our databases for your viewing.</p>
