<h2><a name="informationcollected"></a>Information Dex Media and Non-Dex Media Family Companies Collect, Store, and/or Share</h2>
<h3>What information does This Website gather, store and/or share?</h3>
<p>When you visit This Website, Dex Media may collect, store and/or share the following types of information: </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly      Provide </li>
<li>Personally and Non-Personally Identifiable Information  Dex Media Collects Automatically </li>
<li>Non-Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly      Provide </li>
</ul>
<p><u>Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide</u>. Dex Media collects and may store and share personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide to us. For example, Dex Media may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information (such as name, address, e-mail address and telephone number). Dex Media will not share credit card information or social security numbers. If you purchase a product or service, Dex Media may ask you to provide additional information such as your credit card information. If you register for the SuperGuarantee® Program, Dex Media will ask you to provide additional information about any service appointment you register and may track your searches and any registrations, claims and ratings/reviews you file on This Website. If you file a claim under the SuperGuarantee® Program or apply for the Superpages LocalServe® Program, Dex Media may ask you to provide additional information such as your Social Security number. If you request information relating to the sale or purchase of a vehicle on This Website, we may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information and information relating to the vehicle. Finally, in some cases (for example, if you register with us or sign-in on This Website or purchase a product or service) Dex Media may also ask you to provide other information such as a personal ID, password, security question and answer, and birthday.</p>
<p>If you choose to use an available referral service on This Website (e.g., to send a postcard, listing, page link, contest invitation, etc.), we will ask for certain personal information from the recipient (e.g., the recipient’s name, e-mail address, mobile telephone number) and your name and e-mail address. Dex Media uses the personally identifiable referral information you provide to facilitate this communication on a one-time basis, and may also store and use such personally identifiable information for analysis purposes (e.g., tracking the success of the referral feature). You are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide.</p>
<p><u>Personally and Nonpersonally Information Automatically Collected</u>. In addition, as you (and other users) browse This Website, our web servers, and non “Dex Media Family” companies with which Dex Media has an agreement may, automatically collect and track certain information about such visits, usually through the use of browser <a href="#Cookies">cookies</a>, JavaScript files and tagging, web address tracking codes, file impression counts, "web beacons", and the analysis of http headers (“Tracking Methods”). These Tracking Methods provide information such as the user’s IP address, the user’s domain name, the user’s browser type, the user’s user agent, how many users visit This Website, which pages the user visits and for how long, the date and time the user accesses This Website, the Internet address of the site from which the user directly linked to This Website and the links on This Website on which the user clicks. In addition, Dex Media may collect certain search parameters relating to searches conducted by the user which are not entered by the user.</p>
<p>Dex Media may collect and store information, including personally identifiable information, related to your usage of third-party sites that you access through the Websites, including emails that you send through the Websites. </p>
<p><u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide</u>. In some cases, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information that you provide, such as search parameters in connection with a search you conduct through This Website, ratings and reviews, and zip code. </p>
<p>To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand This Website’s capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future. We will update this Privacy Policy as our practices change to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area. </p>
<h3>How does Dex Media use, store and share information collected on This Website?</h3>
<p><u>Specific Purpose</u>. When users supply personally identifiable information about themselves for a specific purpose (for example, to register to use a feature on This Website, to purchase a product or service, to obtain a free listing, to register for a program or to use a feature of a program, to receive information, or to apply for a job), we may use, store, and/or share such information for such purpose.</p>
<p><u>Similar to Information Collected in Traditional Non-Electronic Manner</u>. We also may use, store and/or share personally identifiable information users provide as we would use, store and/or share the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner. For example, we may use such personally identifiable information to assess your credit rating. We may also use store and/or share this information to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a non-published number), to contact you in connection with a program you are participating in, user reviews and/or to evaluate your service needs, and to contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. When users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a feature on This Website, we may also use, store and/or share such personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of such feature. (For example, if you register to use the personalized directory service, we may use the personally identifiable information you provide to provide you with a more personalized and useful service, and if you create a review of a business on This Website, we may publish your initials, city and state in connection with such review.) When users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion that we may run on This Website, we may use, store and/or share such information to administer such contest, sweepstakes or promotion and to notify winners. </p>
<p><u>Communicate with You</u>. We may also use, store and/or share personally identifiable information you provide or that is automatically collected to communicate with you (e.g., to send you e-mails) and to otherwise serve you. For example, we may use your name and e-mail address to send you e-mails to (a) provide information regarding our company, marketing information about our products and services or the products and services of other companies, and newsletters, (b) conduct online surveys, (c) confirm your registration on This Website, a service registration, or orders placed online and (d) otherwise communicate with you. However, you may request not to receive (i.e., "opt-out" of receiving) commercial e-mail messages (the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service) from us (on a category-by-category basis), by clicking on <a href="http://account.dexmedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp" target="_blank">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page. If you have previously opted out of receiving commercial e-mail messages related to one or more categories, you may cancel your request to opt-out of (i.e., consent to receive commercial e-mail messages from us related to) such categories (on a category-by-category basis) by clicking on <a href="http://account.dexmedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp" target="_blank">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page.

Your personally identifiable information may also be used, stored and/or shared by non-“Dex Media Family” companies, with which we have agreements, to provide you information about their products and services.</p>
<p><u>Protect Dex Media’s Property or Other Rights</u>. In addition, Dex Media may use, store and/or share personally identifiable information you provide and information Dex Media automatically collects through This Website (and may combine personally identifiable information you provide with information Dex Media automatically collects through This Website and non-personally identifiable information you knowingly provide) as it deems appropriate to protect its property or other rights (for example, to enforce any policies or contractual provisions regarding use of the "ratings and reviews" feature or the "send a listing" feature). </p>
<p><u>Improve Website and Targeted Advertising</u>. We use, store and/or share information Dex Media automatically collects through This Website to improve This Website, to monitor its performance, to make This Website easier for you and other users to use, to manage features and programs made available through This Website and to provide behavioral tracking data to non-“Dex Media Family” companies, with which we have agreements, for the purpose of presenting you with, among other things, targeted advertising on third party websites. For example, Dex Media may use information Dex Media automatically collects in the ways described in the section entitled <a href="#Cookies">"What is a cookie and why does Dex Media use them?"</a>, below. </p>

Cookies help us to identify new and returning users to This Website, analyze click-stream data, and track historical activity on This Website, which allows us to give you a more personalized, useful experience on This Website.

<ul type="disc">
<li>deliver the appropriate geographic message </li>
<li>manage frequency of ad exposure; avoid over delivery of      the same message </li>

<p>A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your device or computer. However, customers are free to delete website cookies. Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your device or computer, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.</p>
<p>You can choose to change your browser settings to disable cookies if you do not want us to establish and maintain a unique User ID. Please be aware that cookies may be required to complete certain functions on This Website, such as ordering products or services, and, also in connection with personalized sections of This website, for example My Superpages.

<p>Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent ad serving companies from reestablishing history on a user. The user must either continue to decline cookies each time it reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or opt-out. When you opt-out, your unique user ID cookie is erased and you are reassigned an anonymous, non-id cookie. This new cookie tells websites that you have opted out and they will then know not to attempt to assign other cookies to you in the future. Opt-out cookies do not contain a unique user ID number therefore websites are not able to identify your computer uniquely. </p>
