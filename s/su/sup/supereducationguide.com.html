We also may collect clickstream information. 
In our email messages to you which are distributed through
this list, we may have information from third party providers for products and
services which may be advertised or promoted within messages we send to you
from this email list--the privacy policies of those third-party provider sites
govern the method by which they collect and use such information.</p>

<p>

profile of our user base and those of the Super Education Guide email list

and provide aggregate information to potential advertisers (no individual
information is provided to any third-party without your consent), to customize
the content and/or layout of our email messages or pages for each individual
visitor, to notify you about updates to our web site and services, to send you
our opt-in e-mail newsletter(s), to provide you with the products and/or
services for which you signed-up or registered, which may include sending
service disruption notices or other service- or product-related information via
email, and is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes
without your consent.   We may share collected information with another company in 
the event that we merge with or are acquired by another company.  Upon request, 
we will provide you with the information (e.g., email address, name, etc.) that
