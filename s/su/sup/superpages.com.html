    <p class="style1">    Idearc collects personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide to us.  For example, Idearc may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information (such as name, address, e-mail address and telephone number).  In addition, if you purchase a product or service, Idearc may ask you to provide additional information such as your credit card information, and if you apply for the Superpages Local Serve Program, Idearc may ask you to provide additional information such as your Social Security number.  In some cases (for example, if you register with us (or sign-in on This Website) or purchase a product or service), Idearc may also ask you to provide other information such as a personal ID, password, and security question and answer.</p><p class="style1">
If you choose to use an available referral service on This Website (e.g., to send a postcard, listing, page link, contest invitation, etc.), we will ask for certain personal information from the recipient (e.g., the recipient’s name, e-mail address, mobile telephone number) and your name and e-mail address.  Idearc uses the personally identifiable referral information you provide to facilitate this communication on a one-time basis, and may also store and use such personally identifiable information for analysis purposes (e.g., tracking the success of the referral feature). </p> 
<p class="style1">In addition, as you (and other users) browse This Website, our web servers automatically collect certain information about such visits (usually through the use of <a href="#Cookies">cookies</a>, javascript tags, clear .gif files (also known as “web beacons”), and the analysis of http headers), such as the user’s IP address, the user’s domain name, the user’s browser type, the user’s user agent, how many users visit This Website, which pages the user visits and for how long, the date and time the user accesses This Website, the Internet address of the site from which the user directly linked to This Website and the links on This Website on which the user clicks.  In addition, Idearc collects certain search parameters relating to searches conducted by the user which are not entered by the user.</p>  
<p class="style1">In some cases, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information that you provide, such as search parameters in connection with a search you conduct through This Website, ratings and reviews, and zip code.</p>
<p class="style1">To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand This Website's capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future.  We will update this Privacy Policy as our practices change to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.
 <br>
    </p>
    <p class="style2">        <strong>How does Idearc use information collected on This Website? </strong></p>
    <p class="style1">        When users supply personally identifiable information about themselves for a specific purpose (for example, to register to use a feature on This Website, to purchase a product or service, to obtain a free listing, to receive information, or to apply for a job), we may use such information for such purpose. </p><p class="style1">
  When users provide personally identifiable information to order products or services (or to obtain a free listing) through This Website, we may also use such personally identifiable information as we would use the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner.  For example, we may use such personally identifiable information to assess your credit rating, to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a non-published number), to contact you in connection with user reviews and/or to evaluate your service needs and contact you regarding additional services you may find useful.  When users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a feature on This Website, we may also use such personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of such feature.  (For example, if you register to use the personalized directory service, we may use the personally identifiable information you provide to provide you with a more personalized and useful service, and if you create a review of a business on Superpages.com, we may publish your initials, city and state in connection with such review.)  When users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion that we may run on This Website, we may use such information to administer such contest, sweepstakes or promotion and to notify winners.</p>
<p class="style1">We may also use personally identifiable information you provide to communicate with you (e.g., to send you e-mails) and to otherwise serve you.  For example, we may use your name and e-mail address to send you e-mails to (a) provide information regarding our company, marketing information about products and services, and newsletters, (b) conduct online surveys, (c) confirm orders placed online and (d) otherwise communicate with you.  However, you may request not to receive (i.e., “opt-out” of receiving) commercial e-mail messages (the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service) from us (on a category-by-category basis), by clicking on <a href="http://www.idearcmedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page.  If you have previously opted out of receiving commercial e-mail messages related to one or more categories, you may cancel your request to opt-out of (i.e., consent to receive commercial e-mail messages from us related to) such categories (on a category-by-category basis) by clicking on <a href="http://www.idearcmedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page.  Please note that we reserve the right to send certain types of e-mail messages that are not subject to opt-out (see information about <a href="#email">e-mails</a>, below) to online users, including those who have opted out of receiving commercial e-mail messages.</p>
