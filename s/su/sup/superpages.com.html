site </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Which pages people visit 
on our site </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From which domains our

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Which browsers people use

</ul>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">None of this information is 
associated with you as an individual (see information about cookies below). We 
use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and 
to make the Web site easier for you and other visitors to use. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><b> What about pages that 
ask for personal information?<br>
</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">When visitors supply 
information about themselves for a specific purpose, we use the information for 
that purpose (such as to provide the service or information the visitor has requested). 
For example, you may be asked to give us individual information to purchase a 
product or service, receive information, manage online account registration, or 
apply for a job. The information may range from your zip code, to your phone number, 
account number, a credit card number, age, gender, mother's maiden name, social 
security number, e-mail address, organization URL, resume, or mailing address.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">When visitors use our Web 
site to order services, we may use this personally identifiable information as 
we would use the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner. 
For example, to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories 
(unless you have requested a non-published number), or to evaluate your service 
needs and contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. If you 
do not want us to contact you, you can remove your name from our telephone or 
mail solicitation lists by clicking on <a href="http://www.superpages.com/about/contact.html">Contact 
Us</a>. Please note that this removes your name from SuperPages, however, to be 
removed from other websites in the Verizon family of companies ("Verizon 
Family"), contact them directly. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><b>What happens to information 
when I fill out registration forms?</b> <br>
The registration forms request accurate contact information (like name and e-mail 
address) and preferences that help us better serve you. Your name and e-mail address 
are used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, 
and newsletters. You may change your email, user ID or password online; or you 
can choose to remove your name from our user list by going to Contact Us and emailing 
us a request to remove your name. <br>
<br>
To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand the site's capabilities 
for obtaining information about users in the future. We will update this privacy 
statement as policies change to ensure that you are aware of developments in this 
area. <br>
<br>
<b>Do you sell or give my information to companies outside of the "Verizon Family?"</b> 
<br>
We do not sell or disclose personally identifiable information obtained online 
about our visitors, to anyone outside of the "Verizon Family" unless you specifically 
authorize it, to complete a transaction that you initiated, it is required by 
law, or disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees 
or property. If you provide personally identifiable information to us in the context 
of an event Verizon sponsors with another company, such as a contest, or if you 
register on a co-sponsored site or feature, you may also be providing the personally 
identifiable information to the co-sponsor. This will be made clear to you before 
you submit the information and you can decide whether or not to participate. <br>
<br>
Verizon may share non-personally identifiable information with non-"Verizon Family" 
companies in order to assess the results of a promotion or event or to enhance 
your online experience. For example, we may provide statistical information that 
is not identified with you: </font></p>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">The number of people who 
visit the website, which pages were visited and for how long, and the referral 
URL. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">When we host co-branded versions 
of the superpages.com site (or portions of the superpages.com site). Our co-branded 
sites may also contain clear GIFs (electronic images that allow this site to collect 
anonymous information about your visit to the site). </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Non-personally identifiable 
information may also be disclosed to non-Verizon-Family companies if it is required 
by law, or disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees 
or property. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><b>This information does not 
contain any information that would personally identify you. </b><br>
<br>
In addition, Verizon may support features and content that appear on other companies' 
web sites that you may visit. These companies may collect information about you, 
but Verizon does not have control over the collection practices of these companies. 
If you are visiting a web site which indicates that it is "powered by superpages.com," 
please read the privacy policy of that web site for its policies regarding information 
collection and usage. <br>
<b><br>
Does this site send e-mail to site visitors?</b> <br>
At times, online surveys are conducted in which you can choose to participate. 
In addition, we may use e-mail to communicate with our customers, to respond to 
visitors' e-mail, to confirm orders placed online, and to send information that 
a visitor has requested. Occasionally, we may use opt-in e-mail lists from third 
parties to promote our latest specials. If you receive an unwanted e-mail from 
us, you can click Contact Us and simply ask us to remove you from our list. <br>
<b><br>
Do you accommodate links to other sites?</b> <br>
This website contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the 
content or the privacy practices employed by other sites. We are committed to 
safeguarding customer privacy on our website. Verizon may, however, host (or contract 
with third parties to host) web site advertising linked to the superpages.com 
site (the "Verizon-Hosted Web Site Ad(s)"). If you provide personally identifiable 
information while visiting any Verizon-Hosted Web Site Ad, you will also be providing 
the personally-identifiable information to the advertiser. In addition, Verizon 
may share non-personally identifiable information collected from any Verizon-Hosted 
Web Site Ad with non-"Verizon Family" companies in order to complete a transaction 
that you initiated or to assess and report the results of the ad. Verizon is not 
responsible for the privacy practices employed by the advertiser. <br>
<b><br>
What is Verizon's position regarding online advertising and third party ad servers? 
</b><br>
Verizon accepts advertisements from third parties that serve advertising into 
the SuperPages site. Verizon may use "clear gifs" provided by such third parties 
in the pages containing the ad(s) that Verizon sends to your browser. These "clear 
gifs" provide usage pattern information about the ads to third parties. The data 
does not contain personally identifiable information. <br>
<br>
As part of the online advertising process, we may use information supplied from 
third party ad serving companies as well as other third party companies in several 
ways such as to:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">gain a better understanding 
of the type of individuals viewing or visiting different web sites</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">evaluate and prioritize site 
selection when developing online media plan</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">geographically target advertising 
</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">deliver product and pricing 
advertising/information applicable to the customers' state </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">gauge the effectiveness of 
our online advertising </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><b>Non Personally Identifiable

<br>
Cookies help Verizon to enhance the user's online experience and are used to:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"> deliver the appropriate 
geographic message </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">manage frequency of ad exposure;

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">However, customers are free 
to delete website cookies. Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies 
from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before 
a cookie is stored. To disable cookies, see "Setting Cookie Preferences" at the 
end of this policy. <br>
<br>
However, you need to understand that some websites/adserving companies have the 
ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion, if you reenter 
the same site on another occasion, or some other site tracked by the adserving 
company/network, and specifically provide personal data. <br>
<br>
Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent adserving companies from reestablishing 
history on a visitor. The visitor must either continue to decline cookies each 
time it reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or opt-out. 
When you opt-out, your unique user ID cookie is erased and you are reassigned 
an anonymous, non-id cookie. This new cookie tells websites that you have opted 
out and they will then know not to attempt to assign other cookies to you in the 
future. Opt-out cookies do not contain a unique user ID number therefore websites 
are not able to identify your computer uniquely. <br>
<br>
Customers who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have their 
browser advise them each time a web site attempts to send a cookie to your system. 
At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel a cookie.<br>
<br>
Customers who choose to "opt out" after deleting cookies will receive an anonymous/non 
personally identifiable cookie. <br>
<br>
<b>Who do I contact if I am concerned about online advertising and privacy?<br>
</b> All concerns or questions about your privacy related to online advertising 
should be addressed through our Customer Care Center which can be reached by clicking 
on <a href="http://www.superpages.com/about/contact.html">Contact Us</a>. <br>
<br>
<b>Does Verizon use the information provided online to profile its customers?</b> 
<br>
The combination of offline and online information provided by the customer has 
the ability to enhance the customer experience, and make the consumer's interaction 
with Verizon more meaningful and relevant. Verizon requires notification of any 
consumer profiling or purchasing behavior being captured by Verizon online and 
combined with offline information be clearly stated to the consumer at the time 
of online data collection. The consumer will have the ability to choose not to 
have that information aggregated and be part of subsequent marketing campaigns 
by so indicating at the point of the application, or by choosing to Opt-Out of 
future marketing campaigns from Verizon by clicking on <a href="http://www.superpages.com/about/contact.html">Contact 
Us</a>. <br>
