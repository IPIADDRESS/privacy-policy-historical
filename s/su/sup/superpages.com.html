    None of this information is associated with you as an individual (see information about cookies below). We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and to make the Web site easier for you and other visitors to use. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What about pages that ask for personal information? </strong><br>
    When visitors supply information about themselves for a specific purpose, we use the information for that purpose (such as to provide the service or information the visitor has requested). For example, you may be asked to give us individual information to purchase a product or service, receive information, manage online account registration, or apply for a job. The information may range from your zip code, to your phone number, account number, a credit card number, age, gender, mother's maiden name, social security number, e-mail address, organization URL, resume, or mailing address. <br>
    <br>
    When visitors use our Web site to order services, we may use this personally identifiable information as we would use the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner. For example, to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a non-published number), or to evaluate your service needs and contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. If you do not want us to contact you, you can remove your name from our telephone or mail solicitation lists by clicking on <a href="http://www.superpages.com/about/contact.html">Contact Us </a>. Please note that this removes your name from SuperPages, BigBook, and BigYellow, however, to be removed from other websites in the Idearc family of companies ("Idearc Family"), contact them directly. <br>
    <br>
    Idearc does not knowingly collect information from children through this web site. This web site, and any web site to which users may link from this web site, may contain content provided by advertisers or other third parties that may not be suitable for children. Idearc asks parents or legal guardians to assist Idearc by supervising the activities of children at this web site. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What happens to information when I fill out registration forms? </strong><br>
    The registration forms request accurate contact information (like name and e-mail address) and preferences that help us better serve you. Your name and e-mail address are used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters. You may change your email, user ID or password online; or you can choose to remove your name from our user list by going to Contact Us and emailing us a request to remove your name. <br>
    <br>
    To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand the site's capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future. We will update this privacy statement as policies change to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Do you sell or give my information to companies outside of the "Idearc Family?" </strong><br>
    We do not sell or disclose personally identifiable information obtained online about our visitors, to anyone outside of the "Idearc Family" unless you specifically authorize it, to complete a transaction that you initiated, it is required by law, or disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property. If you provide personally identifiable information to us in the context of an event Idearc sponsors with another company, such as a contest, or if you register on a co-sponsored site or feature, you may also be providing the personally identifiable information to the co-sponsor. This will be made clear to you before you submit the information and you can decide whether or not to participate. <br>
    <br>
    Idearc may share non-personally identifiable information with non-"Idearc Family" companies in order to assess the results of a promotion, event or third party relationship, to provide information to current or prospective customers, to complete a search or to otherwise enhance your online experience. For example, we may provide statistical information that is not identified with you: </p>

    <strong>Do you accommodate links to other sites? </strong><br>
    This website contains links to other web sites. These other web sites may, among other things, allow you to bid on and/or purchase products that you initially viewed on this web site. These other web sites may (or may not) be co-branded with Idearc or SuperPages.com, BigBook or BigYellow branding. <strong>You can tell if you have linked from one web site to another web site by looking at the URL in the browser window. If the second level domain of the URL for the page containing the link is different than the second level domain of the URL for the page to which you have linked, you have linked to a different web site. For example, if you link from a page located at the URL www.thirdleveldomain.superpages.com to a page located at the URL www.superpages.secondleveldomain.com , you have linked to another site. Please note that any of Idearc's trademarks or service marks (e.g., SuperPages, BigBook, BigYellow, etc.) may be included in the URL of a co-branded or private label web site that is owned and operated by a third party, in a location other than that occupied by the second level domain (e.g., as the third level domain). </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The companies that own or operate these web sites may track and/or collect information about you, but Idearc does not have control over the privacy practices (including, without limitation, those relating to tracking user activity, collection of user data, use of user data, and security) of these companies (although, when a user activates a link from this web site one of these other web sites, Idearc may pass the user's referral URL and IP address to the server hosting such other site). We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices (including, without limitation, those related to tracking, collection, use and security) employed by (or in connection with) other sites, and we are not responsible for the content on, or operation of, other sites (including, without limitation, any transactions conducted through such other sites). We are committed to safeguarding customer privacy on our website. <strong>If you are visiting a web site via a link on this web site, you are advised to read the privacy policy of that other web site for its policies regarding information tracking, collection, usage and security. </strong><br>
    <br>
    Idearc may, however, host (or contract with third parties to host) web site advertising linked to the superpages.com, bigbook.com and/or bigyellow.com sites (the "Idearc-Hosted Web Site Ad(s)"). If you provide personally identifiable information while visiting any Idearc-Hosted Web Site Ad, you will also be providing the personally-identifiable information to the advertiser. In addition, Idearc may share non-personally identifiable information collected from any Idearc-Hosted Web Site Ad with non-"Idearc Family" companies in order to complete a transaction that you initiated or to assess and report the results of the ad. Idearc is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by the advertiser. <br>

    <strong>What is Idearc's position regarding online advertising and third party ad servers? </strong><br>
    Idearc accepts advertisements from third parties that serve advertising into the superpages.com, bigbook.com and/or bigyellow.com sites. Idearc may use "clear gifs" provided by such third parties in the pages containing the ad(s) that Idearc sends to your browser. These "clear gifs" provide usage pattern information about the ads to third parties. The data does not contain personally identifiable information. <br>

    However, customers are free to delete website cookies. Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. To disable cookies, see "Setting Cookie Preferences" at the end of this policy. <br>
    <br>
    However, you need to understand that some websites/ad serving companies have the ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion, if you reenter the same site on another occasion, or some other site tracked by the ad serving company/network, and specifically provide personal data. <br>
    <br>
    Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent ad serving companies from reestablishing history on a visitor. The visitor must either continue to decline cookies each time it reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or opt-out. When you opt-out, your unique user ID cookie is erased and you are reassigned an anonymous, non-id cookie. This new cookie tells websites that you have opted out and they will then know not to attempt to assign other cookies to you in the future. Opt-out cookies do not contain a unique user ID number therefore websites are not able to identify your computer uniquely. <br>
    <br>
    Customers who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have their browser advise them each time a web site attempts to send a cookie to your system. At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel a cookie. <br>
    <br>
    Customers who choose to "opt out" after deleting cookies will receive an anonymous/non personally identifiable cookie. <br>

    <strong>Who do I contact if I am concerned about online advertising and privacy? </strong><br>
    All concerns or questions about your privacy related to online advertising should be addressed through our Customer Care Center which can be reached by clicking on <a href="http://www.superpages.com/about/contact.html">Contact Us </a>. <br>

    <strong>Does Idearc use the information provided online to profile its customers? </strong><br>
    The combination of offline and online information provided by the customer has the ability to enhance the customer experience, and make the consumer's interaction with Idearc more meaningful and relevant. Idearc requires notification of any consumer profiling or purchasing behavior being captured by Idearc online and combined with offline information be clearly stated to the consumer at the time of online data collection. The consumer will have the ability to choose not to have that information aggregated and be part of subsequent marketing campaigns by so indicating at the point of the application, or by choosing to Opt-Out of future marketing campaigns from Idearc by clicking on <a href="http://www.superpages.com/about/contact.html">Contact Us </a>. <br>

    <strong>How do I know I am on a secured site? </strong><br>

    <br>
    <strong>What security measures are in place to restrict access to personal data? </strong><br>
    There are a variety of security measures in place that limits internal access to data stored by the Idearc site. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only and requires an employee to have a secure ID and password to access the information. In addition, logs are reviewed regularly to spot any inconsistencies. The site is continually updated with the latest known security patches that are periodically published by the system vendor. Any information that you give is password protected. For your protection, the system automatically locks out a user after 3 incorrect tries and after 20 minutes of idle time per secure session. If you forget your password, you will be prompted to supply your customer ID number and your password will be e-mailed to you. <br>
    <br>
