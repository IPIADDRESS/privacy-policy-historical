	<br>
<div id="inside">
	<p>
		Support.com respects your privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of your Personal Information that you may submit to us by telephone, our support web site located at www.Support.com ("Site") or during the performance of the remote computer support services provided via telephone or online via the Site ("Services") by Support.com, Inc., its subsidiaries and contractors ("Support.com," "We" or "Us"). "Personal Information" is information that (i) is recorded in any form; (ii) is about you, or pertains to you; and (iii) can be linked to you. Personal Information includes information like your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and non-public information that is associated with the foregoing. Personal Information does not include information that pertains to you, but cannot reasonably be used to identify you.</p>
	<p>
		We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. Support.com has created this policy to inform you how your Personal Information will be treated if you use the Site or our Services. In general, you can visit the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personally identifiable information from you.</p>
	<p>
		Support.com voluntarily adheres to the <font size="2">"Safe Harbor" framework </font>concerning the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States. Accordingly, we follow the Safe Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce ("Principles") with respect to all such data. The Principles can be found at <font size="2"><a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor</a></font>. If there is any conflict between this Privacy Policy ("Policy") and the Principles, the Principles will govern.</p>
	<h2>
		Consent</h2>
	<p>

	<p>
		FOR THOSE OF YOU VISITING US FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, CANADA, OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU ENTER WILL BE TRANSFERRED OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION OR YOUR HOME COUNTRY FOR USE BY SUPPORT.COM AND ITS AFFILIATES FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED IN THIS POLICY. YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED AND STORED IN THE UNITED STATES, AND AS A RESULT, GOVERNMENTS, COURTS, OR LAW ENFORCEMENT OR REGULATORY AGENCIES MAY BE ABLE TO OBTAIN DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION THROUGH LAWS APPLICABLE IN THE UNITED STATES. BY USING OUR SITE AND PROVIDING US WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOU CONSENT TO THIS TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.</p>
	<h2>
		Collection of Personal Information</h2>
	<p>
		The Personal Information we gather from you helps us learn more about the visitors of our Site and users of our Services. We may collect information that you voluntarily submit to us, including the following Personal Information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			To create an account for our Services, you must provide Support.com with a valid e-mail address and a password of your choice. You may also provide us with your telephone number.</li>
		<li>
			If you decide to order any of the services we offer, we will collect the information necessary to charge your credit card, including your full name, your billing address, and the credit card information.</li>
		<li>
			When you contact us by sending us an e-mail, we will collect any information that is contained in your e-mail.</li>
		<li>
			We may give you&nbsp;the opportunity to sign up for an electronic newsletter after you have provided us with your e-mail address.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Services you are able to use.</p>
	<h2>
		Use of Cookies</h2>
	<p>
		We use cookies to personalize your visit to the Site and your use of the Services. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent storage of the information. Please note that if you set your browser to not accept cookies, you may not be able to fully view or use all parts of the Site and your use of the Services might be limited.</p>
	<h2>
		Site Navigation</h2>
	<p>
		We use tools to analyze traffic patterns and inform us how visitors are using the Site and how successfully we are marketing our Services. We log your Internet (IP) address to give us an idea of which parts of our Site you visit and how long you spend there. We also collect the Internet address from which you arrived on our Site (if any) and the Internet browser you are using to visit our Site.

		System Data Collection, Remote Control and Utilities</h2>
	<p>
		Our Services help diagnose and resolve technology problems that you may have.

By ordering our Services, you are giving express permission to Support.com to download and use the software described above (the "Support.com Software"). Depending on the Services that you order, the Support.com Software may allow us to temporarily take control of your computer and modify your computer settings to resolve your personal technology problem. For other Services, the Support.com Software will report non-personal information about your computer's performance and configuration to you and to Support.com. For such Services, the Support.com Software will run on a regular basis, but only after you elect to run the Support.com Software and report your computer information to yourself and to Support.com. In every instance, Support.com will solely use the Support.com Software and the information that it provides to attempt to identify and resolve your existing and potential personal technology problem(s) and use reasonable efforts to limit its access of your Personal Information while performing the Services and only after you have given us permission to do so. However, in the course of providing the Services to you, Support.com may inadvertently see, access, or be exposed to Personal Information on your computer.

Support.com may use the data collected during such recordings for purposes of improving customer service, internal training, and internal market research and will handle such data as described in the previous paragraph with respect to Personal Information that may be contained in such data. Solely with respect to Services recordings that do not contain Personal Information, Support.com may use such recordings or extracts from such recordings to promote and market the Services, provided that Support.com will not use or disclose any audio recording elements in any external marketing or promotion without your specific prior consent to do so. Support.com will delete recordings after a reasonable amount of time.</p>
	<h2>
		Use of Personal Information</h2>
	<p>

	<p>
		Support.com may also collect and create aggregate information about customers, sales, traffic patterns, and data about our services and systems, and use such information internally to improve the Services, for training, for marketing and promotional purposes, and for other business purposes, and we may provide it to third parties at our discretion, but this aggregate information will not include any Personal Information.</p>
	<h2>
		Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			we have your permission to make the disclosure;</li>
		<li>
			the disclosure is required by law, regulation or mandatory professional standards;</li>
		<li>
			the disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or other disposition of all or part of our business;</li>
		<li>
			the information in question is publicly available;</li>
		<li>
			the disclosure is reasonably necessary to establish legal claims;</li>
		<li>

		<li>

We may share the Personal Information that we collect from you with these third party contractors to the extent necessary for them to perform their services to Support.com, and they may collect information (including Personal Information) from you in connection with providing the Services to the same extent as Support.com may collect information from you under this Privacy Policy. These contractors are only permitted to use such information (including Personal Information) for the purposes of providing services to Support.com and are obligated by the contracts that they have signed with us to use reasonable security measures to protect your Personal Information and to keep your Personal Information confidential.</p>

As part of such Business Relationships, our Services may be provided in connection with the services of one or more of our business partners. To the extent Support.com collects and stores information (including Personal Information) in connection with such Business Relationships, such collection and storing will be done in accordance with this Privacy Policy, unless we, or our business partner(s), inform you otherwise and obtain your consent. It is also possible that we may receive information (including Personal Information) about you in the course of such Business Relationships that was collected by our business partner(s) to enable us to provide our Services to you, in which case we will handle such information as described in this Privacy Policy, but we will have no influence on how the information is handled by our business partners. We may share some of the information we collect in connection with such Business Relationships with our business partners, and these business partners will use and handle such information in accordance with their privacy policy and not the Support.com Privacy Policy. Such sharing will only be done in connection with the respective Business Relationship. Support.com will share only that information necessary for delivery of the Services, unless you have consented to the sharing of your information with the business partner or the jurisdiction in which you receive the Services does not require your consent prior to such transfer.</p>

	<p>
		In the event Support.com goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Support.com or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. You hereby consent to Support.com sharing your Personal Information under the above circumstances.</p>
	<p>

	<p>
		Support.com expressly reserves the right, and in some states may be legally required, to report certain materials, such as, but not limited to, child pornography or terror plans, that we may become aware of in the course of providing the Services to the authorities in charge.</p>
	<h2>
		Feedback</h2>
	<p>
		If you provide feedback to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any purpose, provided we do not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. We will collect any information contained in such feedback and will treat the Personal Information in it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<h2>
		Choices Regarding Personal Information</h2>
	<p>

You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature, but if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to deactivate your account with us, which involves termination of the Terms of Service.</p>
	<p>

	<h2>
		Security of Personal Information</h2>
	<p>
		To help protect the privacy of information you transmit through use of the Site and/or Services, Support.com uses industry-standard technology that encrypts information you exchange with us through our Site. In addition, Support.com uses reasonable standard industry practice to protect the information we collect from you against unauthorized access. However, no company, including Support.com, can fully eliminate security risks associated with the handling of information, including Personal Information, over the Internet, and with the storing of such information on servers that are connected with the Internet. If Support.com learns of a security breach that involves your Personal Information and could result in identify theft, we will attempt to notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Services, or providing Personal Information to us through any means, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Services. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach by mail. To add your name and mailing address to our list for notification purposes only, or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@Support.com"><strong><u><font color="#00535e">privacy@Support.com</font></u></strong></a>.</p>
	<h2>
		Links to Other Sites</h2>
	<p>
		The Services may contain links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by Support.com. The provision of such links is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such websites or location or its contents. We have no control over, do not review and are not responsible for the privacy policies of or content displayed on such other websites. Please be aware that the terms of our Privacy Policy do not apply to any outside websites</p>
	<h2>
		Our Commitment To Children's Privacy</h2>
	<p>
		Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we do not intentionally collect or maintain information from those we actually know are under the age of 13, and no part of our website is intended to be structured to attract anyone under this age.</p>
	<h2>
		Policy Subject to Change</h2>
	<p>
		This version of the Privacy Policy was last updated in August 2010. If we decide to change our privacy practices, we will post those changes on this page and post a notice on the home page of the Site so that you are informed of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we may disclose it. If at any point we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify registered users by way of an e-mail. You will have a choice to opt out of any new or different uses of your Personal Information. We will use your information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>
