    <h1>support.com Service Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>SupportSoft respects your privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of your personal information that you may submit to us by telephone, our support web site located at www.support.com (“Site”) or during the performance of the remote computer support services provided via telephone or online via the Site (“Services”) by SupportSoft, Inc., its subsidiaries and contractors (“SupportSoft,” “we” or “us”).  We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner.  SupportSoft has created this policy to inform you how your personal information will be treated if you use the Site or order our Services.  In general, you can visit the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself.  It is our intent to let you know before we collect personally identifiable information from you.</p>

    <h2>Consent</h2>
    <p>By using our Site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Policy.  Because SupportSoft operates globally, we make information we gather available to our worldwide business units. For those of you visiting us from Canada or the European Union, please note that the personal information you enter will be transferred outside the European Union for use by SupportSoft and its affiliates for any of the purposes described in this Policy. By using our Site and providing us with your personal information, you consent to this transfer of your personal information.</p>

    <h2>Collection and Use of your Personal Information</h2>
    <p>There are times when we request that you voluntarily provide information such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number and address to register for certain benefits on the Site or order certain Services. We use this information to provide you Services and to personalize and improve our customer service and marketing efforts.  By registering on our Site or ordering Services, you are consenting to receive information from us about our Site and Services.  You will always have the option to “opt out” of receiving additional information from us.</p>
    <p>If you order Services, we will ask for credit card and billing information necessary to process your transaction.  We may disclose this information to our third party contractors who perform services for SupportSoft in order to process your payment and complete your transaction.</p>

    <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
    <p>We use “cookies” to personalize your Web browsing experience. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent storage of the information.  Please note that if you set your browser to not accept “cookies,” you may not be able to fully view or use all parts of the Site.</p>

    <h2>Site Navigation</h2>
    <p>We use tools to analyze traffic patterns and inform us how our users are using the Site and how successfully we are marketing.  We do log your Internet address to give us an idea of which parts of our Site you visit and how long you spend there. We may rely on third parties to provide this technology to us.</p>

    <h2>System Data Collection, Remote Control and Utilities</h2>
    <p>Our Services help diagnose and resolve computer problems.  SupportSoft uses several types of software: the first type provides computer system information to SupportSoft which helps us diagnose and resolve your personal technology problem, the second type allows SupportSoft to remotely control your computer and modify its settings or software, and the third type generally consists of utilities and other tools to improve computer performance and help solve your personal technology problem as described in our Terms of Service.  By ordering Services, you are giving permission to SupportSoft to download and use software to take control of your computer and modify your computer settings to resolve your personal technology problem.  SupportSoft will only use such software to attempt to resolve your personal technology problem and use reasonable efforts to limit its access of your personal information while performing the services.  However, SupportSoft may inadvertently access personal information on your computer. If SupportSoft becomes aware of such inadvertent access, we will use reasonable efforts to promptly delete such personal information from our servers, if applicable, and in any event will treat such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You are responsible for and SupportSoft has no liability for securing and backing up your computer network, information and software as further set forth in the Terms of Service.</p>

    <h2>Monitoring of the Services</h2>
    <p>We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and record the Services, including telephone calls and online sessions for purposes of improving customer service, internal training and internal market research.  You acknowledge and agree that we may monitor and record the Services and to disclose any information as necessary or appropriate to satisfy any law, regulation or other governmental request, to operate the Services properly, or to protect ourselves and/or our Users.</p>

    <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.  We may disclose your personal information to our third party contractors who perform services for SupportSoft in order to i) confirm your transactions, ii) complete the Services, and provide you additional information about our Site and Services.  These contractors are permitted to use the personal information only for the purposes of providing such services and have contractual obligations to use reasonable security measures to protect your personal information.</p>
    <p>SupportSoft may provide aggregate statistics about our users, sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to third parties, but this information will not include personally identifiable information. SupportSoft may also release information when we believe in good faith that such release is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with legal or regulatory requirements; (2) enforce or apply the Site’s terms of service; or (3) protect the rights, property or safety of SupportSoft or others. SupportSoft reserves the right and in some states may be legally required to report any knowledge of restricted materials such as child pornography to the applicable authorities.</p>
    <p>In connection with the sale, assignment or other transfer of SupportSoft, or its business or assets to which the Site or Services relate, we may transfer your personal information to another entity if such entity agrees to treat your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
    <p>We do our best to maintain the accuracy of personal information you supply to us. You may access and update your personal information by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@support.com">privacy@support.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Security of Information</h2>
    <p>To help protect the privacy of information you transmit through use of this Site, SupportSoft uses industry-standard software that encrypts the information you input before it is sent to us.  In addition, SupportSoft uses standard industry practice to protect all of the visitor information we collect against unauthorized access.  However, you should keep in mind that this Site and our Services are run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond our control.  If SupportSoft learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.  By using the Services, or providing personal information to us through any means, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Services.  Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.  To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@support.com">privacy@support.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>

    <h2>Policy Subject to Change</h2>
    <p>This version of the Privacy Policy is effective as of March 15, 2007.  If we decide to change our privacy practices, we will post those changes on this page and post a notice on our home page so that you are always kept informed of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. If at any point we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify registered users by way of an e-mail. Registered users will have a choice to opt out of any new or different uses of their information.  We will use your information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>

    <h2>BBB OnLine Privacy Program</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. By participating in the Council of Better Business Bureau’s BBBOnLine Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet the program’s strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have it verified by BBBOnLine. Further information about this program is available at www.bbbonline.org.</p>
