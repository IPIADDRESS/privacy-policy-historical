We have a firm and continuing commitment to the privacy of personal information provided by those visiting and interacting with any website controlled by SuperFastBusiness and have created this policy to apply across our various websites and apps. </p> <p>We hold the privacy of your personal information in the highest regard and this privacy notice provides you with details of how we collect and process your personal data through your use of our sites to enable you to make informed decisions about your personal information. </p> <p>By providing us with your data, you warrant to us that you are over 13 years of age</p> <p>When we talk about ‘us’ ‘we’ or ‘our’, we mean SuperFastBusiness ABN 52 219 259 671, PO Box 876, Spit Junction, NSW 2088, Australia and we are the operator of the website from which you accessed this privacy policy and any other websites or apps controlled by SuperFastBusiness (collectively ‘website’). We are the data controller and we are responsible for your personal data.</p> <p>When we talk about ‘you’, we mean you as a participant or user of this website or services of this website.</p> <p>‘Personal information’ is information that directly identifies you, such as your name and email address, or data that could be used, on its own or in combination with other data, to identify you.</p> <p>It is very important that the information we hold about you is accurate and up to date. Please let us know if at any time your personal information changes by issuing a ticket at support @ superfastbusiness.com.</p> <p><strong>1. Staying Anonymous</strong></p> <p>You can browse our online services anonymously. However, if you request information, sign up for our communications or podcast or purchase any of our products or services, you will need to identify yourself and at that point we will collect your personal information. If you do not give personal information to us, it will affect our ability to provide you with requested information or to deliver our products or services.</p> <p><strong>2. Collecting personal information</strong></p> <p>At all times we aim to only collect the minimum information we need for the services we are providing and to only use the information for the purpose it has been provided. For example, if you sign up to our newsletter, we will collect and use your email address to send our newsletter. As you would expect, the more involved you are with us, the more information about you we will collect. </p> <p>There are some unusual terms in new legislation that affect how we tell you about the way we manage your personal information. One is letting you know the ‘lawful ground’ for what we do. This just means we are letting you know that there is a provision in the legislation that says it is alright for us to collect or use your information for a purpose that is considered a ‘legitimate interest’ of our business. </p> <p>The main way we collect information about you is when you give it to us and this can happen in a variety of ways. We may process the following categories of personal information about you:</p> <ul> <li>Communication data: which includes any communication that you send to us. This might be when you join our mailing list or when you contact us through the contact form on our website, through email, text, social media messaging, social media posting or any other communication that you send us. Communication data may also include geographical data if you enable this within our app so that we can send you communications relevant to your geographical location. We process this data for the purposes of communicating with you, for record keeping and for the establishment, pursuance or defence of legal claims. Our lawful ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in replying to communications sent to us, keeping appropriate records and to establish, pursue or defend legal claims.</li> <li>Customer Data: which includes data you give to us when you purchase goods and/or services from us including any of our business training programs or events. This will include basic information about you and the information we require for billing purposes such as your name, title, billing address, delivery address email address, phone number, contact details, purchase details and your card details (last digits only). We use third party services for processing payments such as PayPal, EWay and Stripe and we do not receive or store your full card payment information. We process this data to supply the goods and/or services you have expressed an interest in or purchased and to keep records of such transactions. Our lawful ground for this processing is the performance of a contract between you and us and/or taking steps at your request to enter into that contract and our legitimate business interest of keeping records for accounting purposes.</li> <li>User Data: which includes data about how you use our website and any online services together with any data that you post for publication on our website or through other online services. We process this data to operate our website and ensure relevant content is provided to you, to ensure the security of our website, to maintain back-ups of our website and/or databases and to enable publication and administration of our website, other online services and business.
