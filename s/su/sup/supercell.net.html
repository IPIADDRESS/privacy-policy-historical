If you provide your email address in connection with a Supercell game, the email address will be retained by Supercell and we may use that email address to contact you about your gaming experience with Supercell games and notify you about company news and promotions.  Your phone number may be used to help connect you with other users via our social networking system and for SMS notifications. Your birth date may be used to analyze user trends and target certain promotions.</p>
<p>Supercell’s Sites</p>
<p>While you are browsing Supercell’s Sites, your computer’s operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language and referring Web site addresses may be logged automatically.  We may use this information to monitor and analyze your use of the Service.  In addition,  we may ask you to submit and we may process data that is personal to you, including but not limited to your name, profile photo, gender, age or birthday, links to your profiles on SN Websites and other third party sites, user names, phone number, and e-mail and mail addresses.  We may use this information to create a user profile.  We may use your email address to contact you about your experience with Supercell Sites and notify you about company news and promotions.

Your mail address may be used if we have merchandise or other physical promotional materials that we want to send to you.  </p>
<p>When you interact with Supercell’s Sites, Supercell will create an online user ID number to identify your profile on the Supercell Site.  This online user ID number will appear in the URL of Supercell’s Sites, but will only permit access to information that is considered public or that you have designated as public.  You may opt-out at any time of public indexing of your public profile information. </p>
<p>Forums</p>
<p>Supercell may at times offer you the ability to post content to a blog, message board, chat room or within Supercell’s applications or other forums (“Forums”). You should be aware that any visitor to the Forums may read your postings on the Forums.  Furthermore, any information that you may post to a Forum, including your username or other account profile information, will be disclosed and available to all users and viewers of that Forum, and will therefore no longer be private.  Supercell cannot guarantee the security of such information that is disclosed or communicated online in public areas such as the Forums, and you provide such information at your own risk.  Supercell does not author, edit, endorse, or monitor any Forum.  You acknowledge and agree that Supercell has no responsibility for the accuracy or availability of information provided on any Forum.  Supercell reserves the right at any time, in its sole discretion, to remove any content that a user may post on any Forum and restrict their access to any Forum.</p>
<p>Invite a Friend</p>
<p>Supercell may offer you the opportunity to opt-in to import your address book contacts or manually enter e-mail addresses so that your contacts can be located in Supercell games and/or you can invite them to join you in Supercell games.  Such contact information will be used only for the purpose of sending communications to the addressee.  We send these invites on your behalf and as your service provider.  You agree that you and/or your friend are responsible for any text messaging rates that apply.  You can opt-out from the storing of these contacts.  Passwords provided to Supercell for importing purposes will not be stored by Supercell.  In addition, you or the third party may contact us at support@supercell.net to request the removal of this information from our database.</p>
<p>iOS and Android Platforms</p>
<p> When you use any of the Supercell games or applications on a mobile platform, we may collect and record certain information such as your unique device ID, hardware type, the version of your operating system (“OS”), your device name, your telephone number, your email address (if you provide this information to us upon request), and your location (based on your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address and longitude and latitude).  This information is useful to us for troubleshooting and helps us understand usage trends. Your phone number may be used to help connect you with other users via our social networking system and for SMS notifications.</p>
<p>We may also give users the opportunity to opt-in to location-based services, which rely upon a device’s GPS coordinates.  You may opt-out of these location services via the settings on your device.  A user’s location may be used to suggest friends with whom they might want to connect, analyze usage trends or target certain promotions.</p>
<p>In addition, we create a unique user mobile ID to track your use of our Service.  This unique user mobile ID is stored in connection with your profile information to track the Supercell games you are playing.  In addition, it may be used to link a character with which you play our games to your username on the Forums.  We may link the unique user mobile ID to the online user ID to connect your profiles and associated data for internal analysis and targeting certain promotions.  </p>
<p>We may also collect (1) your name, (2) your email address, and (3) your age or birthday directly from you when you access our Service through your mobile device. If you provide your email address in connection with a Supercell game, the email address will be retained by Supercell and we may use that email address to contact you about your gaming experience with Supercell games and notify you about company news and promotions.  Your phone number may be used to help connect you with other users via our social networking system and for SMS notifications. Your birth date may be used to analyze user trends and target certain promotions. </p>
<p>Game Data Collection</p>
<p>Whenever you play our games, regardless of the platform on which you play, we collect data about all of your interactions with the game and with the other players inside the game via server log files.  </p>
<p>Other Collection</p>
<p>We may also acquire information from you through (1) your access and participation in message boards on the Service, (2) your email of a question to our customer support, (3) your participation in surveys regarding the Service or (4) your participation in a sweepstakes or contest through the Service.</p>
<p>If we begin offering our Service on a platform without an in-app purchase billing system, we may need to collect credit card and billing information.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that we transfer to your computer and/or device, to identify a user’s computer/device and to “remember” things about your visit, such as your preferences or a user name and password.  Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your personal information for purposes such as improving the quality of our Service, tailoring recommendations to your interests, and making the Service easier to use.  You can disable cookies at any time, although you may not be able to access or use features of the Service.</p>
<p>We may feature advertisements served by third parties that deliver cookies to your computer/device so the content you access and advertisements you see can be tracked.  Since the third party advertising companies associate your computer/device with a number, they will be able to recognize your computer/device each time they send you an advertisement.  These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Service and third party sites and applications in order to measure advertisement performance and to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.  This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for the data collection practices of these third party advertisers, and we encourage you to check their privacy policies to learn more about their use of cookies and other technology.</p>

Advertisers use web beacons in connection with our Services in order to collect and use data regarding the viewing and usage of content, advertisement performance and your interests for the purpose of delivering relevant advertising to you.</p>
