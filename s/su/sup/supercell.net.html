<p>
	<span style="font-size:14px;"><strong>Supercell’s Sites</strong></span></p>
<p>
	While you are browsing Supercell’s Sites, your computer’s operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language and referring Web site addresses may be logged automatically. We may use this information to monitor and analyze your use of the Service. In addition, we may ask you to submit and we may process data that is personal to you, including but not limited to your name, profile photo, gender, age or birthday, links to your profiles on SN Websites and other third party sites, user names, phone number, and e-mail and mail addresses.

This online user ID number will appear in the URL of Supercell’s Sites, but will only permit access to information that is considered public or that you have designated as public. You may opt-out at any time of public indexing of your public profile information.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:14px;"><strong>Forums</strong></span></p>
<p>
	Supercell may at times offer you the ability to post content to a blog, message board, chat room or within Supercell’s applications or other forums (“Forums”). You should be aware that any visitor to the Forums may read your postings on the Forums. Furthermore, any information that you may post to a Forum, including your username or other account profile information, will be disclosed and available to all users and viewers of that Forum, and will therefore no longer be private. Supercell cannot guarantee the security of such information that is disclosed or communicated online in public areas such as the Forums, and you provide such information at your own risk. Supercell does not author, edit, endorse, or monitor any Forum. You acknowledge and agree that Supercell has no responsibility for the accuracy or availability of information provided on any Forum.

Such contact information will be used only for the purpose of sending communications to the addressee. We send these invites on your behalf and as your service provider.

	When you use any of the Supercell games or applications on a mobile platform, we may collect and record certain information such as your unique device ID, hardware type, the version of your operating system (“OS”), your device name, your telephone number, your email address (if you provide this information to us upon request), and your location (based on your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address and longitude and latitude). This information is useful to us for troubleshooting and helps us understand usage trends. Your phone number may be used to help connect you with other users via our social networking system and for SMS notifications.</p>
<p>
	We may also give users the opportunity to opt-in to location-based services, which rely upon a device’s GPS coordinates. You may opt-out of these location services via the settings on your device. A user’s location may be used to suggest friends with whom they might want to connect, analyze usage trends or target certain promotions.</p>
<p>
	In addition, we create a unique user mobile ID to track your use of our Service. This unique user mobile ID is stored in connection with your profile information to track the Supercell games you are playing. In addition, it may be used to link a character with which you play our games to your username on the Forums. We may link the unique user mobile ID to the online user ID to connect your profiles and associated data for internal analysis and targeting certain promotions.</p>
<p>
	We may also collect (1) your name, (2) your email address, and (3) your age or birthday directly from you when you access our Service through your mobile device.

Your phone number may be used to help connect you with other users via our social networking system and for SMS notifications. Your birth date may be used to analyze user trends and target certain promotions.</p>

	<span style="font-size:14px;"><strong>Cookies</strong></span></p>

These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Service and third party sites and applications in order to measure advertisement performance and to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
