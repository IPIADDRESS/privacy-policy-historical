"Personal Information" is information that (i) is recorded in any form; (ii) is about you, or pertains to you; and (iii) can be linked to you. Personal Information includes information like your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and non-public information that is associated with the foregoing. Personal Information does not include information that pertains to you, but cannot reasonably be used to identify you.
<br>
<br>
We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. Support.com has created this policy to inform you how your Personal Information will be treated if you use our web sites, software or services. In general, you can visit our web sites without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personally identifiable information from you.
<br>
<br>
Support.com voluntarily adheres to the "Safe Harbor" framework concerning the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States.

<b>Information We Collect and How We Use it</b>
<br>
<br>
We collect Personal Information when you subscribe to one of our newsletters, download a trial version of a product, or purchase a product or service from us or from our partners.

For example, if you sign up for a newsletter or download an evaluation version of our software, we may only collect your name and email address. However, if you make a purchase from us then we may also collect your credit card number, phone number and physical address in order to complete the purchase, verify your identity and deliver any physical products. We may combine information that we have about you with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. Support.com automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Support.com cookie information, and pages you request.

<br>
<br>
During your use of our software and services, our systems may also collect information from your computer that is not used to identify you, but is helpful in our efforts to provide the features or services you have requested.  This includes information such as the type of computer and processor you are using, which version of the operating system is installed, the configuration of your computer in terms of other application programs used, your computer’s Media Access Control address, whether any security software is installed and if it is up-to-date, and information on how you use our products.
