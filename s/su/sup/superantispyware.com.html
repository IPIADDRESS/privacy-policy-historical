<span class="ctextheaderlarge">Privacy Policy</span>
<br>
<br>
Support.com respects your privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of your Personal Information that you may submit to Us by telephone, when using our websites, online services, software or during the performance of remote computer support services provided via telephone or online by Support.com, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliated entities ("Support.com", "We", "Our" or "Us"). "Personal Information" is information that (i) is recorded in any form; (ii) is about you or pertains to you, and (iii) can be linked to you. Personal Information includes information like your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and other information that is associated with the foregoing. Personal Information does not include information We may collect that does not identify you ("Other Information"), such as how many devices use a particular operating system or how many customers experience a certain kind of technical problem.
<br>
<br>
We recognize that when you choose to provide Us with information about yourself, you trust Us to act in a responsible manner. Support.com has created this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") to inform you how your Personal Information will be treated if you use Our websites, software or services. In general, you can visit Our websites without telling Us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.
<br>
<br>
Support.com's authorized partners ("Partners") may use Our software or online services to provide their services to you ("Partner Services"). Partner Services may be governed by the respective Partner's privacy policy, which terms may differ from this Privacy Policy.
<br>
<br>
<b>Information We Collect and How We Use it</b>
<br>
<br>
We collect Personal Information in a variety of ways, including when you subscribe to one of Our newsletters, download a trial version of a product, or receive a product or service from Us or one of Our distribution partners or from a service provider who licenses one of Our remote support systems, such as Support.comÂ® Cloud. The type of information We collect may vary based on the way We interact with you. For example, if you sign up for a newsletter or download an evaluation version of Our software, We may only collect your name and email address. However, if you make a purchase from Us then We may also collect your credit card number over the phone, and we may collect your phone number and physical address in order to complete the purchase, verify your identity and deliver any physical products. We may combine information We have about you with information We obtain from business partners or other companies. If you provide Us with any Personal Information relating to other people, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
<br>
<br>
We use Personal Information and Other Information to provide you with the products or services you have requested, process any payments you have agreed to for such products and services, contact you regarding specific products or services you have requested, provide other information you have requested from Us, customize advertisements or content you may see while using Our products or services, and, if you have agreed to receive special promotional offers from Us by email or otherwise, to contact you regarding such promotional offers. Support.com may also display or provide you with targeted content or promotional offers based on Personal Information; and from time to time We may use Personal Information to offer you products or services. We may also use Personal Information for other business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, fraud monitoring and prevention, developing new products, enhancing, improving or modifying Our services, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of Our promotional campaigns and operating and expanding Our business activities.
<br>
<br>
During your use of Our website, software and services, Our systems may also collect Other Information from your device and network that is not used to identify you, but is helpful in Our efforts to provide the features or services you have requested. This includes information such as the type of computer and processor you are using, which version of the operating system is installed, the configuration of your computer in terms of other application programs used, your computer's Media Access Control address, whether any security software is installed and if it is up-to-date, the names, makes and models of other devices on your network, and information on how you use Our products. For example, Support.com automatically receives and records information on Our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Support.com cookie information, and the webpages you request. This is done as part of regular internet communication between a browser and a website. We use this information to provide the services and functions you request, and to improve Our product and service offerings in the future. We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where We are required to do otherwise under applicable law.  If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it for the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information as detailed in this Privacy Policy.

<b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b>
<br>

<li>As We believe to be necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law or legal process, which might include laws outside your country of residence, or to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including those outside your country of residence, for the purposes of meeting national security or law enforcement requirements, subpoenas, or court orders, or establishing or exercising Our legal rights or defending against legal claims.</li>

<b>Tracking Technologies</b>
<br>
<br>
Support.com and its marketing partners, affiliates, analytics providers, or customer support providers use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and local shared objects such as Flash LSO, HTML5 and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about Our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.
<br>
<br>
We use cookies for Our shopping cart, to remember users' settings, and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use Our website, but your ability to use some features or areas of Our website may be limited. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. You may manage Flash cookies at: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html</a>
<br>
<br>
As is true of most websites, We gather Other Information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the website, to track users' movements around the website and to gather demographic information about Our user base as a whole. We may combine this automatically collected log information with Personal Information We collect about you. We do this to improve the services We offer you, and to improve marketing, analytics, and website functionality. If We combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your location), We will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.
<br>
<br>
We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other websites. Our third party partners may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of this interest-based advertising, you may visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info/">http://www.aboutads.info/</a> to learn about opt-out options.

You can access, edit and request deletion of your Personal Information stored by Us at any time by utilizing web services, if available, or by contacting Us via one of the methods listed at the end of the Privacy Policy. In your request, please make clear what Personal Information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your Personal Information suppressed from Our database or otherwise let Us know what limitations you would like to put on Our use of your Personal Information.  For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular email address that you use to send Us your request, and We may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.
<br>
<br>
We may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Information provided until after the completion of such purchase).

<br>
<br>
<b>Retention Period</b>
<br>
<br>
We will retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with Our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce Our agreements.
<br>
<br>
<b>Confidentiality and Security</b>
<br>
<br>
We limit access to Personal Information about you to employees and contractors who We believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to help protect Personal Information We collect about you from unauthorized use or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on Our order forms, We encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
<br>
<br>
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, We cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on Our website, please contact Us at <a href="mailto:privacy@support.com">privacy@support.com</a>.
