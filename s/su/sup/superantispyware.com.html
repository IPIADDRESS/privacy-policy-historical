<br>
<br>
SUPERAntiSpyware respects your privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of your Personal Information that you may submit to us by telephone, when using our web sites or software or during the performance of the remote computer support services provided via telephone or online via the our web sites by SUPERAntiSpyware. In this Privacy Policy, references to "We," "Our" and "Us" refer to SUPERAntiSpyware while "You" and "Your" refer to you, the customer or user. 
<br>
<br>
"Personal Information" is information that (i) is recorded in any form; (ii) is about you, or pertains to you; and (iii) can be linked to you. Personal Information includes information like your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and non-public information that is associated with the foregoing. Personal Information does not include information that pertains to you, but cannot reasonably be used to identify you.
<br>
<br>
We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. SUPERAntiSpyware has created this policy to inform you how your Personal Information will be treated if you use our web sites, software or services. In general, you can visit our web sites without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personally identifiable information from you.
<br>
<br>
SUPERAntiSpyware voluntarily adheres to the "Safe Harbor" framework concerning the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States. Accordingly, we follow the Safe Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce ("Principles") with respect to all such data. The Principles can be found at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>. If there is any conflict between this Privacy Policy ("Policy") and the Principles, the Principles will govern.
<br>
<br>
<b>Information We Collect</b>
<br>
<br>
We collect personal information when you subscribe to one of our newsletters, download a trial version of a product, or purchase a product or service from us or from our partners. The type of information we collect may vary based upon the way we interact with you. For example, if you sign up for a newsletter we may only collect your name and email address. However, if you make a purchase from us then we may also collect your credit card number and physical address in order to complete the purchase and deliver any physical products. We may combine information that we have about you with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. SUPERAntiSpyware automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, SUPERAntiSpyware cookie information, and pages you request. This is done as part of regular internet communication between a browser and a web site.
<br>
<br>
<b>How We Use Collected Information</b>
<br>

SUPERAntiSpyware uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, provide and improve our services, contact you, conduct research, check entitlement for a product, and provide reporting for internal and external clients.
<br>
<br>
<b>CONSENT</b>
<br>
<br>
BY USING OUR SITE, PRODUCTS, OR SERVICES, YOU CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRIVACY POLICY. BECAUSE WE OPERATE GLOBALLY, WE MAKE INFORMATION WE GATHER AVAILABLE TO OUR WORLDWIDE BUSINESS UNITS. FOR THOSE OF YOU VISITING US FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, CANADA, OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU ENTER WILL BE TRANSFERRED OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION OR YOUR HOME COUNTRY FOR USE BY US AND OUR AFFILIATES FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED IN THIS POLICY. YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED AND STORED IN THE UNITED STATES, AND AS A RESULT, GOVERNMENTS, COURTS, OR LAW ENFORCEMENT OR REGULATORY AGENCIES MAY BE ABLE TO OBTAIN DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION THROUGH LAWS APPLICABLE IN THE UNITED STATES. BY USING OUR SITE, PRODUCTS, OR SERVICES AND PROVIDING US WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOU CONSENT TO THIS TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.

<br>
We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with SUPERAntiSpyware under confidentiality agreements.

<br>
<br>
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
<br>
<br>
We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of SUPERAntiSpyware’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

SUPERAntiSpyware may display targeted offers based on personal information. Advertisers may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted offers meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.
<br>
<br>
SUPERAntiSpyware does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or complete a targeted offer. By interacting with or viewing an offer, however, you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
