            Our Privacy Policy applies to and governs all websites, games, online services, and software made available at all websites owned and operated by JumpStart Games, Inc. (collectively, the “Sites” and, individually, “Site”), on mobile devices, tablets, personal computers and other devices.   By accessing any of the Sites, you are consenting to this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy describes what information the Sites collect from users, including children, when they visit the Sites; how such information is used and stored; when such information may be disclosed to third parties; how users, parents, and guardians can control the use and disclosure of collected information; and how information is protected.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our users’ privacy is important to us, and we recognize the need to provide additional privacy protection for children on the Sites permitting such users. Our privacy practices are guided by the United States' Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, as well as data privacy laws in the United States and other applicable countries. In all cases, younger users should always check with their parents or guardians before entering information on any website or mobile application and we encourage families to discuss their household guidelines regarding the online sharing of personal information. In order for a child to fully participate on any of the Sites, no personally identifiable information is collected from a child until such time as verifiable parental consent is received from the child’s parent or guardian. For more information about how the Sites deal with users under the age of 13, click <a href="/customercare/privacy-policy/ka-and-coppa" title="KA and COPPA">here</a>. In order to register on our site as a user, the child’s parent or guardian must activate their account. Users may choose to play as Guests with no information collected, nor game play history recorded and prizes or gems collected may not be available upon the users return.

Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.</p>

Contests and Sweepstakes:&nbsp;</strong>The Sites may offer online contests and sweepstakes. To enter these contests and sweepstakes, you may be required to provide your first name and email address and/or additional information required for the management of the contest or sweepstakes. For children under the age of 13, we may collect the child’s e-mail address to enter the child in the contest or sweepstakes, store such child’s email address for the duration of the sweepstakes, and use it for notification if he or she is the winner. For certain contests or sweepstakes on such sites, we may ask for the email address of the child's parent or guardian to inform the parent or guardian of his or her child's entry and give the parent or guardian the option to have the child's entry deleted.</p>

Electronic Postcards and Messages:&nbsp; </strong>The Sites may provide users the opportunity to send electronic postcards and “wish lists” of items they want to family or friends, which means we will send, on the user’s behalf, email messages to family and/or friends. To do so, users must provide the email address of the recipient of such electronic postcards or email messages. Users must only provide email addresses of people who they know would be happy to receive such electronic postcards or email messages. Email addresses provided to us for this purpose are used solely to send the requested postcard or email message and are deleted from our system once the postcard or message is sent. In some cases, we may offer users an incentive (e.g., points to be used in an online game) for referring information about products to the user's family or friends. In such cases, we will comply with all applicable legal requirements. Please note that this feature may not be available to users in certain regions or countries.</p>

Interactive Features and Services:&nbsp; </strong>Some of the Sites may offer interactive features and services, such as message boards, chat rooms, electronic mail services, comment boxes, messaging services, and member profile pages.

        <p><strong><a name="sectioniwireless"></a>I. Wireless Marketing Services: </strong>Consistent with local law, appropriately aged users may have the opportunity to register for special promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and/or wireless devices. To do so, users may be asked to provide their telephone number, email address, carrier’s name, and/or their opinion regarding certain goods and/or services. Users must opt in to receive wireless marketing material from businesses within JumpStart Games' companies through one of the following methods: (a) filling out the registration information on any The Sites’ wireless marketing registration page; or (b) sending a specific word, code or symbol via a text message to a telephone number designated by us in any promotional material. The user may also be asked to confirm his or her acceptance to receive such wireless marketing services.</p>

        <p>Users that register for wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from the Sites or JumpStart Games' companies. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. Under no circumstances will  JumpStart Games' companies be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by such user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email address.</p>

        <p><strong><a name="sectionij"></a>J.  Geolocation Information: </strong>We may collect and store information about your geographic location, but we will only collect precise geolocation infrmation sufficient to identify street name and name of a city or town on The Sites that either are directed to users over the age of 13 and only if you enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. You may be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with such information. We use this information, for example, to enable users to take advantage of Site offerings; respond to user’s requests for products, services, and information; manage games; customize the content users see when visiting the Sites; and to offer users special offers and promotions from The Sites and JumpStart Games' companies, as well as on behalf of selected third parties offering products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to our users. By accepting this Privacy Policy and using the applicable Site, you hereby consent to the collection and storage of such geolocation information as described above.</p>

        <p><strong><a name="sectionik"></a>K. Financial Information: </strong>We collect and use financial information, such as credit card numbers and security codes, for the limited purposes described below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Consumer Products: Certain of the Sites provide pages and/or links to pages offering users who are of legal age to form a binding contract the opportunity to purchase consumer products (the "Shops"). To do so, users need to provide contact, shipping, billing and credit information.  These pages may be hosted and operated by a third party that is independent and separate from the Sites. This third party collects personal information about shop users and may share this information with us.  We use this information to process the order and to send order confirmations via email, as well as to send information about products and services of interest and as otherwise required by law. Before providing information on these pages, we encourage you to review the posted privacy policies which govern such third party’s use of your information, as they may differ from ours. </li>
<li>Virtual Items/Memberships: Some of the Sites may offer memberships, online subscriptions and/or virtual items for use in conjunction with the Sites' games. When you enter into a transaction for a membership, subscription, virtual item or similar transaction, you may be asked to provide the credit card and/or billing information and email address. We will use this information to fulfill your specified requests, as well as to inform you about additional products or service opportunities and as otherwise required by law.  Please also see the information regarding payment processors in Section II(B) below.</li>
</ol>
        <p><strong><a name="sectionil"></a>L. Other Data Collection and Use.</strong></p>
<p>We collect search query information when users search for information on the Sites. We also collect information from users when they contact us with questions and comments.</p>
<p>We may use this information, along with any of the other information described above, to (i) analyze use of the Sites and understand and improve our service offerings; (ii) prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; and (iii) for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or pursuant to your consent.</p>
        <p>We may combine information collected through the Sites with information we collect from other sources (e.g., social media integration services), other JumpStart Games' company’s sites, offline records or publicly available information). It is your responsibility to provide complete and accurate information and to keep such information up to date. We are not responsible for any problem or liability arising from your failure to do so.</p>

        <h2><a name="sectionii"></a>II. DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES.</h2>

<p>We may share your information with third parties for the limited purposes described below. In the U.S., parents of children under the age of 13 have the option of consenting to the collection and use of their child's personal information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to certain third parties.</p>

        <p>
            <strong><a name="sectioniia"></a>A.  Law Enforcement and Safety.</strong><br>
            You acknowledge, consent, and agree to the extent legally permissible in your jurisdiction to allow us to access, preserve, and/or disclose the information we collect and/or content you provide to us (including information you may have posted on bulletin boards or internal site communication systems) to a law enforcement agency or other third parties if required to do so by law or with a good faith belief that such access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the Terms of Use of the respective The Sites; (c) respond to claims that the content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the owners of the Sites, any user of the Sites, a third party or the general public.  We also may disclose user information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability; to protect or defend our rights or property; or protect the safety, rights, or property of others.
        </p>
        <p>If you have concerns about the conduct of a particular user, please send an e-mail to privacy@jumpstart.com. This email is not to contact us about the status of your account. </p>

        <p>
            <strong><a name="sectioniib"></a>B.  Agents.</strong><br>
            Information collected through the Sites may be transferred, disclosed or shared with third parties engaged by us to handle and deliver certain activities, such as message boards, sweepstakes and contests, e-cards, payment processing, newsletters, and advisory boards, and to perform other technical and processing functions, such as sending postal mail and email, maintaining data integrity, programming operations, user services or technology services.  We may provide these third parties information collected as needed to perform their functions, but they are prohibited from using it for other purposes and specifically agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information.  Some of these agents, such as payment processors, may request additional information during the course of offering their services.  Before you provide additional information to third party agents, we encourage users to review their privacy policies and information collection practices.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong><a name="sectioniic"></a>C.  Third Parties/Advertisers.</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>JumpStart Games uses the services of third parties who may collect, use or disclose cookie information, IP addresses or other identifiers from devices and/or browsers of users who visit The Sites. For a list of these third parties on The Sites, please go <a href="/customercare/privacy-policy/third-party-information-collection-through-our-sites-and-applications" title="Third Party Information Collection">here</a>.  Some The Sites partner with outside third parties to provide you with additional content, products, or services that we believe may be of interest. For example, we may partner with a greeting card company, software manufacturer, social media plugin provider, or mobile phone provider to offer you electronic cards, games, social networking, or text messaging services. These partners operate websites and services that are separate and independent from the Sites and, accordingly, may have their own privacy policies.  If you consent or register with one of our partners, that means you grant the Sites permission to give your registration and other information, including e-mail address, to that third party.  If you have identified yourself as residing in the EU, we will not share your email address or other personally identifiable information with third parties for advertising purposes unless you have "opted-in."</p>

<p>In addition, Third Party Advertising Service Providers may use their own Tracking Technologies to gather information about you. Please see Section I(D) above for more detailed information regarding such use of Tracking Technologies.</p>

        <p>For more information on our use of third party advertisers and the self-regulatory principles, please click <a href="/customercare/privacy-policy/advertizing-option-icon-request" title="Advertizing Option Icon Request">here</a>. </p>

        <p>
            <strong><a name="sectioniid"></a>D. Co-Branded Sites and Features</strong><br>
            Some Sites offer co-branded services and features, such as events and promotions that we put together with another company ("Co-Branded Partner"). Such services may be hosted on a Site and/or our Co-Branded Partner's website. We may share your information with our Co-Branded Partner and your voluntary use of or participation in a co-branded service or feature means that you opt-in and affirmatively consent to both the Sites and our Co-Branded Partner collecting and using the information you provided during registration and/or in connection with the specific co-branded feature for fulfillment, marketing or administrative purposes. If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner's future use of your information for marketing purposes, you will need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly. The Co-Branded Partner will be identified on the co-branded feature or service.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong><a name="sectioniie"></a>E.  JumpStart Games and Other Affiliated Businesses</strong><br>
            The Sites are part of JumpStart Games, Inc. Where permitted by law, we may share information we collect about you within the websites of JumpStart Games' companies’ and other affiliated businesses so that we can, for example, provide you with information about products and services that might interest you.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong><a name="sectioniif"></a>F. Business Transfer</strong><br>
            In the event that assets relating to one or more of the Sites are transferred or sold to another entity as a result of, for example, a corporate sale, merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, information collected at the Sites may be transferred to the acquiring company.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong><a name="sectioniig"></a>G. With Your Consent</strong><br>
            We may otherwise disclose your information pursuant to your consent.
        </p>

        <h2><a name="sectioniii"></a>III.  INTERNATIONAL USERS.</h2>
        <br>
        Please be aware that by providing us with personal information, (1) you understand and agree that your personal information may be stored on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction; (2) to the extent you are a resident of a country other than the United States, you consent to the storage of such data in the United States for processing by our affiliates in accordance with this Privacy Policy and (3) the Privacy Policy and the collection of information pursuant to the Privacy Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.
        <p></p>

<p>If you do not consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Sites because your use of the Sites represents your consent.  If you have already provided personal information, please contact us about how you would like us to handle such information. </p>

        <h2><a name="sectioniv"></a>IV.  SECURITY, STORAGE AND RETENTION OF INFORMATION.</h2>
        <br>
        The Sites maintain reasonable technical and organizational steps to help ensure that information collected is secure, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers and use of electronic security systems and password protections which guard against unauthorized access. The Sites conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions. We limit access to user’s information to employees and contractors who are authorized for the proper handling of such information, and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We also take reasonable steps to help make sure our third-party agents protect the security of your personal information. However, as with most Internet sites or services, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully access such personal information through a number of means despite our efforts.<p></p>

<p>Information collected at the Sites will not be stored for longer than is necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or to otherwise meet legal requirements.</p>

        <h2><a name="sectionv"></a>V.  ACCESSING AND CORRECTING INFORMATION; TERMINATION OF WIRELESS SERVICES.</h2>

            You have the right to access, update and correct factual inaccuracies in personally identifiable information that we collect online at the Sites, subject to certain exceptions.  To do so, you should log into your account or you may e-mail us at

            <strong><a name="sectionvb"></a>B. Parental Access</strong><br>
            Parents/guardians of children under the age of 13 can print out and mail or fax us a signed form that allows them to review any personally identifiable information collected with their permission, about their child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of their child's personally identifiable information. You can download the form <a href="/customercare/privacy-policy/knowledge-adventure-personal-information-access-inquiry-form" title="Download the Form Here">here</a>. We will take steps to verify the identity of anyone requesting personally identifiable information about a child and to ensure that the person is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian.

        <p>
            <strong><a name="sectionvc"></a>C. Termination of Wireless Services</strong><br>
            If you have registered for wireless services, you may cancel one or more wireless services via your wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by the Sites at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT".  The Sites will terminate your registration for the most recent wireless service you received. Any of these words followed by the word "ALL" in the user's termination request will cancel all of the user's registered wireless services with the Sites. If you unsubscribe from one or all of wireless service(s) via your wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel your previous opt-in.
        </p>

        <h2><a name="sectionvi"></a>VI.  ONLINE SAFETY.</h2>
        <br>
        Some of the Sites offer you and your child an online safety guide which we encourage you to use as starting point for discussing safety and privacy concerns with your child. Of course, involvement in your family’s online lives is the most important safety tool available. Some of the various guides are available by clicking <a href="/customercare/privacy-policy/knowledge-adventure-online-safety-guide" tile="KA Online Safety Guide">here</a>.<p></p>

        The websites that comprise the Sites may contain links to other sites, including those of sponsors, advertisers, social networking platforms, and survey companies.
