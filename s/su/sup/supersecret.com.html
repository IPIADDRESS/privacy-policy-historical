                out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when online. Teenagers under the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage their parents to

            </p>
            <h2>Who is collecting your information?</h2>

                be notified at the time the information is collected. If you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information

            </p>
            <h2>With whom may your personal information be shared?</h2>
            <p>
                We may need to disclose your personal information to third party vendors to fulfill product orders or prizes, to process mailings, or to process, analyze and/or store data. 
                We will attempt to ensure that these entities do not use your personal information for any other purpose, and that they have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, 
                security and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law or in special 
                cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against you if you are violating the

                rights or property, other users of our sites, applications or products, or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities.

                we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service 
                and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible. Similarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, 
                or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to our successor or assign.
            </p>
            <p>

                please be aware that the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.
            </p>
