								</p></li><li>Your medical profile
									<ul type="a" start="a">

									</li></ul><p>
								</p></li><li>Our use of Cookies and other information gathering technologies
									<ul type="a" start="a">
										<li>Cookies are a small amount of information stored by a browser on your computer the first time you access a site. This is a standard procedure which enables the browser to identify and remember information about you. Cookies used on this site give you a numeric ID and record the time you accessed the web site. 
										</li><li>We also record on our web site server the IP address of your computer, what pages you looked at, whether we were able to provide those pages to you, the size of file we sent to you, the previous content requested by you and the type of web browser you use.

										</li><li>This information is only used for us to improve our website by showing us what information is most frequently looked at. We are not able to identify you personally from this information and we will not use this information for marketing purposes.
									</li></ul><p>
								</p></li><li>How we protect your information
									<ul type="a" start="a">
										<li>The internet is not a secure medium.  However we have put in place various security procedures as set out in this policy, based on British Standard BS7799. 
										</li><li>The servers on which our site is hosted are contained in a secure building.  Only authorised personnel may access them. The database on which information is held about you is situated on a firewall protected network (our "production network"). The firewalls are used to block unauthorised traffic to the production network. There is no connectivity between this server and our internal corporate servers. We do that to try to ensure that only people with authorised access to production computers can access your information. All computers on the production network reside in a room protected by a code security system and all production computers also require a user login ID and password in order to access them.
										</li><li>We also keep your information confidential. Our own internal procedures cover the storage, access and disclosure of your information.
									</li></ul><p>
								</p></li><li>Sale of business								
								In the event that this business is sold or integrated with another business your details will be passed on to the new owners of the business. <p>
								
								</p></li><li>Updating your details								
								If any of the information that you have provided to us changes, for example if you change your e-mail address, name or other details you can let us know the correct details by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:customercare@superdrug.com">customercare@superdrug.com</a> or by using the edit function to change your personal profile on the website.<p>
								
								</p></li><li>Your consent	
									<ul type="a" start="a">

Continued use of the service will signify that you agree to any such changes. 
										</li><li>If you provide us with your medical profile, we ask you to consent expressly to the use of your information as set out in this policy the first time you register with us. If you register a medical profile for another person, you must ensure they consent to you giving us their details and that they read our privacy policy.
										</li><li>Because the Internet infrastructure is global the information you provide may be transferred outside the European Economic Area that do not have similar data protection legislation during use as set out in this policy.
