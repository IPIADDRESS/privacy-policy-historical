<p align="left"><strong>Privacy  Policy</strong> (updated 9/23/08)<br>
  This website, located  at <strong><a href="http://www.supercrossonline.com/">www.supercrossonline.com</a> </strong>(the  "Site"), is owned and operated by Feld Entertainment, Inc. ("FEI" "we,"  "us"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy (the  "Privacy Policy") outlines the types of Personally Identifiable  Information (as defined below) that we gather while you are visiting the Site,  as well as ways in which we process and disseminate such Personally  Identifiable Information. This Privacy Policy does not pertain to information  collected on any other site owned by FEI, its subsidiaries or other  businesses, nor does it extend to the privacy practices (or lack thereof) of  third parties. We cannot and do not assume responsibility for the policies,  practices and actions of such third parties. You are, of course, free to use  much of the Site without providing any Personally Identifiable Information to  us.<br>
  <br>
  We comply with the privacy laws and regulations of the United States of America. We make no representation that  this Site is governed by or operated in accordance with the laws of other  nations, or that the Site or any part thereof is appropriate or available for  use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Site do so  on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for  complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. By using this Site,  visitors from outside of the United States of America acknowledge this Site is subject  to the laws and regulations of the United States of America, and waive any claims that may  arise under their own national laws. <br>
  <br>
  We reserve the right to change, modify, add, or remove provisions of this  Privacy Policy. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted here, and we  encourage you to check back from time to time to ensure continuing familiarity  with the most current version of our Privacy Policy. You can determine whether  the Privacy Policy has been revised since your previous visit to the Site by  referring to the "Last Updated" legend at the top of this page.  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of this Site constitutes  your acceptance to be bound by this Privacy Policy without limitation,  qualification or change. If at any time you do not accept all the terms and  conditions contained herein, you must immediately discontinue use of this Site. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>1. What Information We Collect</strong><br>
  FEI gathers two basic types of  information through the Site: "Personally Identifiable Information"  (or "PII") and "Non-Personally Identifiable Information" (or  "Non-PII"). PII is information that identifies or can identify you as an  individual (such as residential address, telephone number, or billing  information) and Non-PII is aggregated information, demographic information, IP  addresses and any other information that does not reveal your specific  identity.<br>
  <br>
  a. Non-Personally Identifiable Information - When you visit and interact with  the Site, FEI and third parties with whom we have contracted to provide services to  us may collect Non-PII (for example, a catalog of the Site pages you visit).  Non-PII is anonymous and does not  identify you personally. Non-PII is generally collected through  the Site from four different sources: Internet protocol addresses and web logs;  cookies; pixel tags and other similar technologies; and other Non-PII that you voluntarily provide (as  explained below).<br>
  <br>
  i. IP Protocol Addresses and Web Logs - This Site's web servers automatically  collect the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and log files of visitors. Your IP  address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned to your  computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and  logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along  with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. This  information is collected in an aggregate form only and does not contain any PII. We use your IP address, and the  IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping  diagnose problems with the Site's servers, and administering the Site.  Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done  automatically by many websites. <br>
  <br>
  ii. Cookies - We and our service providers may use a standard technology called  a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the Site. Cookies  reside on your computer and help the Site recognize your computer's browser as  a previous visitor. In addition, on occasion our Site may also set a  "session cookie" which helps us administer the Site. The session  cookie expires when you close your browser and does not retain any information  about you after it expires. If you do not want information collected through  the use of cookies, you should be able to modify your browser preference to  provide you with choices relating to cookies. For example, if you use a  standard browser, you should have the choice to accept all cookies, to be  notified when a cookie is set or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject  cookies, you may be unable to use certain Site services (e.g., those services  that require you to log on to the Site in order to participate). For more  information on modifying your browser preference, please refer to the  documentation accompanying your browser. <br>
  <br>
  iii. Pixel Tags - We and our service providers may also use so-called  "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or  similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") in connection with some  Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, compile  aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. A Pixel Tag is an  electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to  Site visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors' hard drives.  Pixel Tags do not contain any PII and allow us to count users who  have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to  help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When  used in HTML-formatted email messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether  and when an email has been opened. <br>
  <br>
  iv. Information You Voluntarily Provide - We may also collect certain  information (e.g., your geographic location, your genre preferences etc.) when  you voluntarily provide such information to us. When such information is not  combined with any PII, such information is considered to be Non-PII, as it does not personally  identify you or any other user. Additionally, we may aggregate PII in a manner such that the  end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for  example, by using PII to calculate the percentage of our users who have a  particular telephone area code. Such aggregate information is considered Non-PII for purposes of this Policy. <br>
  <br>
  b. Personally Identifiable Information - You may use many features of this Site  without providing any PII. However, in order to take advantage of particular  opportunities made available through the Site (for example, to access  additional services provided by this Site such as concert updates, chat room  forums and/or personalized content) we may require that you furnish PII to us such as: your name, postal  address, telephone number, fax number email address, age, gender, credit card  number or other payment account number and health-related information (for  example, physically disabled seating requests). Please keep in mind that you  may also be providing PII when you submit comments through chat rooms, forums,  message boards or news groups, although we do not collect or use PII from these sources. We collect PII from you through the Site only  when you voluntarily provide it. <br>
  <strong><br>
    2. How Information We Collect Is Used</strong><br>
  a. Non-Personally Identifiable Information - Because Non-PII does not personally identify you,  we may use such information for any purpose. For example, we may use Non-PII to measure the number of visits,  average time spent on the Site and pages viewed as well as to diagnose problems  with our servers and to administer the Site. We may then use this information  to analyze and improve the features and functionality of this Site. We may use  non-PII information about you and other  Site visitors on an aggregate basis to sell and deliver advertising, promotions  and content that we believe will be of interest to you. <br>
  <br>
  In addition, we reserve the right to share such Non-PII, which does not personally  identify you, with third parties, for any purpose. For example, we may share  information with advertisers or other third parties that are not part of the FEI family on an aggregate or other  basis that does not disclose any of your PII. <br>
  <br>
  In some instances, we may combine Non-PII with PII (such as embedding email  addresses in cookies). If we do combine any Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be  treated as PII as long as it is so combined. This "combined" PII is not shared with third parties,  except as described in this Policy.<br>
  <br>
  b. Personally Identifiable Information <br>
  i. Site: We may use PII you give us to better tailor your website experience to  your interests, and to show you content in which you may be interested and to  display the content according to your preferences. We may also share your PII within the FEI business family in order to  enhance your experience on other FEI websites. To the extent we do so,  we make sure that your PII receives the same level of protection throughout the FEI business family. Please note that  such sharing may involve the collection use, storage, or disclosure of PII outside the United States of America.<br>
  <br>
  ii. Communications: If you choose to opt-in, we may use your PII to send you information about FEI and its services as well as  promotional material on behalf of some of our affiliates, vendors or  advertisers. If at any time you change your mind and prefer to no longer  receive such marketing communications from us, please see the "Opt-In  Policy" section below. <br>
  <br>
  iii. Administrative Matters: FEI reserves the right to contact you in the event  of a change in the Site's Terms of Use and/or this Privacy Policy, or to notify  you of other administrative matters in connection with the Site (e.g.,  contacting you to facilitate, complete or confirm a transaction). Because this  information may be important to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of  receiving such communications.<br>
  <br>
  iv. Fulfillment of Requests: FEI may use your PII to fulfill the purpose for  which such PII was provided (e.g., to confirm your registration or fulfill your  purchase). <br>
  <br>
  v. Facilitation of Transactions: Please note that, at times, forms on the Site  may be pre-populated with your PII in order to facilitate a transaction between  you and FEI. <br>
  <br>
  vi. Internal Business Purposes: We may also use your PII for our internal  business purposes, such as to target advertising, for data analysis, for audits  and for other internal purposes.<br>
  <br>
  vii. Shopping/Commercial Services: This Site may offer merchandise and/or  ticket purchase services, which may be offered by us or by one of our  e-commerce vendors. To the extent the merchandise and/or ticket purchase  services are offered by one of our e-commerce vendors, such e-commerce vendors  will be collecting and using the PII you provide. For more information  regarding your transactions with our e-commerce vendors, please refer to  Section 4(b) below.<br>
  <br>
  To the extent FEI is the entity offering the purchase services, when you make a  purchase through the Site, we may collect your credit card number or other  payment account number (for example, your PayPal account number), billing  address and other information related to such purchase (collectively,  "Payment Information") from you. We will use the Payment Information  that you provide to bill you for your purchase and to fulfill your purchase. By  providing your Payment Information, you are authorizing us to give that  information to third parties as necessary to confirm and fulfill your order  (for example, to process your credit card or payment account number and to send  you products you have ordered). <br>
  <br>
  viii.  Email This to a Friend: The Site may allow you to forward certain items posted  on Site or links to Site features by email or Instant Messenger to other  parties who you believe may be interested. If you wish to use this feature, you  may provide us with such other party's email address or Instant Messenger  screen name so that we can facilitate your sending of such message to such  other party. To do so, any PII you provide in connection with sending such  other party the message, such as your name and your email address or Instant  Messenger screen name, will, of course, be disclosed to such other party.  While, due to technical restrictions, the recipient's email address or Instant  Messenger screen names may be retained in our log files, we do not knowingly  share it with third parties and we do not use this PII for any purpose except  to send this message (unless the recipient has already consented to such use of  his/her PII). <br>
  <br>
  ix. Online Surveys/Sweepstakes and Contests: From time to time, we conduct  online surveys and offer online sweepstakes or contests on the Site (each, a  "Promotion"), and we may collect PII in connection with the same. We  may use your PII to contact you regarding your Promotion entry, or to contact  you if you win a Promotion (if applicable). You should carefully review the  rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate through the Site, as  they may contain additional important information about FEI's use of your PII.  To the extent such rules conflict with this Privacy Policy, such rules will  govern that particular Promotion. <br>
  <strong><br>
    3. How Personally Identifiable Information We Collect Is Disclosed</strong><br>
  a. Affiliate Communications: If you choose to opt-in, we may share your PII  with our affiliates, including FEI owned, operated or managed venues where FEI  produced events occur and promoters or sponsors of FEI events, so that our  affiliates may send you announcements and notifications of events, products or  services that might be of interest to you. For further information, please see  the "Opt-In Policy" section below. <br>
  <br>
  b. Third Party Communications: If you choose to opt-in, we may also share your  PII with third parties to allow such third parties to send promotional  communications to you. For further information, please see the "Opt-In  Policy" section below. <br>
  <br>
  c. FEI Service Providers: We work with third parties who provide services  including but not limited to data analysis, order fulfillment, credit card  processing and other services of an administrative nature. If you use our  services, we reserve the right to share your PII with such third parties for  the purpose of enabling these third parties to provide such services. We take  reasonable steps to ensure these third parties treat PII in a manner comparable  to how we do so. <br>
  <br>
  d. Public  Forums and Other Interactive Features: Please be aware that when you disclose  PII in a chat room, forum, message board or news groups on the Site, the  information may become public and accessible to all or a part of the Site  community, so it is important for you to exercise discretion and appropriate  caution when deciding to reveal PII in these areas. In addition, when you  choose to make a posting on such services, certain PII may be available for  other users to view. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when  deciding to disclose your PII, or any other information, on the Site. WE ARE  NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF ANY PII YOU VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE THROUGH THE  SITE VIA THESE FORUMS AND OTHER INTERACTIVE FEATURES. Please note that we  reserve the right, but have no obligation, to republish content posted in a  chat room, forum, message board or news group (including any PII contained  therein) as further set forth in our Terms of Use Agreement. <br>
  <br>
  In the event that you encounter any Site user who you believe is improperly  collecting or using information about you or other users, please visit our Help  Page to send us an email about such collection or use.<br>
  <br>
  e. Online Surveys/Sweepstakes and Contests: We reserve the right to share PII  collected in connection with Promotions with the third-party sponsors of any  such Promotions (irrespective of whether such Promotions are hosted by us), or  otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to such Promotion. You should  carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate  through the Site, as they may contain additional important information about a  sponsor's or other third parties' use of your PII. To the extent such rules  conflict with this Privacy Policy, such rules will govern that particular  Promotion. <br>
  <br>
  f. Compliance With Applicable Law: FEI may also access and disclose PII as  needed to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental  inquiries or requests; (3) comply with valid legal process; (4) protect the  rights, privacy, safety or property of FEI, Site visitors or the public; (5)  permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may  sustain; and (6) enforce our Terms of Use or other published guidelines.<br>
  <br>
  g. Assignment: We reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we  collect from users of the Site to a third party in the event of any  reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other  disposition of all or any portion of FEI's business, assets or stock (including  without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). <br>
  <br>
  <strong>4. Collection of Information By Third Parties</strong><br>
  a. Co-Branded Pages - We may enter into relationships with "powered  by" third-party vendors, advertisers, sponsors, and co-branded sites  (referred to here as "co-branded pages"). These might include, for  example, pages that share our name and that of another entity. You should look  for a specific privacy policy on any such co-branded page. Any PII that you  provide when signing up at any co-branded page may be collected by, or shared  with, such third party. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, the  third partyâs use of your PII. You should check the websites for each such  third party for information regarding their privacy policies. <br>
  <br>
  b. Transactions With E-Commerce Vendors and Advertisers - When you provide PII  to one of our Site's e-commerce vendors or advertisers, this transaction will  occur in connection with the site of the e-commerce vendor or advertiser, not  on the Site, and, as such, the PII you provide is collected pursuant to and  controlled by the privacy policy of such e-commerce vendor or advertiser. FEI  is not responsible for such parties' privacy policies and we encourage you to  familiarize yourself with the applicable privacy policy of the e-commerce site  with which you transact business or to contact the operator of such site for more  information. <br>
  <br>
  Please be aware that at times, at the request of or on behalf of our e-commerce  vendors or advertisers, FEI may "pre-populate" forms with your PII  for your review, and, if you so choose, for submission to such e-commerce  vendors or advertisers. Accordingly, we encourage you to review each  pre-populated form carefully before agreeing to submit your PII to determine  who is seeking to collect your information, and to familiarize yourself with  the applicable privacy policy governing use of any PII collected about you. <br>
  <br>
  c. Job Postings - If you choose to respond to a job posting on the Site, you  may be directed to a third-party site (for example, a third-party site  specializing in job postings, such as Monster.com). Any PII you provide will be  collected by such third party. We have no control over, and are not responsible  or liable for, such third party's use of your PII. Please consult such third  party's privacy policy for information regarding their privacy practices. <br>
  The third party collecting your PII will share such PII with FEI so that FEI  can review your information and, if applicable, respond to your query or job  application. Please note that FEI has no obligation to respond to all queries  or job applications submitted. Any PII that FEI receives from such third party  will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. <br>
  <br>
  d. Third Party Advertising - The ads appearing on this Site are delivered to  you by third-party advertisers. Non-PII about your visits to this Site, such as  number of times you have viewed an ad, is used to serve ads to you. In the  course of serving advertisements to this Site, our third-party advertisers may  place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. <br>
  <br>
  e. Third  Party Links - The Site may contain links to third-party Internet websites,  which are not owned or operated by FEI. We provide such links only as a  convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement  of the linked site by FEI. If you provide any PII through any such third-party  website, your transaction will occur on such third party's website (not the  Site) and the PII you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy  policy of, that third party. We are not responsible for the privacy practices  or the content of such third-party websites, including such websites' use of  any PII that you provide to them. We  strongly encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of those  sites. <br>
  <br>
  <strong><em>PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION  PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES. </em></strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>5. Opt-In Policy</strong><br>
  a. FEI Communications - When you supply FEI with PII, from time-to-time, in FEI's discretion, you may be asked to  indicate whether you are interested in receiving information from us about  special offers in connection with the Site, FEI, our affiliates, vendors or advertisers.  If you do choose to opt-in to receive such communications, we may, from time to  time, send you marketing communications. If at any time you change your mind  and no longer wish to receive marketing communications from us, you may opt-out  of such marketing communications by either: <br>
  <br>
  "Using the link provided in our newsletters or commercial email messages  to opt-out of receiving further marketing communications from usâ; or <br>
  "Changing your contact preference to "Do Not Contact Me" at any  time by using the "Ask a Question" tab on our Help Page. <br>
  <br>
  If you decide to contact us to change your contact preference to "Do Not  Contact Me", FEI will implement this change in a reasonable time frame. Please  be aware that your requested change will not be effective until FEI implements such change, and such  requests will be implemented only in connection with your Site profile, and  will not impact any preferences you may have made to any other site controlled,  owned or operated by FEI or its affiliates.<br>
  <br>
  b. Affiliate and Third Party Communications - From time-to-time in FEI's discretion, you may be provided  with the opportunity to opt-in to receive offers directly from FEI, our affiliates and/or from third  parties. If you do choose to accept any such offer(s), any PII provided to FEI for such purposes may be shared  with our affiliates and such third-parties, to allow our affiliates and/or such  third parties to provide you with such offers. If you change your mind and  would prefer that we no longer share your PII with our affiliates and/or with  third parties for their marketing purposes, you may opt-out of such future  sharing at any time by using the "Ask a Question" tab on our Help  Page, and specifying which choice you are opting out from, provided however,  you may not be able to opt out of certain third party offers that are displayed  on our Site. <br>
  <br>
  c. Allowing FEI to share PII with affiliates for their marketing purposes and/or  Allowing FEI to share PII with third-party companies for their marketing purposes -  Please note that if you opt-out as described above, (i) we will not be able to  remove your PII from the databases of affiliates or third parties with which we have  already shared your PII (i.e., to which we have already provided your PII as of the date that we implement  your opt-out request), therefore you must contact such affiliates or third  parties directly in order to opt-out of further marketing communications made  directly from them or utilize the opt-out mechanisms set forth in their  respective privacy policies or marketing messages; and (ii) you may still be  presented new offers from FEI and/or its affiliates or third parties while you are  within the Site, including offers from those third parties which you have  opted-out of receiving direct offers; but in connection with each new offer  within the Site you will have the right not to accept such offers. In the event  you receive an offer from a third party through our Site, but choose not to  accept it, your PII will not be shared. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>6. Use of This Site by Children </strong>- The Site is not directed to  individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that such  individuals do not provide PII through the Site. If a parent or guardian becomes aware  that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information  without the parent or guardian's consent by, for example, misrepresenting his  or her age, that parent or guardian should contact us at <strong><a href="mailto:motorsports@feldinc.com">motorsports@feldinc.com</a></strong>. If FEI determines that it has collected  personal information of children under the age of 13, FEI will immediately delete such  information and any accounts believed to be held by children under 13. Please  see our Terms of Use for additional information regarding the use of this Site  by minors.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>7. Accessing, Updating or Deleting Information Collected About You</strong> -  This Site also gives you the opportunity to modify or remove PII that you have provided to us by  way of this Site. You may do so by modifying your password-protected registered  user information on the Site. To the extent that such information is stored in  our databases, we will respond to your changes as soon as reasonably possible,  although please understand that although this information, once deleted, is not  available on the Site, that information may remain stored indefinitely in our  backup and archival records. To the extent that such information is not stored  in our databases, we cannot always ensure that these corrections or deletions  will reach such other databases in a timely manner. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>8. Security of Your </strong><strong>PII</strong><strong> </strong>- FEI employs reasonable security  measures consistent with standard industry practice, for PII collected through this Site,  including physical, electronic and operational measures to maintain security  and prevent unauthorized access. While FEI takes all appropriate steps to  safeguard PII under our control, unfortunately, no data transmission over the  Internet or method of storing data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As  such, we cannot guarantee that PII supplied by users will not be  accessed on our servers, or intercepted while being transmitted to us over the  Internet. We assume no liability for any damages you may suffer as a result of  interception, alteration or misuse of information during such transfers. If you  have reason to believe that there has been any breach of the security of the  Site, please contact us at <strong><a href="mailto:motorsports@feldinc.com">motorsports@feldinc.com</a>.&nbsp; </strong>Please remember that security of the  username and password you create when you register with the Site is your  responsibility; we recommend that you do not share them with anyone. If you  share your username and password, you are providing access to your PII. You will be responsible for all  uses of your registration, whether or not authorized by you. You agree to  immediately notify FEI of any unauthorized use of your username or password.<br>
  <br>
