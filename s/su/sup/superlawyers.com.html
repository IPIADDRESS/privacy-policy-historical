							<h4 id="personal_information">WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES SUPER LAWYERS COLLECT AND HOW DO WE USE IT?</h4>
							<p>We collect information about our users in three ways: directly from the user, from our web server logs and through cookies. We use the information primarily to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers the information, resources and services that are most relevant and helpful to you.

							<p>If you contact us for customer support, we may ask you to provide information about your computer or about the issues you are trying to resolve. This information is necessary to help us answer your questions. We may record your requests and our responses for quality control purposes.</p>
							<p>Our website may include areas in which users may post content and information, including personal and business profile data, messages, comments and other information.

							<br>
							<h4>Cookies</h4>
							<p>In order to offer and provide a customized and personal service, we may use cookies to store and help track information about you. Cookies are simply small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to help remind us who you are and to help you navigate our sites during your visits.

							<p>The use of cookies is relatively standard. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. However, if you prefer, you can set your browser to either notify you when you receive a cookie or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that some features of many sites may not function properly if you don't accept cookies.</p>

							<br>
							<h4>Third Party Services</h4>
							<p>We may use services hosted by third parties, such as Google Analytics, to assist in providing our services and to help us understand our customers' use of our products. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including your IP address or cookies.

							<h4 id="protect_information">HOW DOES SUPER LAWYERS PROTECT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IT COLLECTS?</h4>
							<p>We have implemented certain appropriate security measures to help protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, some of our websites are protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.

In addition, we use intrusion detection and virus protection software. However, please note that we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will always be unable to defeat our security measures.</p>
							<p>Also, please note that we may store and process your personal information in systems located outside of your home country. However, regardless of where storage and processing may occur, we take appropriate steps to ensure that your information is protected, consistent with the principles set forth under this statement.</p>

							<br>


							<h4 id="who_has_access">WHO HAS ACCESS TO THE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h4>

								<li>As required by law; in a matter of public safety or policy; in connection with billing information for any purchases or other transactions made with a credit card, debit card, or similar instrument; as needed in connection with the transfer of our business assets (for example, if we are acquired by another company or if we are liquidated during bankruptcy proceedings); or if we believe in good faith that sharing the data is necessary to protect our rights or property. </li>
							</ul>
							<p>We also rely on some of our affiliates for support of the products and services we offer, and we share some of our back-office functions with other Thomson Reuters companies. We may disclose personally identifiable information from time to time to our affiliates to assist in our marketing efforts. Our affiliates are all required to preserve the confidentiality of any personal information they may access.</p>
							<p>We may share, rent or sell to third parties aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about visitors to the website, such as how many users clicked on a particular advertisement.
