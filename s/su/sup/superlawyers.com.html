You may not use the Web Site for any illegal purpose.  Any unauthorized use of the Web Site or its Content is prohibited.</li>
								<li><strong>Not Legal Advice; Use at Own Risk.</strong>  Content contained on or made available through the Web Site is not intended to and does not constitute legal advice or recommendations and no attorney-client relationship is formed.  Provider is not a law firm and the Web Site is not a lawyer referral service.  Provider does not receive any lawyer's or law firm's fees for legal services and any arrangements made between you and any lawyer or law firm are strictly between you and such party and do not involve Provider in any way.  The accuracy, completeness, adequacy or currency of the Content is not warranted or guaranteed.  Your use of information on the Web Site or materials linked from the Web Site is at your own risk.</li>
								<li><strong>Intellectual Property Rights.</strong>  Except as expressly provided in these Terms of Use, nothing contained herein shall be construed as conferring any license or right, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, under copyright or other intellectual property rights.  You acknowledge that the Content and Web Site are protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents or other proprietary rights and laws.  You acknowledge by using the Web Site that all Content is the property of provider and that provider owns all rights, including copyrights, in and to the Content.</li>
								<li><strong>No Solicitation.</strong>  You will not distribute on or through the Web Site or to any person or entity identified thought the Web Site any content or material containing commercial solicitations or advertising of any kind without the written consent of Provider.

								<li><strong>Advertisers.</strong>  This Web Site may contain advertising and sponsored Content.  Advertisers and sponsors are responsible for ensuring that material submitted for inclusion on the Web Site is accurate and complies with applicable laws.  Provider will not be responsible for the illegality of or any error or inaccuracy in advertisers' or sponsors' materials.</li>
								<li>
									<p><strong>Privacy Policy.</strong>  We are committed to protecting our relationship with our readers.  To do so, we have created this privacy policy.</p>
									<p>Provider collects aggregate information and personally identifiable information on visitors to the Web Site for use in the course of Provider's business activities, as provided herein.  We employ the use of cookies, or small files that our web server will store on your computer to give you an individual ID.  This will make it easier for you to use the Web Site during subsequent visits.  The use of cookies allows us to customize your experience in the future by enabling us to track how the Web Site is used.</p>
									
									<p>Users of the Web Site may provide personally identifiable information in connection with compiling profile information as part of the Super LawyersÂ® selection process.  Provider may also obtain personally identifiable information from third parties.  Provider may use personally identifiable information, whether provided by you or independently obtained by Provider, (i) in the course of the research, voting and selection process for Super Lawyers; (ii) to evaluate attorneys as part of the Super Lawyers selection process; and (iii) in connection with the sale of profiles, advertisements, plaques, certificates or other items or services.  The personally identifiable information may include e-mail addresses, work zip code, educational background, professional information, disciplinary actions, criminal history or other similar information, the access code and password used by you to access the Web Site, and individual profile information.  Provider will not trade, sell, or otherwise commercially disseminate any personal information, except (i) as part of its business activities or the business activities of an affiliate, including exchanging credit card information with credit card companies; (ii) as part of a professional profile published in connection with any Super Lawyers publication or listing; or (iii) in connection with the sale of all or a portion of Provider's business.  In addition, Provider may disclose personally identifiable information from time to time to its affiliates to assist in their marketing efforts.  For purposes of these Terms of Use, "affiliate" means any company that controls Provider ("Parent"), any company that is controlled by Provider ("Subsidiary"), companies used to maintain and update basic contact information, such as current law firm, address, etc., or any company that controls or is controlled by any such Parent or Subsidiary.  Provider may disclose personally identifiable information when the law requires such disclosure, in response to legal process and law enforcement requests, in connection with billing information for any purchases or other transactions made with a credit card, debit card, or similar instrument, and as necessary to protect the property, interests, and rights of Provider, its affiliates and others.</p>
									
									<p>At times we may contract with unaffiliated third parties to assist us in managing and maintaining our customer information or Web Site.  At no time will we authorize those parties to use your information for any other purpose.  Additionally, we may share, rent or sell to third parties aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about visitors to the Web Site, such as how many users clicked on a particular advertisement.  Such information does not identify individual users.  Except as set forth in this policy, at no time will we disseminate personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties.</p>
									<p>Provider will follow commercially acceptable practices to protect the confidentiality of Content in non-public, password protected portions of the Web Site.</p>
									<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request certain information regarding certain disclosure of personal information to third parties in certain circumstances for a business's direct marketing purposes. To make such a request if this section of the California Civil Code applies to you, please send an e-mail to:  <a href="/contact.html?address=Support">Webmaster</a>.</p>
