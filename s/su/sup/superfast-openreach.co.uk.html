            <p><strong>  </strong></p>
            <p></p><p><strong>BT Websites Privacy and Security Policy</strong></p>
<p>We have developed this policy because we want you to feel confident about the privacy and security of your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p>BT Group plc is the holding company for an integrated group of businesses that provides voice and data services in the UK and overseas. British Telecommunications plc is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BT Group plc and holds virtually all businesses and assets of the BT group. British Telecommunications plc has four lines of business (LOB) - BT Retail, BT Wholesale, BT Global Services and BT Exact. A fifth line of business, Openreach, opened for business on January 11, 2006.</p>
<p>BT Retail provides telephone lines to most people in the UK, as well as a wide range of communications products and services to the residential and business markets including mass market Internet access. BT Wholesale provides network services and solutions to communications companies. Openreach provides a portfolio of services related to the access and backhaul networks. BT Exact is BT's research, technology and IT operations business. It offers expertise and experience in information and communications technology (ICT).</p>
<p>When we refer to "we" or "our" or "BT" we are referring to BT Group plc (which includes British Telecommunications plc) and its subsidiaries, or any of them, as the context requires.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we have a Privacy Policy?</strong></p>
<p>We have developed this policy because we want you to feel confident about the privacy and security of your personal information. BT is registered under the data protection laws in the United Kingdom and takes all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised access to your personal information.</p>
<p>When we refer to "personal information" in this privacy policy, we mean information, which identifies you as an individual, or is capable of doing so. Accordingly, we may hold and use data about you in your capacity as a consumer, a business customer, as an individual acting on behalf of a business customer, as a shareholder, or in any other capacity, for example, when you visit our websites.</p>
<p>Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you are visiting any of our websites or using any of our services, by continuing to do so, you indicate your agreement to our use of your personal information as set out in this privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>What does this privacy policy cover?</strong></p>
<p>This privacy policy only applies to how BT deals with your personal information. It does not apply to any other company or to any other company's websites even if you access them through BT. If you disclose your personal information to other companies your information will be dealt with according to their privacy practices.<br><strong>What personal information do we collect about you, and when do we collect it?</strong></p>
<p>We may ask you for information to enable us to provide a service to you and we collect this information by telephone, written correspondence or via a website. We may ask you for information including your name, private/business address, contact telephone numbers and email address. We may also ask you for other information that relates to the service you are using or ordering. For example, we may need your credit card number to charge you for certain services.</p>
<p>When you (or someone using your telephone line) make a telephone call or send a fax that uses our telephone network or connect to the world wide web, we keep a record of that call (including the number called) to enable BT to charge for it. We also receive from other operators information about calls made over our network, where we need that information for connecting and billing purposes.</p>
<p>If someone abuses or damages the telephone network, for example by making offensive or nuisance calls, we may keep information relating to that abuse.</p>
<p><br>
We have information about your use of our services (such as the amount of time you spend on-line), which we use to manage our network, and for billing. We may also use this information for marketing products and services but we will give the option to opt out of receiving this material.<br>
If you enter into any of our competitions or promotions, we may ask for information about you, which will be made clear at the time you enter. We will also inform you of the purposes for which the information you provide may be used.</p>
<p>We may ask you from time to time about what use you make of the services we provide, what other services you would like us to provide in the future, and for other information, such as lifestyle data.</p>
<p>We collect information from visitors to our websites to help us to make improvements to the websites and to the services we make available. We know, for instance, how many visitors there are to each website, when they visited, for how long and to which areas of our website they went.</p>
<p>We may share this information with our advertisers and to other companies which offer their goods or services on our websites. It helps to show these organisations how effective our websites are as sales channels for their products. You or any other individual cannot be identified from the information we share as the data is aggregated and anonymous.<br>
We do not use this information to:</p>
<ol>
<li>identify individuals visiting our website; or</li>
<li>analyse your visits to any other websites (except that we do track you if you go to websites carrying our banner, but we do not identify personal details while we do this); or</li>

<p>We may change our privacy policy from time to time. New policies will be published on our web sites.</p>
<p><strong>Does BT's privacy policy protect me when I use BT's websites?</strong></p>
<p>BT's privacy policy also applies to information collected when you use any of our websites.<br>
You do not have to register to access most of our websites. However, if you provide information via the "contact us" or any of the other interactive features, you indicate your consent to our use of your personal data in the manner described in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>If you do register on one of our websites, we may ask you to provide personal details such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and, where appropriate, BT account number. We also ask you to choose a password, and to complete a password security question and answer, in case you forget your password for any reason.</p>
<p>Once you have registered on one of our websites, we may keep a record of your use of any of the services made available via that particular website. (Please see "When does BT use cookies" below for more information on how we do this).</p>
<p>If you choose not to register with us and only browse our websites, we may gather information to help make your visit to our website more satisfying.

<p>If you do not wish to register, you will still be able to use and order some of the services offered via our websites. We will only ask you to provide such information as necessary to enable us to carry out the transaction in question. We will not use that information for any other purpose.
