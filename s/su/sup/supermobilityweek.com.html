As part of this reform, the FCC would also update historic reviews for other wireless deployments and adopt a shot clock for the agency’s own environmental review procedures.\r\n\r\nThis approach, up for a vote at the FCC’s March 22 open meeting, will more effectively target and streamline reviews that were designed with large cell towers in mind.\r\n\r\nBut wireless networks and infrastructure have evolved over the past two decades. New antennas the size of pizza boxes, called small cells, are key to supporting 5G.\r\n\r\nHowever, too many rules remain designed for 200-foot towers—not today’s small cells.\r\n\r\nCommissioner Carr’s proposed reform is critical for three reasons.\r\n\r\nOne, Americans are using more mobile data. Two, more wireless infrastructure is necessary to meet that demand and enable smart communities and the Internet of Things. Three—and perhaps most importantly—the U.S. is in a global race to build the next generation of networks, 5G.\r\n\r\nBeing first with the next generation of wireless is essential to maintaining our lead in the broader wireless ecosystem. And 5G leadership will help keep the next generation of developers—whether for apps, operating systems, augmented and virtual reality, or artificial intelligence—focused on the U.S.\r\n\r\nToday, however, installing modern wireless infrastructure requires multiple, often duplicative reviews. That’s because the FCC has historically applied NHPA and NEPA to many wireless deployments.\r\n\r\nThe time has come for a change. That’s why we support Commissioner Carr’s proposal.\r\n\r\nReviews required under decades-old interpretations hinder wireless deployments with excessive and increasing costs and unnecessary delays—a dynamic especially true in rural areas with challenging business cases.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a single wireless provider projects NHPA\u002FNEPA compliance costs totaling $45 million this year alone. That’s wireless industry investment dollars that could be going directly to more network improvements.\r\n\r\nEliminating unnecessary reviews will mean tremendous time and cost savings that will spur job creation and boost network investment, without impacting the environment or historic properties as these federal reviews will continue to happen when appropriate. And accelerating 5G deployment timelines will add billions to the U.S. economy.\r\n\r\nThis reform builds on the FCC’s earlier bipartisan efforts to modernize historic preservation policies and its current efforts to ensure that America is 5G ready. The FCC has already recognized that small cells have little or no impact on environmentally sensitive or historic sites.\r\n\r\nIf the agency follows through, America’s economy and consumers will win—and the U.S. will be well positioned to win the race to 5G.\r\n\r\nThe wireless industry is ready to invest $275 billion to deploy 5G, according to Accenture. 5G will create 3 million new jobs nationwide and generate $500 billion for America’s economy.\r\n\r\nFor small cells, that’s a pretty big impact.","post_title":"A Welcome FCC Proposal to Jumpstart Wireless Investment","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"a-welcome-fcc-proposal-to-jumpstart-wireless-investment","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-04-20 20:26:47","post_modified_gmt":"2018-04-20 20:26:47","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\u002F\u002F61444A96-64C4-67A6-BC70-FF0000ED09A9","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":13109,"post_author":"19","post_date":"2018-03-22 18:44:41","post_date_gmt":"2018-03-22 18:44:41","post_content":"&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"FCC Infrastructure Reform Jumpstarts 5G Deployment","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"fcc-infrastructure-reform-jumpstarts-5g-deployment","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-05-02 20:49:05","post_modified_gmt":"2018-05-02 20:49:05","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.ctia.org\u002F?p=13109","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"learn_more","heading":"Infrastructure Channel","copy":"Everything you need to know about wireless infrastructure in one place.","button":"Learn More","link":"\u002Fhomepage\u002Finfrastructure-channel"}],"meta_title":"","meta_keywords":"","meta_description":""},"slug":"ctia-commends-chairman-pai-fcc-for-acting-to-streamline-next-generation-wireless-deployments","excerpt":"","seo":{"description":"","keyword":"","canonical":"","noFollow":false,"noIndex":false,"opengraph":{"title":"","description":"","image":""},"twitter":{"title":"","description":"","image":""}}},{"id":14945,"title":"FCC Action on High-Band Spectrum Will Help U.S. Win the Global 5G Race","content":"","date":"2018-08-02 15:04:36","categories":[{"term_id":10,"name":"Press Release","slug":"press-release","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":10,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":153,"filter":"raw","cat_ID":10,"category_count":153,"category_description":"","cat_name":"Press Release","category_nicename":"press-release","category_parent":0},{"term_id":12,"name":"Statement","slug":"statement","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":12,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":201,"filter":"raw","cat_ID":12,"category_count":201,"category_description":"","cat_name":"Statement","category_nicename":"statement","category_parent":0}],"primaryCategory":10,"type":"post","tags":[{"term_id":17,"name":"5G","slug":"5g","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":17,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":257,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":20,"name":"Spectrum","slug":"spectrum","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":20,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":287,"filter":"raw"}],"fields":{"header":{"copy":"","hero_image":false,"hero_image_treatment":"cover","members_only":false},"premium_image":false,"components":[{"acf_fc_layout":"intro","text":"\u003Cp\u003EWASHINGTON – The following statement is for attribution to \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ctia.org\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ECTIA®\u003C\u002Fa\u003E Senior Vice President for Regulatory Affairs, Scott Bergmann.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"\u003Cp\u003E“Today’s forward-looking action by Chairman Pai and the FCC will help the United States win the global 5G race.

Summary\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EThe wireless industry has baked security into our networks since the beginning, and works diligently to continually update and build on our security capabilities with every generation of wireless. Today’s 4G LTE networks have the most advanced security features to date, and 5G will further improve upon them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs 5G networks start to be deployed this year, wireless providers are leveraging new and advanced measures—after years of research, investment, and contributions to standards bodies—to secure 5G networks. This paper updates CTIA’s 2017 Protecting America’s Wireless Networks paper to feature 5G security highlights, including:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnhanced privacy protections\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n5G networks offer enhanced privacy protections like the encryption of each device’s IMSI, or unique user identifier. Industry is implementing this update to further secure device-specific and consumer-specific information as it moves on a 5G wireless network.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe ability to leverage 5G “home” wireless network security when roaming or on Wi-Fi\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nWireless providers are extending the security of 5G wireless networks to other networks—called home network control—when a user is roaming or using a non-wireless network like Wi-Fi. This use of home network security on all networks more thoroughly protects devices, consumer data, and even the network itself at all times.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDevice-specific security updates\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nWireless providers developed systems that will allow consumers to receive new and advanced security technology updates meant for their device type—referred to as providing native support for plug-in security. Previous generations of wireless networks were only able to support a one-size-fits-all approach.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFurther enhancing security across the wireless ecosystem, wireless providers are increasingly deploying network components that are virtual instead of the hardware of years’ past. 5G’s virtual and cloud-based network systems allow for more adaptable security since they can be quickly adjusted, removed, or replaced using software, reducing the likelihood that an entire network would be impacted by a cyber attack.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStrong cybersecurity is key to the U.S.’s global wireless leadership. 5G is going to be up to 100 times faster, five times more responsive, and able to support 100 times more devices,\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003Eunlocking innovations we can’t even imagine.

As part of this reform, the FCC would also update historic reviews for other wireless deployments and adopt a shot clock for the agency’s own environmental review procedures.\r\n\r\nThis approach, up for a vote at the FCC’s March 22 open meeting, will more effectively target and streamline reviews that were designed with large cell towers in mind.\r\n\r\nBut wireless networks and infrastructure have evolved over the past two decades. New antennas the size of pizza boxes, called small cells, are key to supporting 5G.\r\n\r\nHowever, too many rules remain designed for 200-foot towers—not today’s small cells.\r\n\r\nCommissioner Carr’s proposed reform is critical for three reasons.\r\n\r\nOne, Americans are using more mobile data. Two, more wireless infrastructure is necessary to meet that demand and enable smart communities and the Internet of Things. Three—and perhaps most importantly—the U.S. is in a global race to build the next generation of networks, 5G.\r\n\r\nBeing first with the next generation of wireless is essential to maintaining our lead in the broader wireless ecosystem. And 5G leadership will help keep the next generation of developers—whether for apps, operating systems, augmented and virtual reality, or artificial intelligence—focused on the U.S.\r\n\r\nToday, however, installing modern wireless infrastructure requires multiple, often duplicative reviews. That’s because the FCC has historically applied NHPA and NEPA to many wireless deployments.\r\n\r\nThe time has come for a change. That’s why we support Commissioner Carr’s proposal.\r\n\r\nReviews required under decades-old interpretations hinder wireless deployments with excessive and increasing costs and unnecessary delays—a dynamic especially true in rural areas with challenging business cases.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a single wireless provider projects NHPA\u002FNEPA compliance costs totaling $45 million this year alone. That’s wireless industry investment dollars that could be going directly to more network improvements.\r\n\r\nEliminating unnecessary reviews will mean tremendous time and cost savings that will spur job creation and boost network investment, without impacting the environment or historic properties as these federal reviews will continue to happen when appropriate. And accelerating 5G deployment timelines will add billions to the U.S. economy.\r\n\r\nThis reform builds on the FCC’s earlier bipartisan efforts to modernize historic preservation policies and its current efforts to ensure that America is 5G ready. The FCC has already recognized that small cells have little or no impact on environmentally sensitive or historic sites.\r\n\r\nIf the agency follows through, America’s economy and consumers will win—and the U.S. will be well positioned to win the race to 5G.\r\n\r\nThe wireless industry is ready to invest $275 billion to deploy 5G, according to Accenture. 5G will create 3 million new jobs nationwide and generate $500 billion for America’s economy.\r\n\r\nFor small cells, that’s a pretty big impact.","post_title":"A Welcome FCC Proposal to Jumpstart Wireless Investment","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"a-welcome-fcc-proposal-to-jumpstart-wireless-investment","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-04-20 20:26:47","post_modified_gmt":"2018-04-20 20:26:47","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\u002F\u002F61444A96-64C4-67A6-BC70-FF0000ED09A9","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":13109,"post_author":"19","post_date":"2018-03-22 18:44:41","post_date_gmt":"2018-03-22 18:44:41","post_content":"&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"FCC Infrastructure Reform Jumpstarts 5G Deployment","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"fcc-infrastructure-reform-jumpstarts-5g-deployment","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-05-02 20:49:05","post_modified_gmt":"2018-05-02 20:49:05","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.ctia.org\u002F?p=13109","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"learn_more","heading":"Infrastructure Channel","copy":"Everything you need to know about wireless infrastructure in one place.","button":"Learn More","link":"\u002Fhomepage\u002Finfrastructure-channel"}],"meta_title":"","meta_keywords":"","meta_description":""},"slug":"ctia-commends-chairman-pai-fcc-for-acting-to-streamline-next-generation-wireless-deployments","excerpt":"","seo":{"description":"","keyword":"","canonical":"","noFollow":false,"noIndex":false,"opengraph":{"title":"","description":"","image":""},"twitter":{"title":"","description":"","image":""}}},{"id":14945,"title":"FCC Action on High-Band Spectrum Will Help U.S. Win the Global 5G Race","content":"","date":"2018-08-02 15:04:36","categories":[{"term_id":10,"name":"Press Release","slug":"press-release","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":10,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":153,"filter":"raw","cat_ID":10,"category_count":153,"category_description":"","cat_name":"Press Release","category_nicename":"press-release","category_parent":0},{"term_id":12,"name":"Statement","slug":"statement","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":12,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":201,"filter":"raw","cat_ID":12,"category_count":201,"category_description":"","cat_name":"Statement","category_nicename":"statement","category_parent":0}],"primaryCategory":10,"type":"post","tags":[{"term_id":17,"name":"5G","slug":"5g","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":17,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":257,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":20,"name":"Spectrum","slug":"spectrum","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":20,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":287,"filter":"raw"}],"fields":{"header":{"copy":"","hero_image":false,"hero_image_treatment":"cover","members_only":false},"premium_image":false,"components":[{"acf_fc_layout":"intro","text":"\u003Cp\u003EWASHINGTON – The following statement is for attribution to \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ctia.org\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ECTIA®\u003C\u002Fa\u003E Senior Vice President for Regulatory Affairs, Scott Bergmann.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"\u003Cp\u003E“Today’s forward-looking action by Chairman Pai and the FCC will help the United States win the global 5G race.

Summary\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EThe wireless industry has baked security into our networks since the beginning, and works diligently to continually update and build on our security capabilities with every generation of wireless. Today’s 4G LTE networks have the most advanced security features to date, and 5G will further improve upon them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs 5G networks start to be deployed this year, wireless providers are leveraging new and advanced measures—after years of research, investment, and contributions to standards bodies—to secure 5G networks. This paper updates CTIA’s 2017 Protecting America’s Wireless Networks paper to feature 5G security highlights, including:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnhanced privacy protections\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n5G networks offer enhanced privacy protections like the encryption of each device’s IMSI, or unique user identifier. Industry is implementing this update to further secure device-specific and consumer-specific information as it moves on a 5G wireless network.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe ability to leverage 5G “home” wireless network security when roaming or on Wi-Fi\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nWireless providers are extending the security of 5G wireless networks to other networks—called home network control—when a user is roaming or using a non-wireless network like Wi-Fi. This use of home network security on all networks more thoroughly protects devices, consumer data, and even the network itself at all times.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDevice-specific security updates\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nWireless providers developed systems that will allow consumers to receive new and advanced security technology updates meant for their device type—referred to as providing native support for plug-in security. Previous generations of wireless networks were only able to support a one-size-fits-all approach.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFurther enhancing security across the wireless ecosystem, wireless providers are increasingly deploying network components that are virtual instead of the hardware of years’ past. 5G’s virtual and cloud-based network systems allow for more adaptable security since they can be quickly adjusted, removed, or replaced using software, reducing the likelihood that an entire network would be impacted by a cyber attack.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStrong cybersecurity is key to the U.S.’s global wireless leadership. 5G is going to be up to 100 times faster, five times more responsive, and able to support 100 times more devices,\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003Eunlocking innovations we can’t even imagine.

As part of this reform, the FCC would also update historic reviews for other wireless deployments and adopt a shot clock for the agency’s own environmental review procedures.\r\n\r\nThis approach, up for a vote at the FCC’s March 22 open meeting, will more effectively target and streamline reviews that were designed with large cell towers in mind.\r\n\r\nBut wireless networks and infrastructure have evolved over the past two decades. New antennas the size of pizza boxes, called small cells, are key to supporting 5G.\r\n\r\nHowever, too many rules remain designed for 200-foot towers—not today’s small cells.\r\n\r\nCommissioner Carr’s proposed reform is critical for three reasons.\r\n\r\nOne, Americans are using more mobile data. Two, more wireless infrastructure is necessary to meet that demand and enable smart communities and the Internet of Things. Three—and perhaps most importantly—the U.S. is in a global race to build the next generation of networks, 5G.\r\n\r\nBeing first with the next generation of wireless is essential to maintaining our lead in the broader wireless ecosystem. And 5G leadership will help keep the next generation of developers—whether for apps, operating systems, augmented and virtual reality, or artificial intelligence—focused on the U.S.\r\n\r\nToday, however, installing modern wireless infrastructure requires multiple, often duplicative reviews. That’s because the FCC has historically applied NHPA and NEPA to many wireless deployments.\r\n\r\nThe time has come for a change. That’s why we support Commissioner Carr’s proposal.\r\n\r\nReviews required under decades-old interpretations hinder wireless deployments with excessive and increasing costs and unnecessary delays—a dynamic especially true in rural areas with challenging business cases.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a single wireless provider projects NHPA\u002FNEPA compliance costs totaling $45 million this year alone. That’s wireless industry investment dollars that could be going directly to more network improvements.\r\n\r\nEliminating unnecessary reviews will mean tremendous time and cost savings that will spur job creation and boost network investment, without impacting the environment or historic properties as these federal reviews will continue to happen when appropriate. And accelerating 5G deployment timelines will add billions to the U.S. economy.\r\n\r\nThis reform builds on the FCC’s earlier bipartisan efforts to modernize historic preservation policies and its current efforts to ensure that America is 5G ready. The FCC has already recognized that small cells have little or no impact on environmentally sensitive or historic sites.\r\n\r\nIf the agency follows through, America’s economy and consumers will win—and the U.S. will be well positioned to win the race to 5G.\r\n\r\nThe wireless industry is ready to invest $275 billion to deploy 5G, according to Accenture. 5G will create 3 million new jobs nationwide and generate $500 billion for America’s economy.\r\n\r\nFor small cells, that’s a pretty big impact.","post_title":"A Welcome FCC Proposal to Jumpstart Wireless Investment","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"a-welcome-fcc-proposal-to-jumpstart-wireless-investment","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-04-20 20:26:47","post_modified_gmt":"2018-04-20 20:26:47","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\u002F\u002F61444A96-64C4-67A6-BC70-FF0000ED09A9","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":13109,"post_author":"19","post_date":"2018-03-22 18:44:41","post_date_gmt":"2018-03-22 18:44:41","post_content":"&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"FCC Infrastructure Reform Jumpstarts 5G Deployment","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"fcc-infrastructure-reform-jumpstarts-5g-deployment","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-05-02 20:49:05","post_modified_gmt":"2018-05-02 20:49:05","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.ctia.org\u002F?p=13109","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"learn_more","heading":"Infrastructure Channel","copy":"Everything you need to know about wireless infrastructure in one place.","button":"Learn More","link":"\u002Fhomepage\u002Finfrastructure-channel"}],"meta_title":"","meta_keywords":"","meta_description":""},"slug":"ctia-commends-chairman-pai-fcc-for-acting-to-streamline-next-generation-wireless-deployments","excerpt":"","seo":{"description":"","keyword":"","canonical":"","noFollow":false,"noIndex":false,"opengraph":{"title":"","description":"","image":""},"twitter":{"title":"","description":"","image":""}}},{"id":14945,"title":"FCC Action on High-Band Spectrum Will Help U.S. Win the Global 5G Race","content":"","date":"2018-08-02 15:04:36","categories":[{"term_id":10,"name":"Press Release","slug":"press-release","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":10,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":153,"filter":"raw","cat_ID":10,"category_count":153,"category_description":"","cat_name":"Press Release","category_nicename":"press-release","category_parent":0},{"term_id":12,"name":"Statement","slug":"statement","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":12,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":201,"filter":"raw","cat_ID":12,"category_count":201,"category_description":"","cat_name":"Statement","category_nicename":"statement","category_parent":0}],"primaryCategory":10,"type":"post","tags":[{"term_id":17,"name":"5G","slug":"5g","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":17,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":257,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":20,"name":"Spectrum","slug":"spectrum","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":20,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":287,"filter":"raw"}],"fields":{"header":{"copy":"","hero_image":false,"hero_image_treatment":"cover","members_only":false},"premium_image":false,"components":[{"acf_fc_layout":"intro","text":"\u003Cp\u003EWASHINGTON – The following statement is for attribution to \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ctia.org\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ECTIA®\u003C\u002Fa\u003E Senior Vice President for Regulatory Affairs, Scott Bergmann.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"\u003Cp\u003E“Today’s forward-looking action by Chairman Pai and the FCC will help the United States win the global 5G race.

Summary\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EThe wireless industry has baked security into our networks since the beginning, and works diligently to continually update and build on our security capabilities with every generation of wireless. Today’s 4G LTE networks have the most advanced security features to date, and 5G will further improve upon them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs 5G networks start to be deployed this year, wireless providers are leveraging new and advanced measures—after years of research, investment, and contributions to standards bodies—to secure 5G networks. This paper updates CTIA’s 2017 Protecting America’s Wireless Networks paper to feature 5G security highlights, including:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnhanced privacy protections\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n5G networks offer enhanced privacy protections like the encryption of each device’s IMSI, or unique user identifier. Industry is implementing this update to further secure device-specific and consumer-specific information as it moves on a 5G wireless network.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe ability to leverage 5G “home” wireless network security when roaming or on Wi-Fi\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nWireless providers are extending the security of 5G wireless networks to other networks—called home network control—when a user is roaming or using a non-wireless network like Wi-Fi. This use of home network security on all networks more thoroughly protects devices, consumer data, and even the network itself at all times.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDevice-specific security updates\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nWireless providers developed systems that will allow consumers to receive new and advanced security technology updates meant for their device type—referred to as providing native support for plug-in security. Previous generations of wireless networks were only able to support a one-size-fits-all approach.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFurther enhancing security across the wireless ecosystem, wireless providers are increasingly deploying network components that are virtual instead of the hardware of years’ past. 5G’s virtual and cloud-based network systems allow for more adaptable security since they can be quickly adjusted, removed, or replaced using software, reducing the likelihood that an entire network would be impacted by a cyber attack.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStrong cybersecurity is key to the U.S.’s global wireless leadership. 5G is going to be up to 100 times faster, five times more responsive, and able to support 100 times more devices,\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003Eunlocking innovations we can’t even imagine.

Congress is right to explore how to foster this innovative new technology – and to focus now on the needs of tomorrow’s wireless networks.\r\n\r\nAmerica leads the world in wireless today, but countries like China, Germany, and Japan are challenging our wireless leadership in the race to deploy 5G.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. wireless industry knows that leading the world in 5G matters – and according to results from a recent CTIA-commissioned \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ctia.org\u002Findustry-data\u002Fpress-releases-details\u002Fpress-releases\u002Findustry-leaders-believe-u.s.-must-be-a-global-leader-in-5g-wireless-for-their-business-to-stay-competitive\"\u003Esurvey\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, so do key business leaders across our economy.\r\n\r\nThe survey found that nearly 7 out of 10 industry executives, from healthcare and energy to transportation and manufacturing, think the U.S. needs to be a global leader in 5G for their business to remain competitive.\r\n\r\nNext-generation 5G networks will be up to 100 times faster, support 100 times more devices, and respond 5 times more quickly, providing a level of wireless connectivity that will unleash the full spirit of American entrepreneurship and innovation.\r\n\r\nDon’t just take my word on the benefits of 5G – let’s hear from these industry leaders.\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EWhen it comes to routine care, 84 percent of executives in the healthcare industry believe that 5G will help generate better patient outcomes.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EThree out of four energy leaders believe that wireless-powered smart grids will reduce energy consumption and help consumers and businesses save money.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EIn transportation, 79 percent of executives in the industry believe that 5G will improve roadway safety, reduce traffic accidents, and save lives.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EAs U.S. manufacturing makes a comeback, 73 percent of that sector’s leaders believe wireless technologies like 5G will make their business more competitive.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\r\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\r\nThese executives know America’s 5G wireless leadership is crucial to their success, and that’s why the survey results come at a critical time.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Communications Commission also voted today to make available additional high-band spectrum for wireless use as well as to take its first steps in modernizing wireless infrastructure regulations.\r\n\r\nAnd in today’s hearing, members of Congress – building off of the newly formed 5G Caucus’s inaugural meeting last month – discussed how 5G will create jobs, transform industries, and grow our economy.\r\n\r\nTo unlock those 5G benefits, policymakers must focus on three key issues.\r\n\r\nFirst, building a spectrum pipeline to meet consumer demand for mobile data and the growing needs of 5G wireless networks. The process of bringing spectrum to market takes years – so we need to act now.\r\n\r\nSecond, creating modern rules for modern wireless networks. Too many infrastructure regulations at the federal, state, and local levels are designed for 200-foot tall cell towers – not the small cells, often the size of pizza boxes, that will power 5G.\r\n\r\nThird, reforming and simplifying our corporate tax code. Accenture projects that the wireless industry is ready to invest $275 billion to deploy 5G so let’s incentivize and speed up that capital investment, which will create over 3 million American jobs and add $500 billion to our GDP.\r\n\r\nAmerica’s economy runs on wireless. Continuing our country’s wireless leadership in 5G will help keep U.S. businesses competitive in the 21\u003Csup\u003Est\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E century global economy.\r\n\r\n\u003Cem\u003EKelly Cole is the SVP for Government Affairs for CTIA, the trade association that represents the U.S. wireless communications industry and companies throughout the mobile ecosystem.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Business Leaders Know that America’s 5G Wireless Leadership Matters","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"business-leaders-know-that-america-s-5g-wireless-leadership-matters","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-07-23 19:21:11","post_modified_gmt":"2018-07-23 19:21:11","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\u002F\u002F63A94996-64C4-67A6-BC70-FF0000ED09A9","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"}]}],"meta_title":"","meta_keywords":"","meta_description":""},"slug":"a-5g-device-a-day-the-positive-impact-of-wireless-on-healthcare","excerpt":"","seo":{"description":"","keyword":"","canonical":"","noFollow":false,"noIndex":false,"opengraph":{"title":"","description":"","image":""},"twitter":{"title":"","description":"","image":""}}},{"id":14541,"title":"Work Out, Wirelessly","content":"","date":"2018-06-21 14:53:19","categories":[{"term_id":8,"name":"Blog","slug":"blog","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":8,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":260,"filter":"raw","cat_ID":8,"category_count":260,"category_description":"","cat_name":"Blog","category_nicename":"blog","category_parent":0}],"primaryCategory":8,"type":"post","tags":[{"term_id":35,"name":"Wireless Industry","slug":"wireless-industry","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":35,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":136,"filter":"raw"}],"fields":{"header":{"copy":"","hero_image":false,"hero_image_treatment":"cover","members_only":false},"premium_image":false,"author":{"team_member":false,"name":"Chelsea Sellers","title":"","image":false,"has_second_author":false,"second_author":false,"second_author_name":"","second_author_title":"","second_author_image":false},"caption":"","youtube_id":"","image":false,"components":[{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"\u003Cp\u003EWhether you prefer yoga, running or weight training, exercise is an inherently mobile activity.

The findings show China, South Korea, the United States and Japan as the lead competitors in that order. China’s narrow lead is due to a combination of both proactive government policies and industry momentum. The study attributes the United States’ high ranking to the fact that America’s wireless industry is a global leader in preparing to deploy 5G commercially, with significant investments in these next-generation networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“The United States will not get a second chance to win the global 5G race,” said Meredith Attwell Baker, CTIA President and CEO. “I’m confident that America can win and reap the significant economic benefits of 5G wireless due to our world-leading commercial investments. Today’s research highlights the importance of policymaker action in 2018 to reform local zoning rules and unlock access to mid-band spectrum as part of a broader spectrum pipeline plan. I’m optimistic we will leapfrog China because key leaders in the Administration, on Capitol Hill, and at the FCC are focused on the reforms needed to win the race.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn evaluating the current status of the global race to 5G, Analysys Mason studied 5G spectrum and infrastructure policies as well the commercial industry plans of ten countries.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKey findings by Analysys Mason include:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAll major Chinese providers have committed to specific launch dates and the government has committed to at least 100 MHz of mid-band spectrum and 2,000 MHz of high-band spectrum for each wireless provider.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECountries around the world are moving quickly to make spectrum available for 5G.
