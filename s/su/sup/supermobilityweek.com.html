<h2><a name="introduction"></a>I. Introduction</h2>
<p>CTIA   is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information.&nbsp; This Privacy Statement provides information   explaining how we collect, use, and share information from our Super Mobility   Week website, as well as the choices you have regarding our use of this   information.&nbsp;Please note that some of CTIA's departments and   subsidiaries have their own websites dedicated to specific advocacy   initiatives, and those websites may be governed by separate privacy policies   and procedures. We encourage you to read this entire Privacy Statement   before using or submitting information to this website.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>
<p>This Privacy Statement only   addresses the collection, use, and disclosure of your information through the   Super Mobility Week website.&nbsp; The Super   Mobility Week website contains links to other websites with different privacy   practices and policies.&nbsp; If you choose to   click on a link and visit another website, please be aware that your   information will be governed by that website’s privacy policy.&nbsp; For example, our website includes social   media Features such as Facebook Share and other   widgets.&nbsp; These Features are governed by   the privacy policy of the company providing the Feature or widget.&nbsp; We encourage you to carefully read and review   the policies and practices of the websites you visit.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>We understand that Privacy   Statements can often contain confusing terminology.&nbsp; To help you better understand our privacy   practices, here is what we mean when we say:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
    Cookies are small   text files created by a web server that are delivered through a web browser and   stored on your computer or device.&nbsp; Cookies are used to identify your computer or device and record your   preferences and other data so that the website can personalize your   visit(s).&nbsp; There are several types of   cookies.&nbsp; For example, the Super Mobility   Week website has its own cookies, called "first-party cookies," that makes our   website run smoother by doing things like keeping track of items in your   shopping cart.&nbsp; The Super Mobility Week   website also provides space for “third-party cookies” that are placed on your   browser by third party companies and may be used to remember parts of your   online activities in order to deliver personalized ads or analyze web   traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Personally Identifiable   Information</strong><br>
    Information that directly identifies or reasonably can be used   to figure out the identity of a user, such as your name, address,   phone number, and email address.&nbsp; Personal information does not include information that has been made   anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user.</li>
    <li><strong>Web Beacons</strong><br>
    A small,   transparent graphic image (also known as a tracking pixel) located on a web page   or HTML email that is often used with a cookie.&nbsp; Web beacons are generally invisible because they are very small and the   same color as the background of the Web page or email message.</li>
    <li><strong>Encryption</strong><br>
    The process of encoding messages or   information in such a way that unauthorized parties cannot read it.</li>
    <li><strong>Secure Socket Layer ("SSL")</strong><br>
    SSL   technology allows for the encryption of information as it leaves your computer,   making it nearly impossible for anyone other than the intended recipient to   decrypt it.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="how-your-information-is-collected"></a>II. How Your Information is   Collected</h2>
<p>CTIA   may collect information about you in two ways through our Super Mobility   Website: 1) information that you   voluntarily provide to us; and 2) information that we collect automatically   when you visit or interact with our website.</p>
<h3>Information You Voluntarily Provide</h3>
<p>CTIA   only collects personally identifiable information through our Super Mobility   Week website when you provide it to us for purposes such as show registration, contest   submissions, and requests for further information on events, products, or   services.&nbsp; You may provide different   pieces of personally identifiable information depending upon whether you choose   to register as a show attendee, speaker, sponsor, or exhibitor.&nbsp; The following are some of the ways in which   you may provide us with personally identifiable information while interacting   with our website:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you choose to attend one of CTIA's events you   may be asked to provide information on the registration pages of our website   including your name, address, email address, phone number, facsimile number,   payment information, and information about your interests in specific services   or events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>If   you reside outside the United States and are interested in attending one of our   events, you may choose to use one of our web-generated Invitation   Letter Request Form and provide information including your first and   last names, passport number, birth date, job title, company name, address,   country, zip code, and email.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>If you correspond with us via email, we may     retain such correspondence and the information contained in it in order to respond to your inquiry and notify you of future events, products, or services that we think may be of interest. You can learn more about your choices regarding these notifications below.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
<p>CTIA automatically collects information about your device and your visit to our Super Mobility Week website   from your computer's web browser. For example, we may automatically collect information such as the type of browser   you are using, the last website you visited before accessing our website, the   different areas of our website that you visit, and the date and time you   accessed our website. Our Super Mobility   Week website uses technologies, including cookies and web beacons, to collect   this type of information.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong><br>
    Cookies, web beacons, and other technologies collect information about you when you interact with the Super   Mobility Week website or show emails. Cookies and web beacons provide us with   information that allows us to develop more personalized content, to better   operate the website and enhance your experience, to recall your authentication   information for certain portions of the website, to tailor our communications   to you, to create features such as "Frequently Asked Questions" and to track   statistical information related to navigation throughout the website.<br>
    <br>
    We also use a third party analytics   service that uses its own cookies and web beacons to help analyze where   visitors go and what they do while visiting the website.&nbsp; The information collected by the analytics   provider cannot be used to identify you or reasonably used to identify you, and   is collected for the purpose of evaluating and compiling reports on website   activity.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    None of the information that CTIA   collects from cookies and web beacons is combined with any of the personally   identifiable information that you may provide to us while on our website.&nbsp; Please   note that most web browsers allow you to turn off cookies on your computer by   adjusting the web browser's settings. If you choose to turn off certain cookies,   your ability to use some areas or functions of the site may be limited. You can   learn more about managing your cookies in Section on Consumer Control and   Choices.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="how-your-personally-identifiable-information"></a>III. How Your Personally Identifiable Information is Used and Shared</h2>
<p>CTIA   uses the personally identifiable information that you provide on our Super   Mobility Week website for internal purposes such as responding to your requests   for information, communicating with you, conducting internal analyses, and   processing and completing orders and event registrations.&nbsp; We also use this information to communicate   with you about future events as well as products and services that we think may   interest you.</p>
<p>CTIA may disclose your personally   identifiable information in the following contexts:</p>
<h3>Consent</h3>
<p>CTIA may disclose your personal   information to third parties with your consent.&nbsp; Your consent may be implied, in writing, or we may obtain it online   through “click-through” agreements.&nbsp; For   example, when you register for a specific event at a CTIA show that is hosted   by one of our show partners, CTIA will share your contact information with our   partner that is hosting the event.&nbsp; By   registering for the partner hosted event, you have implicitly consented to the   sharing of your contact information.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Service   Providers</h3>
<p>CTIA may share your personally   identifiable information with other companies that perform services on our   behalf (for example, companies that manage, maintain, and perform analytics on   our mailing distribution lists).&nbsp; These   service providers are permitted to use the information only for the purpose   provided to them and in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy   Statement.&nbsp; We require our service   providers to comply with industry standards around security, retention, and use   of any personal information that we provide to them or that they collect on our   behalf.</p>
<h3>Legal   Purposes</h3>
<p>CTIA may access, monitor, use, or   disclose your personally identifiable Information or communications with us to   comply with the law (for example, to comply with a search warrant, subpoena, or   court order); to respond to emergencies; to enforce an agreement with you; to   protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of our agents,   vendors, service providers, members, and customers; or in the case of a   corporate sale, merger, dissolution, or acquisition.</p>
<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>
<p>CTIA may provide or rent lists   containing your name, company, title, address, and/or email address to third   parties and our partners, sponsors, exhibitors, for their direct and indirect   marketing purposes, unless you indicate that you do not want this information   used or shared for promotional or marketing purposes.&nbsp; When we provide mailing lists to third   parties, we ensure that our contracts with such parties require their   compliance with all applicable laws and limit their use of the list to a   limited number of mailings or postal communications.&nbsp; &nbsp;CTIA   will not share the personally identifiable information of our website visitors   and registered show attendees to third parties for direct marketing purposes   when individuals have exercised their option to prevent that information from   being disclosed to third parties for such purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;You can learn more about managing your communications with CTIA in the Section titled <a href="#consumer-control-and-choices">Consumer Control and Choices</a> below.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>The security of your information is important to CTIA.&nbsp; Therefore, CTIA uses generally accepted industry standards to protect the security and confidentiality of your information while under our control.&nbsp; We maintain physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect against the loss, misuse, and unauthorized access of your information. For instance, we limit access to your information to only those employees who need to know that information to provide benefits or services to you. In addition, when you provide sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) to purchase products or services, we take enhanced security precautions by using encryption technologies like SSL technology. Please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and that email is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information.</p>
<h3>Retention</h3>
<p>CTIA retains   personally identifiable information only as long as necessary for business or   tax purposes or as applicable laws, regulations, or government orders require.   When we dispose of collected information, we comply with standard industry   procedures to ensure that it is properly deleted or rendered unreadable.</p>
<h3>Children</h3>
<p>CTIA will not   intentionally collect any personal information (such as a child’s name or email address) from children under the age of 13 from the Super Mobility Week website   without parental consent. If you think that we have collected personal   information from a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, please   contact us using the information listed below in the section titled “Contacting   Us.”</p>

<h3>Correspondence &amp; Opting Out</h3>
<p>If you correspond with us via email, the postal service, or other form   of communication, we may retain such correspondence and the information   contained therein and use such to respond to your inquiry and/or notify you of future CTIA shows and events.

<p>When you choose to attend one of CTIA's shows and provide   personally identifiable information through our show registration pages, you   will be given an opportunity to opt in to receive future promotional and   marketing communications from CTIA and its carefully selected business partners   and third parties. The personal information provided by you will be held in a   database.&nbsp; If you initially choose   to opt in and decide later that you would like to opt out, you may follow the   requisite opt out procedures.&nbsp; Although   CTIA strives to update our mailing list database as frequently as possible, you   should allow for a reasonable period of time to process your request.&nbsp; Additionally, any mailing lists that may have   included personally identifiable information prior to your decision to opt out, cannot be retrieved by CTIA and you cannot   retroactively opt out with respect to third parties.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
