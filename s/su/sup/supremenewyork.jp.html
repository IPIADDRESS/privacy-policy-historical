	<li><strong>To let you know about in-store events.</strong>  You can register for in-store events by providing your name, email address, credit card information and mobile number (e.g., to validate your identity and send a text to let you know whether you have a place at the event).</li>

	<li><strong>To send you product or promotional information.</strong>  We use your email address to send you messages regarding our releases, products and other information we think may interest you. </li>

We also collect footage using CCTV cameras in our stores to ensure safety and to prevent and detect crime.  If we are requested to provide CCTV images by the police or any other regulatory or government authority investigating suspected illegal activities, we will do so consistent with our legal obligations.</li>

	<li><strong>With your consent. </strong> We will use your information for any other disclosed purposes or with your consent.</li>
	
	
</ul>

<p>Please note that we may combine information that we collect about you (including automatically collected information, described below) with other information we obtain about you, and use such combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We also aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the Services.  We use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, including promotional partners.</p>

<h2 id="cookies">Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies</h2>

<p>We use common online technologies to automatically collect information about the computer or devices you use to access the Services.  As described further below, we may collect and analyze information such as (1) IP addresses, location information, unique device identifiers, IMEI and TCP/IP address, and other information about your computer or device(s), browser types, browser language, operating system, mobile device carrier information, the state or country from which you accessed the Services; and (2) information related to the ways in which you interact with the Services, such as: referring and exit web pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content viewed and the order of those pages, statistical information about the use of the Services, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used the Services, the frequency of your use of the Services, error logs, and other similar information.  As described further below, we may use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.</p>

<p>We also collect data about your use of the Services through the use of Internet server logs, cookies and/or tracking pixels.  A web server log is a file where website activity is stored.  A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer when you visit a website, that enables us to: (1) recognize your computer; (2) store your preferences and settings; (3) understand the web pages of the Services you have visited; (4), enhance your user experience by delivering content and advertisements specific to your inferred interests; (5) perform searches and analytics; and (6) assist with security administrative functions.  Some cookies are placed in your browser cache while those associated with Flash technologies are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files.  Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of the Services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies.  We also may include web beacons in email messages, newsletters and other electronic communications to determine whether the message has been opened and for other analytics, personalization and advertising.  As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.</p>
<p>Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.  Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information (e.g., <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies">Internet Explorer</a>; <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en">Google Chrome</a>; <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Cookies#Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a>; or <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/PH5042">Apple Safari</a>).  Please note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.</p>
<p>We also use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics and Mixpanel) on our Services to collect and analyze the information discussed above, and to engage in auditing, research or reporting.  The information (including your IP address) collected by various analytics technologies described in this section will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, analyzing usage trends, assisting with fraud prevention, and providing certain features to you.  To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">clicking here</a>.  You can opt out of Mixpanel’s automatic retention of data by <a href="https://mixpanel.com/optout">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs, to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.  We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry continues to define the concept and develop a common approach.  You can learn more about Do Not Track at <a href="http://allaboutdnt.com/">http://allaboutdnt.com/</a>.</p>
