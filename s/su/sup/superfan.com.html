  <h2>1. BRANCHOUT BASICS</h2>
  <p>Through the BranchOut Services, you have the opportunity for
    potential employers, business partners, BranchOut customers,
    professional contacts and friends to find and learn about you based
    on your existing Facebook profile, which is the basis for your
    BranchOut profile. We allow our members to learn about business
    opportunities and jobs and obtain Introductions.</p>
  <p>Users may be individual job seekers, recruiters, sales
    professionals or others looking for professional connections. There
    are primarily two types of users on BranchOut:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>BranchOut User.</strong> A BranchOut User is a user who has
      registered to join BranchOut by installing any of the BranchOut
      Services or who has otherwise logged into BranchOut to use the
      BranchOut Services.</li>
    <li><strong>Connections.</strong> Your Connections consist of your connections
      to (1) other BranchOut Users and (2) persons who are not BranchOut
      Users, but are connected to you through your Facebook social
      network (e.g., a Facebook friend or a second-degree Facebook
      friend). A BranchOut User who searches for a job, a company or
      organization, or a person on BranchOut will see any Connections he
      or she has to the applicable company (or organization) or person.</li>
    <li><strong>Enterprise Users.</strong> Enterprise Users are BranchOut Users who
      are recruiters, sales professionals and other customers looking
      for qualified candidates, business partners, and sales leads. We
      may charge Enterprise Users a fee for accessing the BranchOut
      Services and we may offer special services to Enterprise Users.
      Like all BranchOut Users, Enterprise Users will have access to
      view your BranchOut Profile and Connections and may contact you
      through the communication tools provided by Facebook.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="last">Please note that your BranchOut Profile and your Connections
    will be visible to all other users of BranchOut. You will be able to
    contact other BranchOut users through their Facebook page and in
    accordance with their settings on Facebook. Other BranchOut Users
    will be able to contact you in the same way, also in accordance with
    your settings through Facebook.</p>

  <h2>2. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE BRANCHOUT SERVICES</h2>

  <ol class="let">
    <li><strong>Information We Receive From Facebook</strong>
      <p>BranchOut believes that your friends and family are your
        true support network both personally and professionally. Thus,
        BranchOut allows you to establish a professional network on
        BranchOut based on your Facebook friends and their network.
      </p><p>By accessing BranchOut with your Facebook log-in
        credentials, you are authorizing BranchOut to collect, store,
        and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, any and all
        information that you agreed that Facebook could provide to
        BranchOut. You may also grant us additional permissions at other
        times. Information is provided to us by Facebook under the terms
        of Facebook's data use policy (or other applicable Facebook
        policy).</p>
      <p>BranchOut will access and store certain information from
        your current Facebook profile (for example, your first and last
        name, email address, current city and state, your work history
        and education, your profile picture, your Facebook user ID
        number and demographic information, such as your age and gender,
        as well as other information that you have made public on
        Facebook), all in accordance with the permissions you have
        granted BranchOut. We also access your friends' and their
        friends' names and applicable user ID number, profile photos,
        work history and education so that you can create and build your
        professional network.</p>
      <p>In order to help you instantly build your professional
        network, BranchOut will continue to update your network of
        friends and their friends, but the rest of your BranchOut
        profile will not change if you change your Facebook profile.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Information We Collect From You Directly</strong>
      <p>In addition to the information we receive from Facebook,
        when you use the BranchOut Services, we may ask you to provide
        personally identifiable information, which is information that
        identifies you as a specific individual ("Personal
        Information"), and other information about you, such as
        demographic information (your gender, ZIP code or similar
        information), registration and payment information (typically,
        credit card account information), and certain information about
        your preferences and interests. If we combine demographic, or
        similar information with the Personal Information we collect, we
        will treat the combined information as Personal Information
        under this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>The BranchOut Services are not intended for children
        younger than the age of 13. If we learn that we have
        inadvertently gathered personal information from children
        younger than the age of 13, we will take reasonable measures to
        delete such information from our records.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Your BranchOut Profile</strong>
      <p>Your BranchOut Profile consists of information provided by
        you or that you have allowed us to access through your Facebook
        account. Your BranchOut Profile is visible to all BranchOut
        Users.</p>
    </li>

    <li><a name="cookies" class="tocLink"></a><strong>Information Collected Automatically When You Interact</strong>
      <p>With The BranchOut Services — Cookies And Similar
      Technologies.</p>
      <p>We and our third party service providers, including third
        party network advertising companies and content providers, may
        use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively
        collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with
        the BranchOut Services ("Usage Information"). Usage Information
        may include the browser and operating system you are using, the
        URL or advertisement that referred you to the BranchOut
        Services, the search terms you entered into a search engine that
        lead you to BranchOut (if applicable), and information about
        your interactions with the BranchOut Services (such as the pages
        and content you view and actions you take, the time you accessed
        BranchOut, and the duration of that period of access), among
        other information.</p>
      <p>In addition, Usage Information also includes your IP
        address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for any
        computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a "Device") you may
        use to access the BranchOut Services. A Device Identifier is a
        number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to
        access a web site, and our servers identify your Device by its
        Device Identifier. If you use the BranchOut Services on a mobile
        device, we may also receive information about your mobile
        device, such as your UDID, mobile operating system, the name of
        your mobile carrier, and your location information (e.g., GPS
        coordinates or network-based location).</p>
      <p>The methods we may use to collect Usage Information include
        the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cookies: A cookie is a data file placed on a Device
          when it is used to visit the BranchOut Services or otherwise
          access our online content. Cookies may be used for many
          purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and
          your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. A
          Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe
          Flash plugin that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to
          your Device. Flash cookies may be used for various purposes,
          including, without limitation, enabling a Flash feature and
          remembering your preferences. For more information about Flash
          and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit this site. If you
          choose to disable cookies or to adjust your Flash privacy
          settings on your Device, some features of the BranchOut Site
          may not function properly.</li>
        <li>Web Beacons: A web beacon is a small (often invisible)
          graphic image or other web programming code embedded in a web
          page or email. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used
          for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to
          count visitors to the BranchOut Services, to monitor how users
          navigate the BranchOut Services and to count how many e-mails
          that were sent were actually opened.</li>
        <li>Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming
          code that is designed to collect information about your
          interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on.
          The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our
          server or a third party service provider and is deactivated or
          deleted thereafter.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies
        that collect similar information for security and fraud
        detection purposes.
    </p></li>

    <li><strong>Information We Receive From Third Parties</strong>
      <p>We may receive information about you from third parties.
        For example, if you are on another web site or are using another
        app and you agree to receive information from BranchOut, that
        web site or app will forward your contact and other information
        to us so that we may contact you as requested.</p>
      <p>BranchOut may offer you the ability to import your
        professional information from your resume or through third party
        services so that you can display such information in your
        BranchOut Profile. Any information that you choose to import
        will become part of your BranchOut Profile. BranchOut may also
        offer the ability to help you import your contacts to the
        BranchOut Services, for instance, by asking for your login
        information for your email account. If you choose to import
        contacts, BranchOut will store those contacts for purposes of
        helping you and your contacts make connections on BranchOut.
        BranchOut will not store the passwords you provided without your
        consent.</p>
      <p>As noted above, once you choose to log-in with your
        Facebook credentials, BranchOut receives certain information
        from Facebook when you use the BranchOut Services. In addition,
        we may receive information about you if other users of Facebook
        give us access to their profiles and you are one of their
        "connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible

        other third party web site or interactive service.</p>
      <p class="last">We also may supplement the information we collect with
        outside records from third parties in order to provide you with
        information, services or goods you have requested. We may
        combine the information we receive from those other sources with
        information we collect through the BranchOut Services. In those
        cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined
        information.</p>

    including Personal Information and Usage Information, to register
    you for, and enable you to use, the BranchOut Services; to help

  <h2>4. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</h2>
  <p>We do not share your Personal Information with third parties
    for their direct marketing purposes. We may share your information
    (which may include Personal Information and Usage Information) with
    third parties (not BranchOut) with your consent, as disclosed in
    this privacy policy or at the time you provide us with information,
    and in the following circumstances:</p>
  <p>Third Party Service Providers. We may provide information to
    service providers that help us bring you the services we offer. For
    example, we may use third parties to help host the BranchOut Site,
    send out email updates about BranchOut, remove repetitive
    information from our user lists, process payments, or provide search
    results or links (including sponsored links). If you purchase any
    products or services from BranchOut, our billing partner will
    receive billing and financial information (e.g., credit card
    numbers) necessary to process your charges, including your postal
    and e-mail addresses, depending on your payment method.</p>
  <p>Legal Requests, Investigations and Safety. We may transfer and
    disclose information, including Personal Information and Usage
    Information, to third parties to comply with a legal obligation;
    when we believe in good faith that the law requires it; at the
    request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; to
    verify or enforce our&nbsp;Terms of Services&nbsp;or other applicable
    policies; to respond to an emergency; or otherwise to protect the
    rights, property, safety, or security of third parties, users of the
    BranchOut Services or the public. We may also use Device Identifiers
    to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright
    owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers or
    law enforcement agencies, in our discretion.</p>
  <p>Business Transfers. We may share information, including
    Personal Information, with our parents, subsidiaries, and
    affiliates, primarily for business and operational purposes.
    BranchOut reserves the right to disclose and transfer user
    information, including Personal Information, in connection with a
    corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of certain
    stock and/or assets, or other corporate change including, without
    limitation, during the course of any due diligence process.</p>
  <p>Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions. We may offer sweepstakes,
    contests, and other promotions (each, a "Promotion") that may
    require registration. If you choose to participate in a Promotion,
    your Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties in
    connection with the administration of such Promotion, such as in
    connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required
    by law, such as on a winners list. By entering a Promotion, you are
    agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may
    contain specific requirements of you, including, except where
    prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor and/or other parties to use
    your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing
    materials.</p>
  <p class="last">Non-Personal Information. We may share non-personal
    information, such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties
    for a variety of purposes, but we only do so in such a way that no
    individual user is specifically identified or specifically linked to
    any action or information.</p>

  <h2>5. ANALYTICS, ADVERTISING, AND SIMILAR THIRD PARTIES</h2>
  <p>Although the BranchOut Service currently does not display ads
    from third parties, BranchOut works with network advertisers, ad
    agencies, third party traffic measurement services and other vendors
    to provide us with information regarding traffic through the
    BranchOut Services, to serve our advertisements on other web sites,
    within third party applications, and across the Internet, and to
    provide us with information regarding the use of the BranchOut
    Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. In connection
    with providing analytics and advertisement services, our service
    providers may collect certain information about your visits to this
    or other Services. Some of these parties may collect Personal
    Information when you use the BranchOut Services or other web sites
    or services. These service providers may also set and access their
    own tracking technologies on your computer or device (including
    cookies and web beacons) and may otherwise collect or have access to
    information about you (such as your general interest in career
    networking and Usage Information). Cookies and web beacons,
    including those set by third party network advertisers, may be used
    to, among other things, target advertisements, prevent you from
    seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct
    research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.
    We may share Usage Information about visitors with third party
    advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors for
    similar purposes.</p>
  <p class="last">While we may use a variety of service providers to perform
    advertising services for us, some of these companies are members of
    the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") or the Digital
    Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online
    Behavioral Advertising. You may want to visit
    http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, which
    provides information regarding targeted advertising and the
    "opt-out" procedures of NAI members. You may also want to visit or
    http://www.aboutads.info/choices/, which provides information
    regarding targeted advertising and offers an "opt-out" by
    participating companies in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program. Please
    note that these opt-out mechanisms are not opt-outs from all online
    advertising.&nbsp; Even if you opt-out, you will continue to see generic
    ads online.</p>
