Our contract will apply to the services we provide to you in arranging your flight or other travel arrangements (including agency services) however if there is any conflict between our contract and the operator's conditions of carriage, the operator's conditions of carriage will take priority. </p><h4 id="terms_packageHolidays">Package Holidays</h4><p>If you book a package holiday through us, once your package holiday has been confirmed we will accept responsibility for it in accordance with these Booking Conditions as an "organiser" under the Package Travel, Package Holidays and Package Tours Regulations 1992. A "package holiday" is a combination of at least two out of (a) transport, (b) accommodation or (c) other tourist services (not ancillary to any transport or accommodation and forming a significant part of the arrangements) where booked through us at the same time, for which payment is made to us and which last at least 24 hours or include overnight accommodation. </p><h4 id="terms_groups">Groups</h4><p>Group reservations of 10 or more adults or 5 or more rooms are subject to different terms and conditions, a copy of which is available on request.</p><h4 id="terms_makingYourBooking">1. Making your booking</h4><p>The party leader must be authorised to make the booking on the basis of these Booking Conditions by all persons named on the booking and by their parent or guardian for all party members who are under 18 when the booking is made. The party leader is responsible for making all payments due to us. The party leader must be at least 18 when the booking is made. When making a booking, you must pay to us the payments referred to in clause 2 below.</p><p>If you book with us on line via a website, at the end of the booking process, you are asked to confirm that you have read and agree with our Booking Conditions. The final page gives you a booking reference which is your confirmation, which we will reconfirm to you if you have provided your email address.</p><p>If booking by telephone or any other communication channel, on receipt of your booking and all appropriate payments we will, subject to availability, confirm your holiday by issuing a confirmation invoice to the party leader or travel agent.</p><p>Please check any documentation carefully as soon as you receive it. Contact us immediately if any information which appears on the confirmation or any other document appears to be incorrect or incomplete as it may not be possible to make changes later.</p><h4 id="terms_payment">2. Payment</h4><p>Full payment is required at the time of booking</p><p>For flight inclusive bookings, all monies paid to any authorised travel agent of ours for your holiday with us will be held on behalf of and for the benefit of the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust subject to the travel agent's obligation to pay such monies to us in accordance with our trading terms unless we fail. In the unlikely event of our financial failure, all monies then held by the travel agent or subsequently paid by you to the travel agent will be held by the agent on behalf of and for the benefit of the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust without any obligation on the agent to pay such monies to us.</p><p>For holidays which do not include flights arranged by us, all monies you pay to one of our authorised travel agents for your holiday with us will be held by the agent on your behalf until we issue our confirmation invoice. After that point, your agent will hold the monies on our behalf.</p><h4 id="terms_yourContract">3. Your contract</h4><p>A binding contract between us comes into existence when either we dispatch our confirmation invoice or, for on line bookings, when the final page of the booking confirmation procedure gives you a booking reference. We reserve the right to decline any booking at our discretion. This contract and all matters arising out of it are governed by English law. We both agree that any dispute, claim or other matter which arises out of or in connection with this contract or your holiday will be dealt with by the Courts of England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland as appropriate. Changes to these Booking Conditions will only be valid if agreed by us in writing.</p><h4 id="terms_theCostOfYourHoliday">4. The cost of your holiday</h4><p>There are different ways of confirming the final price of your holiday depending upon whether you book by telephone or on line.</p><h4>By Telephone</h4><p>We reserve the right to increase or decrease the prices of unsold breaks at any time. The price of your chosen break will be confirmed at the time of booking.</p><p>We reserve the right to correct errors in both advertised and confirmed prices. We will do so as soon as we become aware of the error. Accommodation rates and meals as described in the accommodation entry may not apply over Easter/Christmas/New Year or certain dates associated with special events.</p><h4>Online</h4><p>The prices shown on our website are for guidance only until you enter our secure server, when the rates shown are guaranteed, subject to reasonableness with regard to any rates shown that are clearly incorrect. A total price of your chosen break will be given before you confirm your booking which you may accept or not.</p><p>Please note, the information and prices shown in brochures may have changed by the time you come to book your holiday. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of the brochure and prices at the time of printing, regrettably changes and errors do occasionally occur. You must therefore ensure you check all details of your chosen holiday (including the price) with us or your travel agent at the time of booking.</p><h4>Price Changes</h4><p>If changes to transportation costs, taxes, dues, fees or exchange rates arise before your departure date, we may pass on differences in cost after you have booked. We will absorb an increase of up to 2% of the cost of your holiday (excluding insurance premiums and amendment fees). However, there will be no price change within 30 days of your departure date.</p><h4 id="terms_changesByYou">5. Changes by you</h4><p>Should you wish to make any changes to your confirmed break, you must notify us (by post, telephone or email) as soon as possible. If a person is prevented from travelling, we will agree to that person's booking being transferred to another person who satisfies all the conditions applicable to the booking, subject to both persons accepting joint and several liability for full payment of the booking and our charge for confirming the transfer and any additional costs arising from the transfer. Whilst we will endeavour to assist, we cannot guarantee we will be able to meet any such requests. Where we can, an amendment fee of Â£15 per amendment (unless it is to increase the value of the booking) will be payable together with any costs incurred by ourselves and any costs or charges incurred or imposed by any of our suppliers. Any alteration requested by you on the day of travel (or in the case of overseas bookings, within 7 days of travel) will be treated as a cancellation by you and you will have to pay the cancellation charges set out in clause 6.</p><h4>Changes by you for flight, Eurostar or ferry inclusive packages</h4><p>Should you wish to make any changes to or cancel your confirmed flight, Eurostar or ferry inclusive break, you must notify us (by post, telephone or email) as soon as possible. The following charges will be applied in relation to changes (cancellation charges are set out in paragraph 6 below):-</p><p>Passenger name changes - Â£100 per name + any difference in price between the original booking and the price prevailing at the time of the change in relation to the new booking.</p><p>Date changes - Â£80 per person + any difference in price between the original booking and the price prevailing at the time of the change in relation to the new booking.</p><p>We are unable to allow requests for changes to departure airport or destination and 100% cancellation costs apply.</p><p><a href="/info/privacyandterms.htm#topLinks">Back To Top</a></p><h4 id="terms_cancellationByYou">6. Cancellation by you</h4><p>Should you or any member of your party need to cancel your booking once it has been confirmed, the party leader must immediately advise us (by post, telephone or email). Cancellations made directly with the hotel will not be effective. The following cancellation charges will be payable. Where the cancellation charge is shown as a percentage, this is calculated on the basis of the total cost payable by the person(s) cancelling excluding insurance premiums and amendment charges. Insurance premiums and amendment charges are not refundable or transferable in the event of the person(s) to whom they apply cancelling.</p><table id="cancelTable" class="borderCollapse" summary="Cancellation Charge Per Person Cancelling"><tbody><tr><td colspan="4" class="endCol"><strong>Cancellation Charge Per Person Cancelling</strong></td></tr><tr><th><strong>Period before departure within which written notification of cancellation is received by us</strong></th><th><strong>UK Holidays</strong></th><th><strong>Overseas Holidays</strong></th><th class="endCol"><strong>Overseas Transport inclusive holidays</strong></th></tr><tr><td>More than 28 days</td><td>10%</td><td>10%</td><td class="endCol">Loss of all monies paid over at the time of confirming the booking</td></tr><tr><td>15-28 days</td><td>20%</td><td>20%</td><td class="endCol">Loss of all monies paid over at the time of confirming the booking</td></tr><tr><td>8-14 days</td><td>20%</td><td>20%</td><td class="endCol">100%</td></tr><tr><td>1-7 days</td><td>20%</td><td>100%</td><td class="endCol">100%</td></tr><tr class="botrow"><td>On or after day of arrival</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td class="endCol">100%</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="boldText">The following charges apply to Theatre, Concert, Special Interest, Christmas and New Year Packages, Warner Breaks, Activity, Event and Entertainment Breaks and Visitor Oyster Cards (we recommend that you take out the insurance detailed on the booking form below):-</p><p>a) Cancellation/Amendment charge<br>i). 100% cancellation charge if you cancel at any time after confirmation of your holiday. However, we will, where possible seek to mitigate the charge by reselling any appropriate element of the break, although this may not be possible in all circumstances.<br>ii) We cannot be held liable for the cancellation of a show/event or the non-appearance of any particular cast member in a theatrical performance. If there is a significant change to your booking as a result of one of the aforementioned circumstances, we will firstly provide you with as much notice as possible (unless the significant change has happened on the day of the show/event/activity experience). You can then choose between accepting the change/alternative offered or cancelling the booking, in which case we will refund you in full for any monies paid.</p><p>b) Children's Prices<br>Please ask for details.</p><p>Where applicable, any rail tickets you have purchased through us must be returned to us unused and at your expense within 28 days of the date of cancellation before any refund can be given. We recommend that you send the unused tickets to us by a secure postal method as no refund will be given if the unused tickets are not received by us.</p><p>Where any cancellation reduces the number of full paying party members below the number on which the price, number of free places and/ or any concessions agreed for your booking were based, we will recalculate these items and re-invoice you accordingly.</p><p>Depending on the reason for cancellation, you may be able to reclaim these cancellation charges (less any applicable excess) under the terms of your insurance policy. Claims must be made directly to the insurance company concerned.</p><p><a href="/info/privacyandterms.htm#topLinks">Back To Top</a></p><h4 id="terms_insurance">7. Insurance</h4><p>We consider adequate travel insurance to be essential. All premiums must be paid at the time of booking, as cover will not be effective until we receive all applicable premiums in full. It is your responsibility to ensure that the insurance cover you purchase is suitable and adequate for your particular needs.</p><p><a href="/Content/downloads/insurance/optimum_travel_insurance_2011.pdf?w=680&amp;h=500&amp;resize=yes&amp;sbar=yes" id="popup_insurancePDF" title="View the insurance Policy Summary (PDF)">View the insurance Policy Summary (PDF)</a></p><h4 id="terms_changesAndCancellationByUs">8. Changes and cancellation by us</h4><p>Occasionally, we have to make changes to and correct errors in brochure and other details both before and after bookings have been confirmed and cancel confirmed bookings and we must reserve the right to do so.</p><p>Occasionally, we have to make a "significant change". "Significant changes" include the following changes when made before departure; a change of UK airport, a significant change of your destination, a change of accommodation to that of a lower classification or standard for the whole or a major part of the time you are away, a change of accommodation area for the whole or a major part of the time you are away, a change of departure time by more than 12 hours or a cost increase of more than 10%. If we have to make a significant change or cancel, we will tell you as soon as possible. If there is time to do so before departure, we will offer you the choice of the following options:-</p><ul class="squareBullets"><li>(for significant changes) accepting the changed arrangements or</li><li>purchasing an alternative break from us, of a similar standard to that originally booked if available (subject to you paying any price differential between the two holidays). If the chosen alternative is less expensive than your original one, we will refund the difference.</li><li>cancelling or accepting the cancellation in which case you will receive a full and quick refund of all monies you have paid to us.</li></ul><p>Please note the above options are not available where any change made is a minor one.</p><p>If we have to make a significant change or cancel, we will pay you compensation where appropriate and depending on the circumstances and the length of time before your holiday we notify you of the significant change or cancellation, subject to the following exceptions. Compensation will not be payable and no liability beyond offering the above mentioned choices can be accepted where we are forced to make a change or cancel as a result of unusual and unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control, the consequences of which we could not have avoided even with all due care. No compensation will be payable and the above options will not be available if (1) we cancel as a result of your failure to comply with any requirement of these booking conditions entitling us to cancel (such as paying on time) or (2) we have to cancel because the minimum number of bookings necessary for us to operate your holiday has not been reached - in this case we will however, give you at least 7 days' notice.</p><p>In all cases, our liability for significant changes and cancellations is limited to offering you the above mentioned options and, where applicable, compensation.</p><p>We regret we are not in a position to offer you any assistance in the event of delay at your outward or homeward point of departure.</p><h4 id="terms_forceMajeure">9. Force Majeure</h4><p>Except where otherwise expressly stated in these booking conditions, we regret we cannot accept liability or pay any compensation where the performance or prompt performance of our contractual obligations is prevented or affected by or you otherwise suffer any damage or loss (as more fully described in clause 10(1) below) as a result of "force majeure". In these Booking Conditions, "force majeure" means any event which we or the supplier of the service(s) in question could not, even with all due care, foresee or avoid. Such events may include, whether actual or threatened, war or threat of war, riot, civil strife, terrorist activity, industrial dispute, natural or nuclear disaster, adverse weather conditions, fire and all similar events outside our control.</p><h4 id="terms_ourLiabilityToYou">10. Our Liability to you</h4><p>(1) We promise to make sure that all parts of the break we have agreed to arrange, perform or provide as part of our contract with you are arranged, performed or provided with reasonable skill and care. We will accept responsibility if any death, personal injury, failure or deficiency of your arrangements is caused by any failure by ourselves or our employees (providing they were at the time acting within the course of their employment) and (but only if you have booked a package holiday from us), our agents or suppliers (as applicable) to use reasonable skill and care in performing or providing the service in question. Please note it is your responsibility to show that reasonable skill and care has not been used if you wish to make a claim.</p><p>We will not be responsible for any injury, illness, death, loss (for example loss of enjoyment), damage, expense, cost or other sum or claim of any description whatsoever which results from any of the following: -</p><ul class="squareBullets"><li>the fault of the person(s) affected or any member(s) of their party or</li><li>the fault of a third party not connected with the provision of your break which we could not have predicted or avoided or</li><li>an event or circumstance which we or the supplier of the service(s) in question could not have predicted or avoided even after taking all reasonable care (see clause 9)</li><li>the fault of anyone who is not carrying out work for us (generally or in particular) at the time</li></ul><p>In addition, we will not be responsible where you do not enjoy your break or suffer any problems because of a reason you did not tell us about when you booked your break or where any problems you suffer did not result from any breach of our contract or other fault of ourselves or, if you have booked a package holiday from us and we were responsible for them, our suppliers or agents or where any losses, expenses, costs or other sum you have suffered relate to any business.</p><p>We cannot accept responsibility for any services which do not form part of our contract. This includes, for example, any additional services or facilities which your accommodation provider or any other supplier agrees to provide for you where the services or facilities are not advertised in our brochure or on our website and we have not agreed to arrange them.</p><p>(2) The promises we make to you about the services we have agreed to provide or arrange as part of our contract - and the laws and regulations of the country in which your claim or complaint occurred if not the UK - will be used as the basis for deciding whether the services in question had been properly provided. If the particular services which gave rise to the claim or complaint complied with local laws and regulations applicable to those services at the time, the services will be treated as having been properly provided. This will be the case even if the services did not comply with the laws and regulations of the UK which would have applied had those services been provided in the UK. The exception to this is where the claim or complaint concerns the absence of a safety feature which might lead a reasonable holiday maker to refuse to take the holiday in question.</p><p>(3) Where any claim or part of a claim concerns or is based on any travel arrangements (including the process of getting on and off the transport concerned) provided by any air, sea, road or rail carrier or any stay in accommodation which we agree to supply to you as part of our contract, the maximum amount of compensation we will have to pay you will be limited. The most we will have to pay you for that claim or that part of a claim if we are found liable to you on any basis is the most the carrier or accommodation provider concerned would have to pay under the international convention which applies to the travel arrangements or accommodation stay in question (copies available on request). Please note: Where a carrier or accommodation provider would not be obliged to make any payment to you under the applicable International Convention or Regulation in respect of a claim or part of a claim, we similarly are not obliged to make a payment to you for that claim or part of the claim. When making any payment, we are entitled to deduct any money which you have received or are entitled to receive from the transport or accommodation provider for the complaint or claim in question.</p><p>(4) You must provide ourselves and our insurers with all assistance we may reasonably require. You must also tell us and the supplier concerned about your claim or complaint as set out in clause 11 below. If asked to do so, you must transfer to us or our insurers any rights you have against the supplier or whoever else is responsible for your claim or complaint (if the person concerned is under 18, their parent or guardian must do so). You must also agree to cooperate fully with us and our insurers if we or our insurers want to enforce any rights which are transferred.</p><h4 id="terms_complaintsAndProblems">11. Complaints and problems</h4><p>In the unlikely event that you have any reason to complain or experience any problems with your break whilst away, you must immediately inform the supplier of the service(s) in question. Any verbal notification must be put in writing and given to the supplier as soon as possible. If you are still dissatisfied, you must notify us at the earliest opportunity. Until we know about a problem or complaint, we cannot begin to resolve it. If you remain dissatisfied, however, you must write to our Customer Relations Manager within 28 days of the end of the break you have purchased from us giving your booking reference and full details of your complaint. In the event that you do not notify us of the complaint within the above period, this may affect the company's ability to investigate complaints and may impact on the way that your complaint is dealt with.</p><h4 id="terms_behaviour">12. Behaviour</h4><p>When you book with us, you accept responsibility for any damage or loss caused by you or any member of your party. Full payment for any such damage or loss must be paid direct at the time to the accommodation owner or manager or other supplier. If you fail to do so, you will be responsible for meeting any claims subsequently made against us (together with our own and the other party's full legal costs) as a result of your actions.</p><p>We expect all clients to have consideration for other people. If in our reasonable opinion or in the reasonable opinion of any other person in authority, you or any member of your party behaves in such a way as to cause or be likely to cause danger, upset or distress to any third party or damage to property, we are entitled, without prior notice, to terminate the holiday of the person(s) concerned. In this situation, the person(s) concerned will be required to leave the accommodation or other service. We will have no further responsibility toward such person(s) including any return travel arrangements. No refunds will be made and we will not pay any expenses or costs incurred as a result of the termination.</p><h4 id="terms_conditionsOfSuppliers">13. Conditions of suppliers</h4><p>Many of the services which make up your break are provided by independent suppliers (for example, where applicable, rail carriers, airlines and accommodation owners). Those suppliers provide these services in accordance with their own terms and conditions. Some of these terms and conditions may limit or exclude the supplier's liability to you, usually in accordance with applicable International Conventions (see clause 10 (3)). Copies of the relevant parts of these terms and conditions are available on request from the supplier concerned.</p><h4 id="terms_specialRequestsAndMedicalProblems">14. Special requests and medical problems</h4><p>If you have any special request, you must advise us at the time of booking. Although we will endeavour to pass any reasonable requests on to the relevant supplier, we regret we cannot guarantee any request will be met. Failure to meet any special request will not be a breach of contract on our part. Confirmation that a special request has been noted or passed on to the supplier or the inclusion of the special request on your confirmation invoice or any other documentation is not confirmation that the request will be met. Unless and until specifically confirmed, all special requests are subject to availability.</p><p>If you or any member of your party has any medical problem or disability which may affect your holiday, please tell us before you confirm your booking so we can assist you in considering the suitability of your booking. In any event, you must give us full details in writing at the time of booking. If we reasonably feel unable to properly accommodate the particular needs of the person concerned, we must reserve the right to decline their reservation or, if full details are not given at the time of booking, cancel when we become aware of these details.</p><h4 id="terms_passportsVisasAndHealthRequirements">15. Passports, visas and health requirements</h4><p>You should check the passport, visa and health requirements which are applicable to the country(ies) which you intend to visit. Requirements may change and you must check the up to date position in good time before departure. For British Citizens, information on health is contained in the Department of Health leaflet T6 (Health Advice for Travellers) available from your local Department of Health office and most Post Offices. For European holidays you should obtain a European Health Insurance Card - EHIC (details in leaflet T6 referred to above) prior to departure.</p><p>It is the party leader's responsibility to ensure that all members of the party are in possession of all necessary travel and health documents before departure. All costs incurred in obtaining such documentation must be paid by you. We regret we cannot accept any liability if you are refused entry onto any transport or into any country due to failure on your part to carry correct documentation. If failure to have any necessary travel or other documents results in fines, surcharges or other financial penalty being imposed on us, you will be responsible for reimbursing us accordingly.</p><h4 id="terms_financialSecurity">16. Financial security</h4><p>Superbreak Mini-Holidays Ltd holds an Air Travel Organiser's Licence issued by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) (ATOL number 10518).  This means the package holidays inclusive of air travel are <abbr title="Air Travel Organiser's Licence">ATOL</abbr> protected. We, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL Certificate, will provide you with the services listed on the ATOL Certificate (or a suitable alternative). In some cases, where neither we nor the supplier are able to do so for reasons of insolvency, an alternative ATOL holder may provide you with services you have bought or a suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you). You agree to accept that in those circumstances the alternative ATOL holder will perform those obligations and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your contract to that alternative ATOL holder. However, you also agree that in some cases it will not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be entitled to make a claim under the ATOL scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable). For further information, visit the ATOL website at <a href="http://www.atol.org.uk" title="ATOL Website">www.atol.org.uk</a>.</p><p>For non flight-inclusive package holidays only we hold a bond with <abbr title="Association of British Travel Agents">ABTA</abbr>. This arrangement means your money will be refunded or you will be brought back to the UK (where your contracted holiday arrangements include return travel to the UK) if already abroad in the unlikely event of our being unable to provide your break due to our insolvency.</p><p>For accommodation only bookings overseas, all customer monies are held in a Trust Account approved by Trading Standards and reviewed by our auditors. This arrangement means your money for this type of booking will be refunded in the unlikely event of our being unable to provide your accommodation due to our insolvency.</p><h4 id="terms_airlineFailure>Airline failure</h4><p>Your holiday is protected in the event of failure of your airline. In the unlikely event that the airline that you are travelling with ceases trading during your holiday, you must contact us, in order that we can make alternative arrangements. We will not be liable for any additional costs incurred if you make your own arrangements.</p><h4 id=" terms_safetystandards"="">17. Safety standards</h4><p>Please note, it is the requirements and standards of the country in which any services which make up your holiday are provided which apply to those services and not those of the UK. As a general rule, these requirements and standards will not be the same as the UK and may sometimes be lower.</p><h4 id="terms_hotelBreaksMinimumStayAndMeals">18. Accommodation Breaks - Minimum stay and meals</h4><p>Certain breaks / accommodation may require minimum lengths of stay. Where an accommodation provider offers dinner this may be table d'hote, a carvery or may sometimes be in the form of an allowance against the Ã  la carte menu. Some accommodation providers offer continental breakfast only. This normally consists of coffee or tea and bread rolls.</p><h4 id="terms_saverOffers">19. Saver Offers</h4><p>Where an accommodation provider features more than one offer at any one time (including 7 nights for 6), it may not always be possible to combine them - normally the most advantageous offer will be allowed. (7 nights for 6 prices shown do not include single supplements, which are charged in addition where applicable.) All offers are subject to availability (and are not usually available over Easter/Christmas/New Year), and may be withdrawn at any time.</p><h4 id="terms_childrenAndInfants">20. Children and Infants</h4><p>Any policy regarding special rates for children and infants is set out in our brochure or is available on request. However, wherever possible children stay free or at 50% of the adult price and exact prices will be confirmed when booking. Free children rates do not normally include meals which are normally paid direct to the accommodation provider as taken. If you contravene this policy a supplement may be payable to us or to our suppliers directly so that the correct price for the relevant service is paid. At some accommodation children may be charged a flat rate for meals, whether taken or not. Where children only pay 50% of the adult rate, half portions will be served for the meals included in the package price. Certain accommodations may apply restricted access times for children into leisure facilities - please ask for details at the time of booking.</p><h4 id="terms_railInclusiveBreaks">21. Rail Inclusive Breaks</h4><p>Rail inclusive breaks can be booked on line for most of our UK accommodation. Rail may be booked without accommodation to certain UK airport stations only if you are going onto travel outside of the UK. Please note that you may be asked to produce either your flight tickets or your Superbreak confirmation by ticket inspectors. Bookings must not be made for travel within 3 working days of booking as tickets are dispatched from our office and cannot be collected at rail stations. Some rail inclusive offers that feature in our brochures cannot be booked on line and you need to call us to add these offers to your booking. <span class="bold">Any differences to the booking conditions for rail inclusive breaks noted below are shown on the back of rail tickets - please check before travelling.</span></p><ul class="squareBullets"><li>The day on which you travel should coincide with the start of your break.</li><li>For journeys to or via London, your rail ticket is not valid on trains scheduled to arrive before 10am Monday-Friday inclusive. This restriction does not apply for journeys started before 2am that day - please inform us if you intend to travel overnight and your ticket can be dated accordingly.</li><li>For rail journeys passing through London, your ticket is valid on London Underground between your arrival and departure stations.</li><li>However, for London breaks or Heathrow Airport stopovers, London Underground travel from your mainline arrival station is not included.</li><li>Your holiday documentation must be carried at all times and shown to a Ticket Inspector on request as our rail fares are only sold in conjunction with accommodation.</li><li>Unless otherwise requested, only one rail ticket is issued per booking and all customers must travel from the same station.</li><li>Rail tickets may not be purchased in association with accommodation bookings for single rooms for one night only Monday to Thursday inclusive.</li><li>You should make your own seat and sleeper reservations direct with your local rail station, unless you are travelling as a group of 10 persons or more, in which case we will, on request, make your seat reservations for you. The fares quoted do not cover any incremental costs of seat reservations or sleeping car facilities.</li><li>Some small stations are closed on Sunday and First Class travel may not be available for the entire journey. Please check before travelling as no refund can be provided where services are not available.</li><li>Your journey may be affected by engineering works. It is your responsibility to check with National Rail Enquiries for dates and details.</li><li>UK rail services do not operate on 25/26 December and rail travel is not available on these dates.</li></ul><p>When you contact us to make a booking, we act as agent for all of the Train Operating Companies identified within the brochure. All tickets are issued subject to the normal conditions of the National Conditions of Carriage as published by the British Railway Board on 7 January 1997. Rail tickets are not transferable and are not valid for break of journey. Rail inclusive breaks are offered by Superbreak Mini-Holidays Limited and NOT by <abbr title="Association of Train Operating Companies">ATOC</abbr>, Train Operating Companies or the Secretary of State for Transport. The Double Arrows symbol is a trademark owned by the Secretary of State for Transport.</p><h4 id="terms_starRatings">22. Star Ratings</h4><p>We have awarded our own star ratings which do not necessarily relate to those awarded by other organisations, but are solely designed to help you choose between the various accommodation providers.</p><h4 id="terms_facilitiesAndCarParking">23. Facilities and Car Parking</h4><ul class="squareBullets"><li>We provide as much information as possible about each accommodation within the space available but you should check directly with us if you need to clarify any specific accommodation description and in particular, you should note that bedroom photographs are of a room in the accommodation and may not necessarily be the room allocated to you on arrival. It is also important that you check with your chosen accommodation if you require any special services such as babysitting, or if you want a room with sea view, etc. Payment for such services or special requirements should be made directly to the accommodation provider and you therefore need to check these charges with the accommodation provider prior to making your booking.</li><li>Where car parking and leisure facilities are available there may be an additional charge for these services, and leisure facilities may not always be in the same building as your accommodation. Again, you should check with the accommodation provider before making your booking. Please note that car parking may be quite limited at certain accommodation.</li><li>Airport accommodation offering car parking may use additional off-site parking facilities at peak times. Cars are left at owners own risk. We accept no liability for either theft or damage to vehicles parked at accommodation or off-site car parks.</li><li>Please note that upon arrival at your accommodation you may be asked for a credit card imprint or cash deposit to cover any additional expenses incurred during your stay.</li></ul><h4 id="terms_privacyStatement">24.
