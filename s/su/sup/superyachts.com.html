This may result in periodic changes to this Privacy Policy; however We are committed to protecting the privacy of Your personal information at all times. As a result, please remember to refer back to this Privacy Policy regularly to review any amendments. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. </p><p class="optionsHeading">3.0 Consent and acceptance of these Privacy Statement terms</p><p>By using Our Services, You unconditionally agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. </p><p>Data collection, usage and how Superyachts.com processes information from Your visits to Our Site, may be used in order to: </p><ul class="bullets"><li>Process and send Your requests to the relevant marketing agent. </li><li>Allow automated services such as emails and text that You have subscribed to as a Registered User. </li><li>Customise the information You receive from us via registration process, and which support any specific requests for information You may make through the use of any of Our features and functionality;</li><li>Send You information with which You have opted to receive, in the format You have chosen to receive it, which may include but is not limited to a yachtâ€™s particulars and articles of interest.</li><li>Forward only the information You provide to a specified Marketing Agent. </li><li>Improve Our Services and Website. </li></ul><p class="optionsHeading">4.0 Registered Users &amp; Services </p><p>Although it is possible to browse Our Sites without submitting any personally identifiable information, it may prevent You from benefiting from some of Our products and services We may offer.</p><p>By completing an online registration successfully this will enable full use of Our Site's functionality. We save the details You provide and use them to enable us to personalise the service We offer to You. If You choose not to provide certain details this may mean certain services are unable to operate. For example, without a valid mobile number Our Yacht Alert service will be unable to send You a text that a superyacht of interest has suddenly become available. </p><p class="optionsHeading">4.1 Email, SMS/Texts &amp; Other Service</p><p>Registered users can opt in to receive emails or sms/text alert services, or any other communications method Our services may provide. Following registration, We send You a Welcoming email <span class="highlight">asking You</span> to verify <span class="highlight">Your</span> password and username.</p><p>Unless You specify that You'd prefer not to hear from us, We might also use the e-mail address You provide at registration to contact You for promotional, administrative, or other reasons. You may have these communications terminated. </p><p>If You register with us and use the 'Yacht Alerts' feature to receive notification when new yachts matching Your criteria are available, We record the settings You use and which yacht details have been sent to You.</p><p>As a registered user, You are able to save a variety of information to Your account for access at a later date.

We ask You for Your information such as Your friend's name and email address so that Superyachts.com can email the relevant information to them. This information shall not be used for any marketing activities. We may forward <span class="highlight">information about You, (such as Your name or email) that You have provided Us with from the Registration process or otherwise in such communications You initiate to a party or person that is known to You.</span> Superyachts.com cannot be held responsible in any way whatsoever for any data You supply that may result in those not registered to Superyachts.com receiving information You have requested us to send them on Your behalf. We always recommend seeking the permission before providing a friend's or third partyâ€™s email address to any service a Site may offer; Superyachts.com or otherwise. </p><p class="optionsHeading">5.0 Information Request Forms for All Users</p><p>In addition to communication with Registered Users, Our Website provides form facilities for any User, (registered or otherwise) to request information on superyachts from Marketing Agents. Within the 'Yachts For Charter', 'Yachts for Sale' and 'Find Broker' section of the Site, all registered users contact information that has been provided at the time of registration will automatically populate the relevant data fields. Any data not provided by the registered User will have to be manually entered. </p><p>For Non Registered Users, any data provided by You, (such as name, email and telephone numbers) for the purpose of allowing Marketing Agents to contact You may be stored by Us for the sole use of Superyachts.com and its clients and will not be passed onto or sold to any third party. For clarity, this information is only supplied directly to the contact details given to Us by a Marketing Agent and is not supplied via any third party. </p><p>You may occasionally see contests, surveys, and other features of Our Web Site that ask You to provide us with information. When You choose to respond to these requests, the information You offer may be used for several reasons. They may also include providing information to third parties as necessary for prize fulfilment and other aspects of any contest or similar offering. If We are going to use Your personal information for any other purpose, We will notify You of that purpose and give You a chance to opt out before responding to Our survey, contest form, or other request, or give You the option not to respond to or participate in the survey, contest or other request.</p><p class="optionsHeading">6.0 Yacht Particulars On Superyachts.com</p><p>Superyachts.com policy is that only those brokers with central management rights awarded to them by yacht owners or operators can market a yacht on Our Site. We believe this policy is important as it helps to preserve the accuracy of the data for yachts available for sale or for charter. We cannot warrant the accuracy of the information displayed about any yacht advertised and You should always check the particulars with the agent concerned before relying on the content of this Site.</p><p>If You are the owner of a yacht being displayed for sale or for charter on Our Website, this is because the Marketing Agent You have chosen to use has a contract with us to display the details of Your yacht on Our Website and thereby placed the technical information about Your yacht fully in the public domain. Details held by us about a yacht do not comprise of personal data as defined by the Data Protection Act 1998.</p><p>If Your yacht is listed for sale or charter on superyachts.com and You require some or all information to be removed, such a request should be submitted to us via the Marketing Agent linked to Your yacht. If a Marketing Agent proclaims to have the right to market Your yacht when in fact no such rights have been granted or no Marketing Agent is directly linked to Your yacht, please inform us in writing and We shall suspend Your yacht from being advertised for sale or charter until such time that We receive evidence that a Marketing Agent has been granted the appropriate rights to market Your yacht on Your behalf. </p><p class="optionsHeading">7.0 Security </p><p>Superyachts.com places a great importance on the security of all information associated with Our customers. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and/or alteration of any customer data under Our control.
