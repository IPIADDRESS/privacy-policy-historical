Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most  to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this  Site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your  preferences. We may use cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits  to this Site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on  website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past  viewing history; save your password for ease of access to our Site. You can  disable cookies, although the Site may not function properly for you.

                              IP Addresses <br>
                              We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the  Site. We may use this information to do internal research on our users'  demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve  you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came  from (whether this URL is on the Site or not), which URL you next go to  (whether this URL is on the Site or not), your computer browser information,  and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") is a unique  Internet "address" which is assigned to you by your Internet Service  Provider ("ISP"). For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or  cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular  computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting  information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does not  identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be  used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can,  however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you  are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may  collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages. <br>
