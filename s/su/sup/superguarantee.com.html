</p>
<p>
<span class="pageTitle"><b>Privacy Policy Effective Date / Updates</b></span><br>
<span class="pageContent">	
This Privacy Policy is effective as of February 17, 2009. Our business changes constantly. Our Privacy Policy will change also, and information collected through This Website is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the information is collected (unless you consent otherwise as to information related to you). You are advised to check this web page (or such other page accessible by clicking on the Privacy Policy link in the footer of This Website) frequently to see recent changes.

<a name="infocollected"></a><b><font size="+1" color="gray">Information Idearc Collects</font></b><br>
<span class="pageTitle"><b>What information does This Website gather?</b></span><br><br>
<span class="pageContent">
When you visit This Website, Idearc may collect the following types of information:<br>
</span></p><ul>
<font color="red"><li><font color="#333333">Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide</font></li></font>
<font color="red"><li><font color="#333333">Information Idearc Collects Automatically</font></li></font>
<font color="red"><li><font color="#333333">Non-Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide</font></li></font>
</ul>
Idearc collects personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide to us. For example, Idearc may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information (such as name, address, Email address and telephone number). In addition, if you register with us or Sign in on This Website, Idearc may also ask you to provide other information such as a personal ID, password, and security question and answer. If you register for the SuperGuarantee<small><sup>SM</sup></small> Program, Idearc will ask you to provide additional information about any service appointment you register and may track your searches and any registrations, claims and ratings/reviews you file on This Website. If you file a claim under the SuperGuarantee<small><sup>SM</sup></small> Program, Idearc may ask you to provide additional information such as your Social Security number if required for IRS reporting purposes. 
<br><br>
In addition, as you (and other users) browse This Website, our web servers automatically collect certain information about such visits (usually through the use of <a href="#cookies" class="embedLink">cookies</a>, javascript tags, clear .gif files (also known as "web beacons"), and the analysis of http headers), such as the user's IP address, the user's domain name, the user's browser type, the user's user agent, how many users visit This Website, which pages the user visits and for how long, the date and time the user accesses This Website, the Internet address of the site from which the user directly linked to This Website and the links on This Website on which the user clicks. In addition, Idearc collects certain search parameters relating to searches conducted by the user which are not entered by the user.<br><br>
In some cases, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information that you provide, such as search parameters in connection with a search you conduct through This Website, ratings and reviews, and zip code.<br><br>
To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand This Website's capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future. We will update this Privacy Policy as our practices change to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.<br><br>

<p></p>
<p>
<span class="pageTitle"><b>How does Idearc use information collected on This Website?</b></span><br>
<span class="bodyCopy">
When users supply personally identifiable information about themselves for a specific purpose (for example, to register to use a feature on This Website, to receive information, to register a service appointment, or to file a claim), we may use such information for such purpose.
<br><br>
When users provide personally identifiable information to register for the SuperGuarantee<small><sup>SM</sup></small> Program or to register a service appointment or make a claim through This Website, we may also use such personally identifiable information as we would use the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner. For example, we may use such personally identifiable information to contact you in connection with your service registration or claim or user reviews.
<br><br>
We may also use personally identifiable information you provide to communicate with you (e.g., to send you Emails) and to otherwise serve you. For example, we may use your name and Email address to send you Emails to (a) confirm service appointment registrations, (b) discuss or request information about claims, and (c) otherwise communicate with you in connection with your participation in the SuperGuarantee<small><sup>SM</sup></small> Program.
<br><br>
In addition, Idearc may use personally identifiable information you provide and information Idearc automatically collects through This Website (and may combine personally identifiable information you provide with information Idearc automatically collects through This Website and non-personally identifiable information you knowingly provide) as it deems appropriate to protect its property or other rights (for example, to enforce any policies or contractual provisions regarding the SuperGuarantee<small><sup>SM</sup></small> Program). 
<br><br>
We use information Idearc automatically collects through This Website to improve This Website, to monitor its performance, to make This Website easier for you and other users to use, and to manage features and programs made available through This Website. For example, Idearc may use information Idearc automatically collects in the ways described in the section entitled 
"<a href="#cookies" class="embedLink">What is a cookie and why does Idearc use them?</a>", below.

Cookies help us to identify new and returning users to This Website, analyze click-stream data, and track historical activity on This Website, which allows us to give you a more personalized, useful experience on This Website.<br><br>

A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your hard drive. However, customers are free to delete website cookies. Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.<br><br>
You can choose to change your browser settings to disable cookies if you do not want us to establish and maintain a unique User ID. Please be aware that cookies may be required to complete certain functions on This Website, such as ordering products or services and My Superpages. To disable cookies, see "<a href="#cookieprefs" class="embedLink">Here is How to Your Cookie Preferences</a>", below.<br><br>
However, you need to understand that some websites/ad serving companies have the ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion, if you reenter the same site on another occasion, or some other site tracked by the ad serving company/network, and specifically provide personal data.<br><br>
Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent ad serving companies from reestablishing history on a user. The user must either continue to decline cookies each time it reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or opt-out. When you opt-out, your unique user ID cookie is erased and you are 
reassigned an anonymous, non-id cookie. This new cookie tells websites that you have opted out and they will then know not to attempt to assign other cookies to you in the future. Opt-out cookies do not contain a unique user ID number therefore websites are not able to identify your computer uniquely.<br><br>
Users who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have their browser advise them each time a website attempts to send a cookie to your system. At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel a cookie. Users who choose to "opt out" after deleting cookies will receive an anonymous/non personally identifiable cookie.<br><br>
