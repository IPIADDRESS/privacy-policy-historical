	        <br>
	         Thank you for visiting adultswim.com, a site presented to you by Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. ("Turner"). Your privacy is important to us. As such, we provide this privacy statement explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this Turner site, and among Turnerï¿½s network of affiliated websites ("Turner Network"), which includes any sites or services owned, operated or offered by or on behalf of Turner or its affiliates.  
	        <br>
	        <br>
			
			
	         <strong>The Information We Collect</strong>
	        <br>
	        <br>
			At some Turner Network sites, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities.

Examples of the types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.
	        <br>
	        <br>
			At some Turner Network sites, you may also be able to submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. Examples of the types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.
	        <br>
	        <br>

	        <br>
	        <br>

	        <br>
	        <br>

	        <br>
	        <br>
	We may on occasion combine information we collect through our sites with information that we collect from other sources.

			<strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong>
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.

	        <br>
	        <br>
	        In addition, we may transfer personally identifiable information about you if we, or one of our business units, are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another entity. 
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        Our agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this privacy statement by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this privacy statement.
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        We may disclose personally identifiable information to third parties whose practices are not covered by this privacy statement (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations) that want to market products or services to you. If a Turner Network site shares personally identifiable information, it will provide you with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses either at the point of submission of your personally identifiable information or prior to any such disclosure.
	        <br>
	        <br>

	        <br>
			
			
			<strong>Advertising Practices</strong>
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        This section describes certain of our advertising practices, such as the collection and use of information to deliver advertising.  We, our service providers, advertisers or partners may collect various types of non-personally identifiable information when you interact with us or visit any of our sites.  A representative list of the types of non-personally identifiable information that may be collected include: current Internet protocol address and type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink), the web pages you have visited, the content you have accessed and the advertisements you have been shown and/or clicked on. The non-personally identifiable information collected may be combined with information from other sources and/or shared with third parties.
	        <br>
	        <br>
			The non-personally identifiable information collected may be used to improve the design and content of our sites, and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience.  This information may also be used to provide you with additional product and service opportunities and to make inferences about your interests in order to deliver more relevant marketing messages and advertisements.  We also may use this information to analyze usage of our sites. 
	        <br>
			<br>
			The practices described in this section are enabled by the technologies and relationships described in the "Cookies &amp; Web Beacons" and "Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers, and Sponsors" sections below.     
	        <br>
			<br>
			
			
	        <strong>Cookies &amp; Web Beacons</strong>
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        To enhance your online experience, we use "cookies" or similar technologies.  Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information; however, once you choose to furnish a site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.
	        <br>
	        <br>
			We use cookies to understand site and Internet usage and to improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our sites (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites. We also may use cookies to help us offer you products, programs, or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising.    
			<br>
	        <br>
			We, our third party service providers, advertisers or our partners also may use cookies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Turner Network and/or other networks or sites.  This also helps us, our service providers and partners provide more relevant advertising.  For more information regarding third-party ad servers, see "Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers, and Sponsors" below.    
	 		<br>
	        <br>
			We, our third party service providers, advertiser or our partners may also use "web beacons" or clear .gifs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a web page, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page.   
			<br>
	        <br>
			You can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser.  You may set your browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or block all cookies.  Blocking all cookies will affect your online experience and may prevent you from enjoying the full features offered at Turner Network sites.

			<br>
	        <br>

	        <br>
			We also use the services of reputable third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting and ad response measurement, as well as to assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements.  These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies.  We, our third party service providers, advertisers and/or partners may also place web beacons for these third parties.  The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this privacy statement.
