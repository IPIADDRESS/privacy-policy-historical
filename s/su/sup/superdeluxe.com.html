	        <br>
	         Thank you for visiting adultswim.com, a site presented to you by Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. ("Turner"). Your privacy is important to us. As such, we provide this privacy statement explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this Turner site, and among Turnerâ€™s network of affiliated websites ("Turner Network"), which includes any sites or services owned, operated or offered by or on behalf of Turner or its affiliates.  
	        <br>
	        <br>
			
			
	         <strong>The Information We Collect</strong>
	        <br>
	        <br>
			At some Turner Network sites, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. In the course of these various offerings, we often seek to collect from you various forms of personal information.  Examples of the types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.
	        <br>
	        <br>
			At some Turner Network sites, you may also be able to submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. Examples of the types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.
	        <br>
	        <br>
			At certain parts of some of our sites, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings.
		    <br>
			<br>
			We, our service providers, advertisers and partners may collect various types of non-personally identifiable information when you visit any of our sites.  A representative list of the types of non-personally identifiable information we may collect include: current Internet protocol address and type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink), the web pages you have visited, the content you have accessed and the advertisements you have been shown and/or clicked on.
	        <br>
	        <br>
			
			
	        <strong>How We Use the Information</strong>
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you, to enforce the legal terms that govern your use of our sites, and/or for the purposes for which you provided the information.
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards. From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs, or services to them.
	        <br>
	        <br>
	       The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services.
	        <br>
	        <br>
	       If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a letter to our editors, comments sent to our television personalities, a posting to a blog or a discussion board), we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us.
	        <br>
	        <br>
	We may on occasion combine information we collect through our sites with information that we collect from other sources.
	        <br>
	        <br>
	We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our sites, to deliver more relevant marketing messages and advertisements and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience.  We also may use this information to analyze usage of our sites, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.  
	        <br>
	        <br>
			
			
			<strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong>
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our sites and applicable laws or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements.  
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        In addition, we may transfer personally identifiable information about you if we, or one of our business units, are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another entity. 
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        Our agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this privacy statement by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this privacy statement.
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        We may disclose personally identifiable information to third parties whose practices are not covered by this privacy statement (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations) that want to market products or services to you. If a Turner Network site shares personally identifiable information, it will provide you with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses either at the point of submission of your personally identifiable information or prior to any such disclosure.
	        <br>
	        <br>
			If you have signed up to receive our e-mails and prefer not to receive marketing information from this site, follow the "unsubscribe" instructions provided on any marketing e-mail you receive from this site. 
	        <br>
	        <br>
			To provide visitors with additional or more relevant product and service opportunities, we may share non-personally identifiable information with third parties.   
	        <br>
	        <br>
			
			
			<strong>Advertising Practices</strong>
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        This section describes certain of our advertising practices, such as the collection and use of information to deliver advertising.  We, our service providers, advertisers or partners may collect various types of non-personally identifiable information when you interact with us or visit any of our sites.  A representative list of the types of non-personally identifiable information that may be collected include: current Internet protocol address and type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink), the web pages you have visited, the content you have accessed and the advertisements you have been shown and/or clicked on. The non-personally identifiable information collected may be combined with information from other sources and/or shared with third parties.
	        <br>
	        <br>
			The non-personally identifiable information collected may be used to improve the design and content of our sites, and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience.  This information may also be used to provide you with additional product and service opportunities and to make inferences about your interests in order to deliver more relevant marketing messages and advertisements.  We also may use this information to analyze usage of our sites. 
	        <br>
			<br>
			The practices described in this section are enabled by the technologies and relationships described in the "Cookies &amp; Web Beacons" and "Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers, and Sponsors" sections below.     
	        <br>
			<br>
			
			
	        <strong>Cookies &amp; Web Beacons</strong>
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        To enhance your online experience, we use "cookies" or similar technologies.  Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information; however, once you choose to furnish a site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.
	        <br>
	        <br>
			We use cookies to understand site and Internet usage and to improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our sites (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites. We also may use cookies to help us offer you products, programs, or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising.    
			<br>
	        <br>
			We, our third party service providers, advertisers or our partners also may use cookies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Turner Network and/or other networks or sites.  This also helps us, our service providers and partners provide more relevant advertising.  For more information regarding third-party ad servers, see "Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers, and Sponsors" below.    
	 		<br>
	        <br>
			We, our third party service providers, advertiser or our partners may also use "web beacons" or clear .gifs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a web page, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page.   
			<br>
	        <br>
			You can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser.  You may set your browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or block all cookies.  Blocking all cookies will affect your online experience and may prevent you from enjoying the full features offered at Turner Network sites.

	        <strong>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers, and Sponsors</strong>
	        <br>
	        <br>
			Some of our sites contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.        
			<br>
	        <br>
			Turner Network sites covered by this privacy statement sometimes may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information. The site will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.
	        <br>
	        <br>
			We also use the services of reputable third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting and ad response measurement, as well as to assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements.  These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies.  We, our third party service providers, advertisers and/or partners may also place web beacons for these third parties.  The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this privacy statement. For more information on how our sites may use third-party ad servers and your ability to opt-out of targeted advertising from such third party ad servers, please see the section below on "Third Party Ad Servers".
