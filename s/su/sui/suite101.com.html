<h1><div class="limeTitle">Suite101 Privacy Policy</div></h1>
<p><br>
Protecting your privacy is important to Suite101.com Media Inc. ("Suite101").<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy explains how Suite101 collects, uses, and discloses the personal information you may provide while using suite101.com (the "Website") and the services provided through any of the Website. It is always your choice whether or not to provide personal information through the Website. Any personal information you provide will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<strong>Your Consent</strong><br>
<br>
1. By using or submitting information to this Website, you consent to Suite101's collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use or submit personal information to the Website.<br>
<br>
<strong>Information Automatically Collected</strong><br>
<br>
<em>2. Non-Personal Information</em> - As is typical with many other Internet sites, the Website automatically collects certain non-personal information regarding users, such as the date and time you access the Website, your IP address, the URL from which you linked to the Website, the operating system you are using, the Website pages read and images viewed, and any content you post to the Website. This non-personal information is used for Website and system administration purposes. Non-personal information may be disclosed to others and permanently archived for future use.<br>
<br>
<em>3. Cookies </em>- The Website uses "cookies," a technology that stores a small amount of information on a user's computer to permit the Website to recognize future visits using that computer. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the Website. For example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous user of the Website (so you do not have to enter your personal information every time), offer personalized content and information for your use and otherwise facilitate your Website experience.<br>
<br>
Some of the banner ads displayed in the Website are provided by outside companies. These ads contain cookies. While Suite101 uses cookies in other parts of the Website, cookies received with banner ads are collected by Suite101's advertisers and Suite101 does not have access to this information. Suite101 may engage third parties to provide cookies that collect information regarding Website use. You may choose to decline cookies generally if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of the Website and your ability to access certain features of the Website.<br>
<br>
<strong>Personal Information You Specifically Provide</strong><br>
<br>
<em>4. Your Personal Information</em> - During your use of the Website, you may be asked to voluntarily provide personal information (such as your name, e-mail address, and address) for communications with you. If you choose not to provide certain requested personal information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Website.<br>
<br>
<em>5. Use of Your Personal Information</em> - Suite101 may use your personal information to contact and correspond with you, respond to your communications, provide services to you, facilitate and enhance your use of the Website, and as otherwise permitted by law. Additionally, Suite101 may keep a record of all communications with you.<br>
<br>
Suite101 uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit its Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your search queries and visits to the Website and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">click here</a>.<br>
<br>
You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information online (whether through Suite101's services or any other service available online), personal or otherwise, that information can be collected and used by others. For example, if you use forums or if you post personal information online, you may receive unsolicited messages from others. Suite101 has no control over this use of your personal information.<br>
<br>
Suite101 allows its users to send articles or links by email to other parties who may be interested in them. Suite101 does not retain any email addresses of either the sender or recipient of such articles or links after they are sent.<br>
<br>
<em>6. E-mails from Suite101</em> - If you register as a Suite101 member, then Suite101 may send to you, from time to time, e-mail or other communications containing information about Suite101 and other matters that Suite101 believes will interest you. At any time you may ask Suite101 to stop sending you e-mail by sending your request by e-mail to <a href="javascript:location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(112,114,105,118,97,99,121,64,115,117,105,116,101,49,48,49,46,99,111,109)+'?'">privacy@suite101.com</a>.

<br>
<em>7. Disclosure of Your Personal Information</em> - Suite101 may disclose your personal information in the following circumstances and as otherwise permitted by applicable law:<br>

<em> b. Disclosure to Suite101 Business Associates</em> - Suite101 may provide your personal information to its affiliated businesses, advertisers, or suppliers and service providers for use in connection with the operation of the Website.

<br>
<em>8. Depersonalized Information</em> - Suite101 may use personal information to create non-personal information regarding the use of the Website and related services.

<em>14.

Each of those provisions applies to any disputes that may arise in relation to this Privacy Policy or Suite101's collection, use and disclosure of your personal information, and shall be of the same force and effect as if they had been reproduced directly in this Privacy Policy.<br>
