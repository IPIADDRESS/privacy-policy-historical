communicate and disclose and make use of personal information. The following 
outlines our privacy policy. </p>
<ul>
				<li class="style95">Before or at the time of collecting personal 
				information, we will identify the purposes for which information 
				is being collected. </li>
				<li class="style95">We will collect and use of personal 
				information solely with the objective of fulfilling those 
				purposes specified by us and for other compatible purposes, 
				unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as 
				required by law. </li>
				<li class="style95">We will only retain personal information as 
				long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes. </li>
				<li class="style95">We will collect personal information by 
				lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge 
				or consent of the individual concerned. </li>
				<li class="style95">Personal data should be relevant to the 
				purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent 
				necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and 
				up-to-date. </li>

				<li class="style95">Your information is collected via two ways. 
				Firstly, browsing www.sutori.com will create a number of cookies, 
				which are small text files that are downloaded on to your 
				computer’s web browser temporary files. The first two cookies 
				just contain a user identifier (hereinafter “user-id”) and an 
				anonymous session identifier (hereinafter “session-id”), 
				automatically assigned to you by our software. A third cookie 
				will be created once you have browsed topics within 
				www.sutori.com 
				and is used to store which topics have been read, thereby 
				improving your user experience.</li>
				<li class="style95">The second way in which we collect your 
				information is when you submit to us via registration, messages 
				or profile updates.</li>
				<li class="style95">Your account will at a bare minimum contain 
				a uniquely identifiable name (hereinafter “your user name”), a 
				personal password used for logging into your account 
				(hereinafter “your password”) and a personal, valid e-mail 
				address (hereinafter “your e-mail”). Your information for your 
				account at www.sutori.com is protected by data-protection laws 
				applicable in the country that hosts us. Any information beyond 
				your user name, your password, and your e-mail address required 
				by www.sutori.com during the registration process is mandatory. In 
				all cases, you have the option of what information in your 
				account is publicly displayed. Furthermore, within your account, 
				you have the option to opt-in or opt-out of automatically 
				generated e-mails from us.</li>
				<li class="style95">Your password is ciphered (a one-way hash) 
				so that it is secure. However, it is recommended that you do not 
				reuse the same password across a number of different websites. 
				Your password is the means of accessing your account at 
				www.sutori.com, so please guard it carefully. Should you forget your 
				password for your account, you can use the “I forgot my 
				password” feature.</li>
</ul>
<p class="style95">We are committed to conducting our business in accordance 
with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal 
information is protected and maintained. &nbsp;</p>
