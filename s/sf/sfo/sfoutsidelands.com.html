  <div>

    <p><br></p>
   
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">This Privacy Policy.</span><br>
      The Web Site located at <a href="http://www.sfoutsidelands.com/">www.SFOutsidelands.com</a> (the
      “Web Site”) is operated by OSL Group, LLC (hereinafter referred to as “Oustide
      Lands”).&nbsp; This privacy policy describes Outside Lands’ current policies
      and practices with regard to personal data collected by Outside Lands through
      the Web Site. This privacy policy is independent from Outside Lands' offline
      personal data collection practices. The term "personal data" refers to
      personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, birth
      date, e-mail address or mailing address, and any other information that
      is identified with you personally, including your individual health information.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Notification of Changes to This Policy.</span><br>
      Outside Lands is continually improving and adding new functionality and
        features to its Web Site and improving and adding to our existing products,
        services, and programs. Because of these ongoing changes, changes in
        the law, and the changing nature of technology, Outside Lands’ data practices
        will change from time to time. If and when our data practices change,
        Outside Lands will post the changes on the Web Site to notify you of
        the changes. We encourage you to check this page frequently. This policy
      was last updated on May 4, 2012.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Personal Data Collected Through SFOutsideLands.com.</span><br>
      Other than cookies, as described below, the only personal data Outside
        Lands currently collects through its Web Site is the information you
      voluntarily give us when you use our Web Site.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For example, you may use this Web Site to contact Outside Lands with questions

      address, and your mailing address or the mailing address of your company
      or other personal information. If you do not wish to fill out all of the
      information on the form you are not required to do so. You are providing
      any and all such information voluntarily.&nbsp; Most of our registration forms
      require only your name and e-mail address. When you submit information to

      a valid e-mail address. When you use our Web Site to search for information

      us with any personal information. We offer the search features as a service
      to you. Outside Lands does not collect or retain any identifying information
      about you when you use the search features the Web Site.    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Use of Personal Data Collected Through SFOutsideLands.com.</span><br>
      Outside Lands uses the personal data information you provide to answer
        your question or resolve your problem. Outside Lands and our affiliates
        also use this information to help us improve the content and functionality
        of our Web Site, to better understand our customers and markets, and
        to improve our products and services. Outside Lands and our affiliates
        may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about
        products or services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do
        so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting
      you to "unsubscribe' from receiving future communications.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Similarly, we may provide "subscription" e-mail services, either directly
      or through affiliates, which enable you to receive current news and updates
      about the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival. For all such services,
      we will provide an opportunity to "unsubscribe" from, or cancel, the subscription.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Anonymous Data Collected Through SFOutsideLands.com.</span><br>
      In addition to the information you provide when you use www.SFOutsidelands.com,
        Outside Lands uses technology to collect anonymous information about
        the use of our Web Site. For example, we use technology to track how
        many visitors access our Web Site, the date and time of their visit,
        the length of their stay, and which pages they view. We also use technology
        to determine which web browsers our visitors use and the address from
        which they accessed our sites (for example, if they connected to the
      Web Site by clicking on a banner ad).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This technology does not identify you personally. It simply enables us
      to compile statistics about our visitors and their use of the Web Site.
      Outside Lands and our affiliates use this anonymous data and share it with
      third parties to improve the content and functionality of our Web Site,
      to better understand our customers and markets, and to improve our products
      and services.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Cookies.</span><br>
      A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser and
        stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer
        and they cannot be used to discover the identity of a user. You can set
        your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. This enables you
        to decide if you want to accept it or not and whether you are required
        to accept the cookie to view certain content. Outside Lands may use cookies
        to "persist" a user session — that is, to maintain connection with a
        user as he or she moves through an application or series of web pages.
        The purpose of cookies in this context is to remember user inputs. Personalization
        features also use cookies to identify groups of users and deliver appropriate
      content and services.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Disclosure of Your Personal Data.</span><br>
      Outside Lands may share some or all of the personal data collected through
        the Web Site with our affiliates, who use this data in accordance with
        this Privacy Policy. Both Outside Lands and our affiliates may share
        personal data collected with third-party vendors who act for or on behalf
        of Outside Lands or our affiliates (for example, companies that provide
        support services to us, including data processing services, or that help
        us market our products and services). These companies may need information
        about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not
        authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose.
        In addition, there may be some other, limited circumstances in which
        Outside Lands or our affiliates may share or transfer the personal data
        in our databases, for example, to comply with a legal requirement, for
        the administration of justice, to protect your vital interests, or in
        the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, or
      similar event.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While no method of data transmission is guaranteed against unlawful third
      party interception or other misuse, Outside Lands uses commercially reasonable
      efforts to ensure protection of your data including industry-standard encryption
      and offline security methods in our physical facilities.    </p>
