<h1>SF Station Privacy Policy</h1>
<div class="blurb">
<p>This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") governs the use and collection of information from you by SF Station's products, software, services and websites (referred to collectively as the "Services" in this document). This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other information you may provide us through other means (e.g., via mail, via telephone or at a live event).</p>
<p>This SF Station Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information you submit to us through our Services. This includes "Personal Information," which is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, email address, user ID number, and other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing, as well as "Anonymous Information," which is information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information and does not permit the identification of individual persons.</p>
<h1>1. User Consent</h1>
<p>By accessing or otherwise using the Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into and forms a part of the SF Station <a href="http://www.sfstation.com/legal/terms.php">Terms of Service</a>. You expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information and Anonymous Information according to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Your Personal Information may be processed and stored in other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. Your Personal Information will not, however, be used or disclosed for purposes for which you have not given consent or which are not permitted under applicable law.</p>
<p>Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the Services and we do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Information from those who are under 13 years old. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information permanently from our databases. We recommend that children between the ages of 13 and 18 obtain their parent's permission before submitting information over the internet. By using the Services, you are representing that you are at least 18 years old, or that you are at least 13 years old and have a parent's or guardian's permission to use the Services.</p>
<h1>2. Information Collected</h1>
<p><b>Traffic Data Collected</b></p>
<p>Like most web sites, our servers automatically track and collect some or all of the following information when you visit our Website, including: (i) your IP address, (ii) your domain server, (iii) the URL being requested, (iv) the referring URL, (v) your type of computer, (vi) the browser type and operating system used to make the request, (vii) the date and time of the request, and (viii) source of any link (collectively, "Traffic Data"). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for marketing purposes or for improving your experience on the Services. Our Services use Traffic Data to help diagnose potential problems with our servers, to administer our Services and to report and collect aggregate non-personal information. We do not associate Traffic Data with records containing personal information and cannot use Traffic Data to retrieve personal information from your computer.</p>
<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
<p>Our Websites use cookies to track individual site usage. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your internet browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are used to help target ads on the site based on user behavior and cookies also remember deliberate action taken by the user on our Websites, such as logging into the Services. For example, our Services uses cookies to ensure that you don't see the same ad repeatedly. You, through your browser preferences if your browser so permits, are free to decline our cookies, but in doing so may be excluded from some of our Services' features. We therefore recommend, in order to maximize your user experience in regard to our websites, products and services, that you leave your browser preferences set to accept cookies.</p>
<p><b>Personal Information Collected</b></p>
<p>Our Services may require registration for the use of certain features, products or services, and such registration forms request that you provide us with information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Personal Information we request includes some or all of the following: (i) your name, (ii) address, (iii) telephone number, (iv) gender, (v) birthdate, (vi) e-mail address, (vii) demographic information, and (viii) any other Personal Information that you may voluntarily provide to us but are not required to. We also provide you with the opportunity to advise you of site and newsletter preferences. If you communicate with us by email or complete online forms, any Personal Information provided in such communication may be collected by us.</p>
<p>We collect information in the form of the content that you submit during your use of the Services, such as photos, videos, reviews, ratings and other information you choose to submit. We may also collect information about you and your friends who use the Services, from any social network you may have connected from, in order to provide you with a more personalized experience. For instance, we may collect your user ID or profile information that you have permitted to be displayed through our Services in order to display you as a friend or in association with your profile and collections. When you purchase a Deal, you will need to submit your credit card or other payment information so that our service providers can process your payment for the Deal. When you sign up for, or win, any Giveaway, contests, sweepstakes, or other activities that we make available on the Services, we will collect the information designated along with such activity, which may include your contact information such as your address and phone number. If you choose to sign up to receive information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we will collect your email address and other related information. Additionally, we collect any information that you voluntarily enter, including Personal Information, into any postings, comments, or forums within the Services.</p>
<p><b>Personal Information From Other Sources</b></p>
<p>We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources with which you have registered, companies who we have partnered with (collectively, "Partners") or other third parties. We may associate this information with the other Personal Information we have collected about you.</p>
<p><b>Email And Email Addresses</b></p>
<p>If you send an email to us, or fill out our contact or feedback form through our Services, we will collect your email address and the full content of your email, including attached files, and other information you provide. We may use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through our Services or the social network from which you have connected to our Services (such as in an invitation, or when sharing your content). Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message) or notifications from a social network or other website with whom you have registered to receive such notifications. We may use this email address to contact you, for things such as notifications of special offers, Deals, Giveaways and other related information. You may indicate your preference to stop receiving further promotional communications as further detailed below.</p>
<h1>3. Sharing of Personal Information</h1>
<p>We do not share Personal Information with advertisers or any other third parties, except in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<p><b>Consent</b></p>
<p>In the event and to the extent we have your consent. In such cases, we will provide opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</p>
<p><b>Affiliated or Trusted Persons</b></p>
<p>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, partners, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We occasionally utilize trusted third parties to perform certain functions on our behalf. These authorized third parties may be given access to Personal Information in order to perform their designated function but are contractually bound to maintain the confidentiality and security of the Personal Information. Examples of such services include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments (including credit card payments), and providing customer service. We require our third-party service providers to promise not to use such information except as necessary to provide the relevant services to us. Furthermore, such third parties are restricted from using or in any way altering data other than in accordance with their expressed contractual function.</p>
<p><b>Deals, Giveaways, Contests, Coupons and Surveys</b></p>
<p>We may share data collected through Deals, Giveaways, Contests, Coupons and Surveys with our divisions, subsidiaries, partners, and affiliated companies. This will only apply to users who choose to participate in such Deals, Giveaways, Contests, Coupons and Surveys. We may share some or all of your Personal Information (other than credit card information) with Merchants whose Deals you have purchased for their commercial purposes and to provision the Deal. If you do not want us to use or disclose Personal Information collected about you in the manner identified in this Privacy Policy, you may not use our Services.</p>
<p><b>Enforcement or Protection</b></p>
<p>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of us, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of ours or that acquirer's assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect and defend our rights or property, you, or third parties. You hereby consent to us sharing your Personal Information under the circumstances described herein.</p>
<h1>4. Uses of Information Collected</h1>
<p><b>Generally</b></p>
<p>We use your Personal Information to send you information about our company or our products or services, to respond to any inquiries you may make with us, or to contact you when necessary.
