    </div>
</div>
<div class="contentbody clearfix">
  <div class="column1">
  <div class="content">

<p>This Privacy Policy governs your use of this web site and any content made
available from or through this web site located at <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/">www.sfgate.com</a>, including any subdomains
thereof (the "Web Site"). The Web Site is made available by San Francisco
Chronicle, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc. ("Newspaper" or "we" or
"us").</p>

<p>By visiting this Web Site or using the services offered on or through this
Web Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, as they may be amended
from time to time. As we update and expand our Web Site and services, this
Privacy Policy may change, so check back to this page from time to time. This
Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and part of, the Newspaper Web Site Terms
and Conditions of Use located at <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/pages/termsandconditions/">www.sfgate.com/pages/termsandconditions/</a>
(the "Terms of Use"), which governs your use of
this Web Site in general.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you may provide to us,
or that we may obtain, other than through our Web Site, such as by phone,
through postal mail and through other offline and print mediums. This Privacy
Policy does not apply to information collected about you by anyone except us and
only applies to the Web Site to which this policy is linked.</p>

<p>This Web Site is intended for users who are located in the United States of
America. This Privacy Policy shall be interpreted under the laws of the United
States.</p>

<p><b>A. Purpose</b></p>

<p>In order to make your visits to our Web Site and use of the services
available on or through our Web Site as worthwhile as possible, we may ask you
for Personal Information and we may collect certain information from your
computer each time you visit us. "Personal Information" includes, for
example, your name; home address; business address; e-mail address; telephone,
wireless or fax number; short message service or text message address or other
wireless device address; instant messaging address; credit card and other
payment information; demographic information and other information that may
identify you as an individual or allow online or offline contact with you as an
individual. From time to time, other information, such as your age, gender,
education and subscription information may also be requested. This Privacy
Policy explains, in general, what Personal Information and other information is
collected on our Web Site, how the information is used, and with whom we may
share such information. California and Canadian residents have the right to know
how their information may be shared with third parties who engage in direct
marketing activities and this Privacy Policy explains our practices and how you
can opt-out of having your information shared for such purposes. Please take a
few minutes to read our Privacy Policy so that you understand how we treat your
information.</p>

<p><b>B. What Information is Collected on this Web Site?</b></p>

<p><b>1. User-Provided Information</b></p>

<p>We collect two types of personally identifying information from users:
personal data (such as names and contact details) and aggregated data (such as
information about traffic patterns on the Web Site, for example, how many users
log onto the Web Site on a daily basis). We collect personal information from
users of our Web Site, for example, through such users' activities, transactions
and completion of online forms on our Web Site. Such information is collected,
for example, when users register or subscribe for accounts or features on our
Web Site, make online purchases, enter sweepstakes and contests, complete
surveys, contribute to a chat room, bulletin board, list serve, blog, wiki or
other open forum that we may make available on or through our Web Site, submit a
comment or question to us using a "contact us" or similar feature on our Web
Site, send us an e-mail, or in any other way submit personal information to us
via our Web Site.</p>

<p>You may be able to send information about our products and services to your
friends and family members through our Web Site by clicking on an "E-mail to
Friend" or similar button on our Web Site or in an e-mail that we have sent you.
In some of these cases (unless you simply forward our e-mail on your own), you
may provide the name and e-mail address of your friend or family member to us.
Such information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy and
applicable law.</p>

<p>You may also be able to send an online card to a friend or family member, or
send them a gift or gift certificate. If so, you may be required to provide us
with your friend's or family member's Personal Information. Such information
will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>

<p><b>2. Web Site Usage Information</b></p>

<p><b>(i) Cookies</b></p>

<p>We may use "cookies" to keep, and sometimes track, information about you.
Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software
from a Web server when you visit it and are stored on your computer's hard drive
for record keeping purposes. Cookies track where you travel on our Web Site and
what you look at and purchase. &nbsp;They may store the information in your
shopping cart, and/or your username and password. A cookie may enable us to
relate your use of our Web Site to other information about you, including your
Personal Information. These purposes serve to improve and personalize your
experience on our Web Site.</p>

<p>You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in
the internet industry. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are
not subject to our privacy policies.</p>

<p>Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you
and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you
have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to
reject or delete Flash cookies. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases,
preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the
Web Site or certain areas or features of the Web Site.</p>

<p><b>(ii) Clear GIFs</b></p>

<p>We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar
technologies, in the Web Site and in our communications with you to enable us to
know whether you have visited a web page or received a message. A clear GIF is
typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as
well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is
retrieved from a remote site on the internet enabling the verification of an
individual's viewing or receipt of a web page or message. A clear GIF may enable
us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other
information about you, including your Personal Information.</p>

<p><b>(iii) IP Address and Clickstream Data</b></p>

<p>Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit and
information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or Web Site
registrations, is collected through various methods. For example, our server may
automatically collect data about your server's internet address when you visit
us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a
number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your internet service
provider whenever you're on the internet. When you request pages from our Web
Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our
server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another
web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Web Site; the web site
you visit after this Web Site; the ads you see; the ads you click on; other
information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software
and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Web Site
or a referral site; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web
servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help
diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web Site. Such
information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as
country of origin and internet service provider. We may also link this
information with your Personal Information when we feel that it is necessary to
enforce compliance with our rules and policies or Terms of Use or to protect our
Web Site, customers or others.</p>

<p>Any or all of these activities with regard to Web Site usage information may
be performed on our behalf by our services providers.</p>

<p><b>C. How is the Personal Information Used?</b></p>

<p>We use both personal and aggregated information we collect for multiple
purposes. The Personal Information may be used to improve the content of the Web
Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Web Site for each individual
user, and to notify users about updates to the Web Site or promotional offers or
opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you. We will use the
Personal Information you provide to our Web Site, for example, to respond to
your requests and to provide you with our product and service offerings. For
example, we will process your orders, respond to your requests and inquiries and
provide you with the services and features offered on or through our Web Site.
We may also use your Personal Information to maintain our internal record
keeping. We may also report information about your account to credit bureaus.
Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be
reflected in your credit report. We may match information collected from you
through different means or at different times, including both Personal
Information and Web Site usage information, and use such information along with
information obtained from other sources, including third parties. In addition,
we may send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the
like), and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies
and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you. You
may opt-out of receiving such notices from us, at any time, by following the
instructions in the <a href="#optout">Right to Opt-out</a> section below.</p>

<p>We may analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Web
Site and e-mails, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate. We may also
use information provided to us on an anonymous aggregated basis for purposes of
analyzing traffic and usage patterns.</p>

<p>In addition, we may use information you provide us through e-mails, Q &amp;
A, and in response to polls for editorial purposes, and may use your name and
any stories you provide us in articles published online and in our newspaper.
Please be advised that any such submissions may be used by us for any lawful
purpose. If you provide us with personal anecdotes, they may be attributed to
you and we may include your user name and any personal information that you
provide in an open forum on this Web Site, as provided in section D(i) below, to
facilitate such attribution. We can edit, rewrite, use, and reuse the content,
including your name, likeness, photograph, and biographical information you
provide, in any way and any media whether now known or invented in the future,
with or without attribution, including publication in our newspaper, and in
trade media, and advertising and promotions. You agree that any content you send
will comply with the Terms of Use.</p>

<p><b>D. Do we Share Personal Information and Web Site Usage Information with
Others?</b></p>

<p><b>(i) Public Forums</b></p>

<p>When you contribute to a public area or feature of our Web Site, such as a
chat room, bulletin board, list serve, blog, wiki or other open forum that we
may make available on or through our Web Site, the information that you submit
will be made available to the general public and will not be considered
"Personal Information" for purposes of this Privacy Policy. For this reason, we
recommend that you do not submit any sensitive information, including your full
name, home address, phone number, other information that would enable other
users to locate you or your financial information on these areas of our Web
Site. Instead, make up a username that does not disclose your personal
identity.</p>

<p><b>(ii) Third Party Offers</b></p>

<p>We reserve the right to make our customer lists available to companies or
other entities not affiliated with the Newspaper that have goods, services and
offers that we believe might be of interest to you. We may compile these lists
from customer orders placed both offline and online. We may, from time to time,
provide your Personal Information to these entities so that they may send you
these offers. Customers have the option of having their names and identifying
information removed from those lists (subject to certain exceptions and
limitations in applicable laws) by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sfgate.com">privacy@sfgate.com</a>, or calling the
following telephone number: 415-777-6333.</p>

<p><b>(iii) Co-sponsored Contests, Sweepstakes and Offerings</b></p>

<p>Some of our contests, sweepstakes and other offerings may be co-sponsored by
another company. In those situations, the information we obtain from you in
connection with such contest, sweepstakes or offering may be shared with our
co-sponsor. In those situations, our co-sponsors will have the right to use your
information for their own purposes, in accordance with their own policies. If
you do not wish for the information we obtain from you to be shared with our
co-sponsor, then do not enter such contest, sweepstake or other offering or
otherwise provide to us any Personal Information in connection with such
contest, sweepstake or other offering. We are not responsible for how our
co-sponsors may use your information.</p>

<p><b>(iv) Service Providers</b></p>

<p>We may use third parties to help operate our Web Site and deliver our
products and services, and may share your Personal Information with our
affiliates, service providers and other third parties that provide products or
services for or through this Web Site or for our business (such as Web Site or
database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service
providers, analytics companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies,
and other similar service providers that use such information on our behalf).
Unless otherwise stated, these companies do not have any right to use the
Personal Information we provide to them beyond what is necessary for them to
assist us. We may use third parties to provide services in connection with
Submitted Materials, as that term is defined in the Terms of Use. In accordance
with section D(i) above, information in forums, information submitted for
sweepstakes or other offerings, and Submitted Materials (including submitted
video and pictures), become publicly available and may be used by us for any
lawful purpose. We may share personal information that is included with
Submitted Materials with third parties, including, without limitation, vendors
or other service providers, affiliates and partners.</p>

<p>When you conduct e-commerce with one of the e-commerce affiliates or service
providers to which the Web Site may be linked, certain personal information such
as your e-mail and home address may be collected by the service provider's
server and made available to us. We do not, however, transfer credit card
information you may provide to that service provider.</p>

<p><b>(v) Aggregate Statistics</b></p>

<p>We may disclose aggregate statistics regarding user behavior as a measure of
interest in, and use of, our Web Site and e-mails to third parties in the form
of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not
describe or identify any individual user.</p>

<p><b>(vi) Legally Compelled Disclosures</b></p>

<p>We may disclose Personal Information to government authorities, and to other
third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at our
discretion, or otherwise as required or permitted by law, including but not
limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas. We also may disclose
Personal Information when we have reason to believe that someone has committed,
or will commit, unlawful acts or acts that endanger the health or safety of
another; is causing injury to, or interference with, our rights or property,
other users of the Web Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such
activities. In some situations, we may share your Personal Information, on a
confidential basis, with third parties who perform a particular service on our
behalf, such as sending e-mails.</p>

<p><b>(vii) Business Transfer</b></p>

<p>In the event that the Newspaper, any affiliate of the Newspaper, or
substantially all of its assets, are acquired by one or more third parties as a
result of an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or
liquidation, Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets. For
purposes of this policy, an "affiliate" of the Newspaper is an entity that is
under the control of, or under common control with, the Newspaper (and for these
purposes, a company controlling twenty 20% percent or more of the voting stock
of another entity shall be deemed to control such entity).</p>

<p><b><a name="thirdPartyAds">(viii) Third Party Ad Servers</a></b></p>
<p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our
Web Site. If so, a list of these ad serving companies will be available here.
These companies may use information (generally, not including your name,
address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to this Web Site
and to other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and
services of interest to you. These companies may employ cookies and clear GIFs
to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties
collect via cookies and clear GIFs is generally not personally identifiable
(unless, for example, you provide personally identifiable information to them
through an ad or e-mail message). We encourage you to read these businesses'
privacy policies if you should have any concerns about how they will care for
your personal information. If you would like more information about this
practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by
these companies, see the Network Advertising Initiative's consumer web site at
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/">www.networkadvertising
.org/consumer/</a>.</p>

<p>Yahoo! is an ad network partner that displays ads on our Web Site. To improve
your ad experience on our Web Site and elsewhere on the Internet, we may send
non-personal information to Yahoo! based on your browser's activities, such as
type of pages viewed and categories of interests, so that the advertising you
see is relevant to you. Yahoo! also may use information regarding its own users
to select which ads to display. Click <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/opt_out/targeting/details.html">
here</a> to learn more about Yahoo!'s ad practices, including how to opt out of
using anonymous information to select which ads to show you.</p>

<p><b><a name="optout">E. Right to Opt-out</a></b></p>

<p>You have the right to "opt-out" of certain of our uses of your Personal
Information. For example, at the time you are requested to provide Personal
Information on this Web Site, you may have the opportunity to elect to, or not
to: (1) receive correspondence from us, or (2) have your Personal Information
shared with other entities affiliated or unaffiliated with the Newspaper for
their marketing purposes. You may also make this request by calling 415-777-6333
or by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@sfgate.com">privacy@sfgate.com</a> and indicating that you
opt not to receive any marketing correspondence from us or from affiliated and
unaffiliated entities. In this e-mail, please indicate whether you would like to
opt-out of (i) receiving any correspondence from us or from entities affiliated
with us or unaffiliated third parties for their marketing purposes; or (ii)
(selectively identify opt-out options, eg., receipt of promotional
correspondence, e-newsletters or correspondence, sharing of Personal Information
with entities affiliated with you for their marketing purposes, sharing of
Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties for their marketing
purposes, etc.) You may also opt-out of the Newspaper's promotional e-mails by
clicking on an opt-out link within the e-mail you receive <b>,</b> or opt-out of
the Newspaper's SMS messages by texting STOP to 744559.</p>

<p>Please understand that if you opt-out of receiving correspondence from us, we
may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities,
transactions and communications with us. Also, a request to have us stop sharing
your Personal Information with other entities for marketing purposes will apply
as of the date that is ten (10) business days after our receipt of your request,
and we will not be responsible for any communications that you may receive from
entities that received your Personal Information prior to such request. In these
cases, please contact that entity directly.</p>

<p><b>F. Security</b></p>

<p><b>1. General</b></p>

<p>No transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely
secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of the
Newspaper to intercept or access transmissions or private communications
unlawfully, including in the case of your contacting us by e-mail or a "contact
us" or similar feature on our Web Site. Accordingly, though the Newspaper may
take reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all Personal
Information provided to this Web Site, due to the inherent nature of the
internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that
information, during transmission through the internet or while stored on our
system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by
others, such as hackers. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.</p>

<p>You may be able to create an account on our Web Site with a username and
password. If so, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality
of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any access to or use
of the Web Site by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or
not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether
or not such person or entity is your employee or agent. You agree to (a)
immediately notify the Newspaper of any unauthorized use of your password or
account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your
account at the end of each session. It is your sole responsibility to control
the dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your
account, and notify the Newspaper when you desire to cancel your account on this
Web Site. We will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising
from your failure to comply with this provision.</p>

<p>We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or
unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal
Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek
to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would
endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the
extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail or by other
means as required by law. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such
notification.</p>

<p><b>2. Phishing</b></p>

<p>With identity theft a continuing problem, it has become increasingly common
for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers, purporting to
represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line merchant, requesting
that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information. Sometimes, the
domain name of the e-mail address from which the e-mail appears to have been
sent, and the domain name of the web site requesting such information, appears
to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted company. In reality, such
sensitive information may be collected by an unauthorized individual to be used
for purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity has come to be known as
"phishing."</p>

<p>If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide
any sensitive information (including your Web Site password or credit card
information) via e-mail or to a web site that does not seem to be affiliated
with our Web Site, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not
provide such information, and report such request to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sfgate.com">privacy@sfgate.com</a>.</p>

<p><b>G.</b> <b>Children</b></p>

<p>The Web Site is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 or for
children between the ages of 13 and 17, except in accordance with the Terms of
Use. No one under age 13 is authorized to provide any Personal Information or
use our public discussion areas, forums and chat rooms. The Newspaper does not
knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13.</p>

<p><b>H. Wireless Addresses</b></p>

<p>If the e-mail address you provide to us is a wireless e-mail address, you
agree to receive messages at such address from the Newspaper or entities
affiliated with the Newspaper (unless and until you have elected not to receive
such messages by following the instructions in the <a href="#optout">Right to Opt-out</a>
section above). You understand that your wireless carrier's standard rates apply
to these messages, and that you may change your mind at any time by following
the instructions in the <a href="#optout">Right to Opt-out</a> section above. <b>&nbsp;</b> You
represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device on
which messages will be received, and that you are authorized to approve the
applicable charges.</p>

<p><b>I. Short Message Service</b></p>

<p>We may make available a service through which you can receive messages on
your wireless device via short message service ("SMS Service"). If you subscribe
to one of our SMS Services, you thereby agree to receive SMS Service messages at
the address you provide for such purposes. Such messages may come from the
Newspaper or the rest of the affiliates of the Newspaper (unless and until you
have elected not to receive such messages by following the instructions in the
<a href="#optout">Right to Opt-out</a> section above).</p>

<p>You understand that your wireless carrier's standard rates apply to these
messages, and that you may change your mind at any time by following the
instructions in the <a href="#optout">Right to Opt-out</a> section above. You represent that
you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device you use to sign up
for the SMS Service, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable
charges. To use the SMS Service, you must be 18 years of age or older and reside
in the United States. You must first register and provide all required Personal
Information, which may include, for example, your name, SMS address, wireless
carrier and, if fees are applicable to the SMS Service you subscribe to, billing
information (either your credit card information or mobile service carrier
information if applicable fees will be billed through your carrier). We may also
obtain the date, time and content of your messages in the course of your use of
the SMS Service. We will use the information we obtain in connection with our
SMS Service in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If fees are charged to your
wireless account invoice, we may provide your carrier with your applicable
information in connection therewith. Your wireless carrier and other service
providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their
practices are governed by their own policies.</p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via wireless
systems which use radios (and other means) to transmit communications over
complex networks. We do not guarantee that your use of the SMS Service will be
private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or
security you may experience. You are fully responsible for taking precautions
and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use
of the SMS Service. We may also access the content of your account and wireless
account with your carrier for the purpose of identifying and resolving technical
problems and service-related complaints.</p>

<p>By signing up for the SMS Service, you consent to receive, from time to time,
further messages which may include news, promotions and offers from us, our
affiliates and partners, and, unless and until you have opted-out of these
activities by following the instructions in the <a href="#optout">Right to Opt-out</a> section
above. Please follow the instructions provided to you by third parties to
unsubscribe from their messages.</p>

not responsible for the information practices of these web sites. This Privacy
Policy does not address the information practices of those other web sites. The
privacy policies of web sites operated by other affiliates of the Newspaper are
located on those web sites.</p>
