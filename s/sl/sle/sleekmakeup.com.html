A 'Cookie' is a file in your web browser that enables us to recognise your computer when you visit the site and make using our website quicker and easier (e.g. login fields may be pre-filled with your email address). Cookies are also essential to the functioning of certain parts of the site and we use them to collect information about how the site is used, such as how many people visit and return and what products are being viewed. We may also use Cookies for marketing and to give you a more personalised experience on our website.

The information is aggregated so it does not identify individuals, and we use it only to help us improve the way the website works.</p></li><p></p><li><strong>Enabling the features of the website:</strong><p>We may use Cookies that allow our website to remember choices you have made, such as your user name, and help us provide you with a better, more personal experience. For example, they may allow you to watch a video clip, comment on a blog or add a product review.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><p></p><li><strong>Marketing and advertising:</strong><p>We may use Cookies to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you, as well as to limit the number of times you see a particular advertisement and to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.

By default, Cookies should be enabled on your computer or device, and although you can ‘disable’ them in your browser this will affect your experience on the website. You will be limited to browsing, viewing and searching for products but may not be able to take additional actions on our site or log in to your account.</p><p>If you'd still prefer to restrict, block or delete Cookies from this or any other website, you may do so in your internet browser.
