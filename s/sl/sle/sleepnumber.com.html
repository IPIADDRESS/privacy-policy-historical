            content to replace medical care, medical diagnosis, or the relationship between You and Your physician or
            other medical provider. We are not a licensed medical care provider and have no expertise in diagnosing,
            examining, or treating medical conditions of any kind. The data generated by and through the Services or
            Your Bed (<span class="text-weight-heavy">“Data”</span>) should not be used in any way to diagnose or treat any medical condition. You should
            always consult with a physician or healthcare professional regarding any concerns You have relating to Your
            health, especially before You start or stop any particular health-related regimen. Never delay seeking or
            disregard professional medical advice because of something You have read or interpreted while using the
            Services or the Bed, or based on any Data.</p>
          <p>Through Your use of the Services and/or the Bed, You may have access to certain biometric and sleep-related
            data regarding You and any person that uses Your Bed. We do not provide the Data in real time and the Data
            is not an equivalent or substitute for medical or scientific sleep monitoring analysis or techniques used by
            sleep doctors and scientists, such as polysomnography and actigraphy. In some cases, the Data is generated
            by averaging, correlating, or otherwise manipulating raw data being captured and transmitted to Your Bed. We
            intend the Data to be informational only and You should not use the Data as a substitute for medical care or
            diagnosis, including, without limitation, the proper supervision of either a medical condition or person.
            For example, nobody should use the Services to monitor a person of limited mobility or who is at risk of a
            fall to ensure that they remain in bed, or to monitor someone with sleep apnea to ensure they are breathing.
            We undertake no responsibility or liability with respect to use of the Data to ensure Your or any other
            person’s health or safety. You acknowledge and agree that the Services and the Bed do not protect Your or
            any other person’s health or safety. If You rely on information provided by the Services or the Bed, You do
            so solely at Your own risk.</p>
          <p>To access certain features of Our Services, We may require the use of encryption technologies provided for
            Your protection. We use reasonable precautions to protect the privacy of Your username, password, Sleep
            Number account, and User Profile information and to ensure that information collected through the Services
            is not lost, misused or altered inappropriately by administering security measures. You are ultimately
            responsible for protecting Your username, password, Sleep Number account, and User Profile information from
            disclosure to third parties, and You are not permitted to circumvent the use of required encryption
            technologies. You agree to immediately notify Us of any unauthorized use of Your username, password, Sleep
            Number account, and/or User Profile, and/or any other breach of security.</p>
