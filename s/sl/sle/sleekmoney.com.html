This policy applies only to personal information given by you and collected by us on our sites.

<p><strong>What kind of information do we collect at SleekFly?</strong><br>
  Personal information that is relevant to the use and purpose and enjoyment of our websites, which in part is to enable users to share information with one another. This information allows us to provide you with a customized, unique and efficient site/experience. We collect the following types of information from our SleekFly users:<br>
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Information you provide to us: </strong><br>
    We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special site features such as writing articles, posting comments, posting images and videos to our websites, creating a user profile or receiving E-mail alerts.</p>
  <p><strong>Registration and user profile:<br>
  </strong> In order for you to use certain SleekFly services, you must complete a registration form. As part of this registration process, we require certain personal information (including your name, city, state and e-mail address). We also allow you to provide additional information, such as your bio, favorite URLs and other info. In addition, you may choose to include photos of yourself in your profile. You can control how your information is displayed and used by what you enter or omit. The personal information you provide to us is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, customizing the advertising content you see and communicating with you.</p>
  <p><strong>Website use:</strong><br> 
  When you use our websites, you may, among other things, set up your profile, form relationships with others, send messages, perform searches and queries, create articles, comment and transmit information through various channels. In most cases, we retain your information so that you can return to view saved information or sent messages. When you update your information, we usually keep a back-up copy of the prior version. We collect this information in order to provide you with our services and offer you a more personalized and relevant experience on our websites.</p>
  <p><strong>You post information at your own risk:<br>
  </strong> Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on our websites will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on our websites. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your information may remain viewable in cached, archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your information.</p>
  <p><strong>Optional voluntary information: <br>
    </strong>In order to access or use certain services and capabilities on our Site, you may be required to voluntarily submit certain Personal Information. The use of these services or capabilities is purely optional, so you are not required to submit any Personal Information to us if you do not wish to use them. </p>
  <p><strong>Usage tracking: </strong><br>
    SleekFly may track user traffic patterns and content accessed throughout our Site. However, we don’t typically combine this information with data about individual users. SleekFly may sometimes track and catalog the search terms users of our Site enter in our search function, but this tracking is not associated with individual users. This information allows us to better tailor our content to users needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand our audience.<br>
    E-mail alerts: In order to receive an E-mail alert every time you post a new article on one of our websites, you are required to submit your E-mail address. </p>
  <p><strong>Automatic Information: <br>
  </strong>We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. SleekFly and its authorized agents automatically receive and record traffic data on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, SleekFly cookie information, and the page you requested. SleekFly uses this traffic data to help diagnose issues with our servers, analyze trends and maintain our websites.</p>
  <p><strong><br>
    Information sent to us by your web browser: </strong><br>
    We may collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser, such as your IP address, the address of the web page you were visiting when you accessed our web sites, information on your operating system and browser, and the date and time of your visit. Such information does not by itself identify you personally. However, if you have registered on our sites, it may be possible for us to link the information provided by your browser to information that identifies you personally. In addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect wrong intent or potential criminal activity, we might share our server logs -- which contain visitors’ IP addresses -- with the appropriate investigative authorities that could use the information to trace and identify individuals.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>General information: <br>
    </strong>Our service may automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our websites and its components. This data is only used in the aggregate, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of our websites, so we can make our websites appealing to as many users as possible. In addition, we may provide statistical information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our websites. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their areas and our websites, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal experience. We also collect and use this information for internal purposes. For example, if you are a registered user of the SleekFly E-mail and/or subscription based services, we may keep records in your account history of your complaints about other registered users online behavior, and any reported violation of our Terms of Service policy that you or someone on your account may have committed. <br>
    E-mail confirmation: We may receive a confirmation when you open an E-mail from SleekFly, if your computer supports this type of program, in order to help us make E-mails more interesting and helpful. We may also send out e-mails with news, contests or promotions. If you do not want to receive E-mail or other mail from us, please notify us by E-mail at <a href="mailto:admin@SleekFly.com">admin@SleekFly.com</a> and be sure to identify your account.</p>

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.<br>
  We restrict access to personal information to SleekFly employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. Only authorized individuals have access to the personal information provided by our websites users. For example, employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (ie…., a customer service representative or technical consultant) are granted access to it. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.<br>
  We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using your computer or a shared computer. SleekFly uses secure data networks protected by firewall and password protection systems. Our Privacy Policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Ways to Control, Change or Display my Information</strong></p>
<p>We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use and disclose your personal information. You can access your personal information on our websites and correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate. In order to do so, login to your account to view and edit your profile, then edit and update your information, as needed. </p>
<p>When you update or change your profile or if you edit/delete information, we will still maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. When you update information, you can always choose not to disclose information, but then you may be unable to use certain features on our websites. You can request deletion of your SleekFly account by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:admin@SleekFly.com">admin@SleekFly.com</a> </p>
<p>If you do not wish to receive e-mail from us or other SleekFly users, please visit your user profile and/or follow the instructions to eliminate e-mail messages. Please note that you will continue to receive all system e-mails (ie... those regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (ie... updates to our policies) from us.</p>
<p><strong>What Choices Do I Have? </strong><br>
  When you sign up for a particular service or area of interest that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your permission prior to such use. You can always choose not to disclose information, but then you may be unable to use certain features on our websites.<br>
  As explained earlier, the help section on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. But once again, if your browser does not accept cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of some of our features and services.<br>
If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in other specific service privacy notices, we will offer you a way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use your information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy without informing you first. </p>
