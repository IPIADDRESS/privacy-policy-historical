<p lang="en"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;Geeknet, Inc. (“Geeknet”), comprised of the Internet sites Geek.net, Sourceforge.net, Slashdot.org, ThinkGeek.com, feedery.com, and freshmeat.net (the “Sites”), is committed to protecting the privacy of users of the Sites. Geeknet intends to give users as much control as possible over user’s personally identifiable information, including registration data. This Privacy Statement applies to each of the Sites and describes the information Geeknet collects about users and how that information may be used.</span></span></p>
<p lang="en"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Geeknet reserves the right to update and change this Privacy Statement from time to time. If Geeknet makes material changes to its privacy practices, a prominent notice will be posted on this web page. Each time a user uses the Sites, the current version of the Privacy Statement applies. Accordingly, a user should check the date of this Privacy Statement (which appears at the top) and review for any changes since the last version. If a user does not agree to the Privacy Statement, the user should not use the Sites.</span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en"><span style="font-size: medium;"><a name="notice"></a> <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>NOTICE</strong></span></span></p>
<p lang="en"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Geeknet provides this Privacy Statement to make users aware of Geeknet privacy practices, and of the choices a user may make about the way the user’s information is collected and used.</span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Children</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Users represent they are of legal age to create binding and financial obligations for any liability users may incur as a result of their use of the Sites. The Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13, and Geeknet will never request personally identifiable information from anyone whom it knows to be under the age of 13 without verifiable parental or guardian consent. Geeknet does not knowingly collect, or wish to obtain, personally identifiable information from children. If Geeknet becomes aware that a user is under the age of 13 and has provided personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental or guardian consent, it will remove user’s personally identifiable information from its files.</span></span></span></p>

<p lang="en"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Geeknet may collect two types of information from users of Sites: "personally identifiable information" (such as name, email address, postal address, telephone, birth date) and "aggregate information" (such as frequency of visits to Sites, IP address, Site pages most frequently accessed, browser type). Personally identifiable information is any piece of information which can potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate a user of the Sites. Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about users of the Sites. Aggregate information is used in a collective manner and no single person can be identified by that compiled information.</span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">On the Sites, users may order products or services, and register to receive materials. Personally identifiable information collected on the Sites includes community forum content, diaries, profiles, photographs, name, unique identifiers (e.g., passwords), contact and billing information (e.g., email address, postal address, telephone, fax), and transaction information.</span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In order to tailor Geeknet’s subsequent communications to users and continuously improve the Sites’ products and services, Geeknet may also ask users to provide information regarding their interests, demographics, experience with its products, and detailed contact preferences.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span lang="en">Geeknet uses web beacons from time to time. Such web beacons may be provided by Geeknet’s third party advertising companies to help manage and optimize Geeknet’s online advertising.

A web beacon is a string of code that provides a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data, or determining how many times a specific web page has been viewed. Web beacons enable Geeknet to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits a Site, and to learn which banner ads bring users to each Site. For example, when a user visits a web page, the code for the page may include instructions to go to another server to gather a single pixel graphic image. Web beacons are not placed on a user’s computer, and users remain anonymous.</span></span></span></p>
