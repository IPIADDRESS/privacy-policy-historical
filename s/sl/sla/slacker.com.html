                    <h2 class="sub_heading">What kind of information do we collect?</h2>
                    <p>
We collect a variety of information for a variety of purposes. We collect personal information, such as your name and email address during your visit to the Slacker Website, in connection with various events such as, but not limited to, sweepstakes or contest entry, or subscribing to receive a Slacker newsletter. Submission of personal information through the Website is voluntary in most cases and will be collected once you submit it to the Website. If you download software, your name and email information will be required. However, to use any aspect of the Slacker Service, you may be required to register and provide certain information including a member or user name, a password, a valid email address (together the “Account Information”) or a credit card.  We do not collect personal information from children who we know to be under the age of 13. We also collect demographic information by a number of ways. We keep track of the domains from which people visit our Website. For legal and business reasons, we may track the country or zip code of the visitor. We analyze this data for trends and statistics, and for federal export law compliance when required. This information is analyzed at an aggregate level. Finally, we collect statistical browser information on the anonymous users of our Website, including: (1) the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user's computer, (2) the referring URL, if any, or (3) the browser software identification (this provides the brand and version of the browser software used by the anonymous user while viewing our Website). This is not personally identifiable information.

                    <h2 class="sub_heading">What are some ways information is collected?</h2>
                    <p>
We collect information a few ways. For example, we use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement through the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses do not provide us with personally identifiable information such as your name, physical address, email address or telephone number. Cookies are pieces of data that are stored on your hard drive containing personal information. We use cookies to identify an installation of Slacker software, as well as to identify the version of the software you are currently using. Cookies may also be used to auto-sign you into your account, as well as store and authenticate your username and password. Cookies are linked to your personal information so you may not have to sign in and enter a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If you reject the cookie, you may still use our site; however, you will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Rejecting cookies is done through your browser settings on your personal computer. Finally, Web pages may contain an electronic file called a web beacon, which allows a web site to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies. We research certain usage and activities on its and our website. Slacker uses web beacons to conduct this research, including on the Slacker website. The information collected through these web beacons is used to find out more about our users, for more accurate reporting, and to improve the effectiveness of our marketing. Information recorded through the use of these web beacons is aggregated. No personally identifiable information about you is shared by us with any person or entity as a result of this research. If you prefer that Slacker not use information collected from you by these web beacons on our website, please opt out using the methods described in this Privacy Policy.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="sub_heading">Changes to our Privacy Policy</h2>

We may make changes to our privacy policy from time to time. When we do, changes will be reflected directly and immediately in this document so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If, at any point, we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email. Users will have a choice of whether or not we use their information in this different manner. If you do not consent at that time, we will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
