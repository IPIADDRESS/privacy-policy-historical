<p>Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile. While you may voluntarily provide this information to the Company when you create your profile, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs or any video clips that you post on the Website may reveal these kinds of sensitive personal data. Where you do upload and choose to tell the Company sensitive information about yourself, you are expressly consenting to the Company processing your information and making this public to other users.</p>
<p>When you post information about yourself or use the chat system or the boards, the amount of personal information you share is at your own risk. If you post anything that is inconsistent with the Terms of Use, the Company may terminate your account.</p>

To learn how you can manage your other cookies, visit www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of the Website may then be inaccessible or not function properly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company does not control third parties’ collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. But these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way.</p>
<h2>7. How do you access and correct your information?</h2>
<p>You can review and change your personal information by logging into the Website and visiting your account settings page. The Company cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your account. If you want to delete your account, you can click “Delete My Account” in the account settings page. The Company will not accommodate a request to change information if it believes the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.</p>
<p>If you delete your user contributions from the Website, copies of your user contributions might remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other users of the Website. The Website’s Terms of Use govern proper access and use of information provided on the Website, including user contributions.</p>
<p>Please note that even when you remove information, the Company will retain in its files certain data, including information used to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, comply with credit card merchant banking and association agreements, enhance security, reduce fraud, comply with applicable law, or to enforce any agreements, policies, and rules governing your use of the Website. Removed information also may persist in backup copies or other users’ caches.</p>
<h2>8. How does the Company protect your personal information?</h2>
<p>The Company has implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, change, and disclosure. All information you provide to the Company is stored on its secure servers behind firewalls. All payment transactions are encrypted using SSL technology.</p>
<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where the Company has given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. The Company asks you not to share your password with anyone. In addition, the Company urges you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong>&nbsp;The transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure. Although the Company does its best to protect your personal information, the Company cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to the Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. The Company is not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.</p>
<h2>9. Where is your personal information kept?</h2>
<p>This policy is intended to cover collection of information on or through the Website from residents of the Netherlands. If you are visiting the Website from outside the Netherlands, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the Netherlands where the Company’s servers are located and the Company’s central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the Netherlands and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that the Company seeks to take reasonable steps to make sure that your privacy is protected.</p>
<p>By using the Website, you acknowledge that your information may be transferred to the Company’s facilities and those third parties with whom the Company shares it as described in this policy. When you provide personal information to the Company through the Website, you consent to the processing of your data in, and the transfer of your data to, the Netherlands or any other country in which the Company or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers host these services, including the United States.</p>
<h2>10. Do Not Track Policy</h2>
<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in your browser. DNT is a way for you to inform websites and services that you do not want certain information about your webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. The Company is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information it collects and that is why the Company provides you the ability to opt out. But the Company does not recognize or respond to any DNT signals as the Internet industry works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. For more information, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank">allaboutdnt.com</a></p>
