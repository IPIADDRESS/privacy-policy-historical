For this reason, we do not    sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing    purposes without your explicit consent. We want our users to fully understand    what information we collect, how we use this information, and the steps    we take to protect your personal information. Please read this privacy    policy to learn more about the policies and procedures we have put in    place to achieve this goal. This notice describes our Privacy Policy.    By visiting this site, you are accepting the practices described in    this Privacy Policy. </span></div>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-size: small;">This  Web site contains links to a number of sites that offer books for sale.  The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to those  sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on  their privacy, security, data collection, and distribution policies. </span></p>

<div><span style="font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-size: small;">(a)  Information You Provide to Us: We collect any information you enter  on our Site or that you give us in any other way. For example, any time  you create a User account, we collect and save the information. This  information may include username, password, name and email address.  However, this information, except for your username, will not be visible  to other site users. We may use and share information we collect from  our users without prior consent when we collect and compile information  in the aggregate, in a way that would not enable others from identifying  personal information about individual Users. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-size: small;">(b)  Your Usage of Our Site. We automatically track certain information about  you based upon your use of our site. We use this information to conduct  internal research on our users' demographics and behavior to better  understand and serve our users. This information may include the URL  that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you  are using, and your IP address. </span></div>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-size: small;">(c)  Cookies. In addition, we use 'cookies' on certain pages of our site.  Cookies are small files that can be used to track a user's steps or  automatically generate a user's password. Cookies allow you to enter  your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help  us provide information which is targeted to your interests. Cookies  are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. Most cookies are automatically  deleted at the end of a session. You may decline our cookies if your  browser permits, although your use of the site will then be restricted. </span></p>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>3.  How and When the Information is Used. </strong></span><span style="font-size: small;">Your information is used for  administering our business activities. We may use the information to  notify you, either directly or through our agent(s) about changes to  our website, new services, or special offers.

Legal Requests</strong><em>.</em> We cooperate with law enforcement authorities,  as well as with other third parties, to enforce laws, intellectual property  rights, and to prevent fraud. In response to a verified request by law  enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation  or alleged illegal activity, we can, and you authorize us to, disclose  your email address, login history, fraud complaints, and site use history,  with or without a subpoena. Without limiting the above, we will not  disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government  officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal  procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure  of information is necessary to protect our rights or to prevent imminent  physical harm, financial loss or to report suspected past, present,  or future illegal activity. Further, we can, and you authorize us to,  disclose to a third party your information, including your email address,  as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection  with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement,  piracy, or other unlawful activity. </span></p>

How We Protect Your Information.</strong> The privacy and protection of your  information is important to us. We therefore use practices that are  consistent with standards in the industry to protect your privacy. Subject  to the other sections of this Privacy Policy, we do not make any personal  information available to third parties without your permission. Please  note, however, that no transmission over the Internet can be fully guaranteed  in its confidentiality and non-disclosure, and as such you transmit  at your own risk. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-size: small;">Your  access to some services, such as the ability to put books up for sale,  is password protected. We advise that you do not disclose your password  to anyone. In addition, we recommend you sign out of password-protected  services at the end of your session. You are responsible for all actions  taken with your login name and password. Your user password should be  held in strict confidence. If you lose control of your password, you  may lose substantial control over your information. Therefore, if your  password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately  change your password.
