               <p>SLU, as a controller, will only process your personal data fairly and lawfully in
                  compliance with applicable laws, LOPDGDD 3/2018 (the Spanish Data Protection Law)
                  and General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the EU Data Protection Law). Our
                  legal basis for collecting and using the personal information will depend on the personal
                  information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
               </p>
               
               <p>However, we will normally process personal data about you as necessary to perform
                  a student contract with you, where the processing is in our legitimate interests and
                  not overridden by your rights, and when we have a legal obligation to do so. If we
                  are processing your personal data based on consent, we will seek your consent separately
                  at the time of collection.
               </p>
               
               <p>By enrolling as a SLU student, you understand that SLU will be collecting, storing,
                  using and otherwise processing data about you for any purposes connected with your
                  studies, your health and safety, to protect the vital interests of others, as required
                  in compliance with a legal obligation, to perform tasks in the public interest, and
                  for other legitimate reasons while you are a student. We will also use your data for
                  certain purposes after you cease to be student (alumni relations).

               <p>By providing personal data to SLU, your personal data may be transferred to the United
                  States where SLU is headquartered. If you are not a resident of the United States,
                  your country's laws governing data collection and use may differ from those in the
                  United States. For example, the data protection laws of the United States have not
                  been found by the European Commission to provide the same level of protection as EU
                  data protection law. Transfers from the European Economic Area ("EEA") to the United
                  States will take place using the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield. Please contact
                  <a href="mailto:infosecurityteam@slu.edu">infosecurityteam@slu.edu</a> or <a href="mailto:DPO-madrid@slu.edu">DPO-madrid@slu.edu</a>, if you want to receive further information or, where available, a copy of the relevant
                  data transfer mechanism.

               <p>SLU complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth
                  by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of
                  Personal Data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States.
                  SLU has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield
                  Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and
                  the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. The Federal
                  Trade Commission has jurisdiction over SLU's compliance with the Privacy Shield. In
                  the context of an onward transfer, SLU has the liability for the processing of Personal
                  Data it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party
                  acting as an agent on its behalf. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program,
                  and to view our certification, please visitâ¯<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.
               </p>
               
               <p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we commit to resolve complaints
                  about our collection or use of your Personal Data. European Union or Swiss individuals
                  with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact
                  SLU atâ¯<a href="mailto:infosecurity@health.slu.edu">infosecurity@health.slu.edu</a> or <a href="mailto:DPO-madrid@slu.edu">DPO-madrid@slu.edu</a>.
               </p>
               
               <p>SLU has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an
                  alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If we have not
                  resolved your complaint, you may contact or visit <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">https://www.jamsadr.com/</a> for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at
                  no cost to you. Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels,
                  under limited circumstances, binding arbitration may be available. For additional
                  information about the Privacy Shield arbitration process, please visit theâ¯<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction">Privacy Shield website</a>.
               </p>
               
               <p>SLUâ¯has further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection
                  authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner
                  (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning human resources
                  data transferred from the EU and Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship.
