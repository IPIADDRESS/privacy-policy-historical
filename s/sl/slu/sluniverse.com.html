    <b>1/6/2008 Update to Privacy Policy</b><br>
    <br>
    The text regarding the use of third party ad servers was changed to reflect that 
    ads provided by the LinkShare Network's service have been added to the site. 
    Their own privacy policy can be viewed at <a href="http://www.linkshare.com">
    www.linkshare.com</a>. Also added text regarding notification of changes to 
    privacy policy.<br>
<br>
    <b>5/29/2005 - Update to Privacy Policy</b><br>
<br>
    Snapzilla user registration - registered 
SLUniverse.com forum users are now able to use their SLU login to sign into the 
Snapzilla site. To support this feature, it is necessary to associate&nbsp;their 
avatar name with&nbsp;their SLU account by sending an email postcard to /FONT&gt;<font size="2"><a href="mailto:register@sluniverse.com">
<font face="Arial">register@sluniverse.com</font></a><font face="Arial"> (or
</font><a href="mailto:register@slpics.com"><font face="Arial">
register@slpics.com</font></a></font><font size="2" face="Arial"> ) with the 
email address used to register for SLuniverse as the subject. After processing, 
the snapshot will be discarded and&nbsp;the avatar name from Second Life will be 
linked to&nbsp;the SLuniverse login. This one time process only associates an avatar 
name with a forum account, it does not save any additional information. Avatar 
keys are not provided by the postcard functionality, only name.<br>
<b><br>
</b>This additional step is necessary to ensure that only the avatar who took 
the picture is able to edit it. There is no way to spoof the avatar name coming 
from SL in the postcard (even if you change the From: line), so this step 
ensures that the postcard came from the authorized person. </font>

<br>
4/2/2005 - Update to Privacy Policy<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</strong>To support a change added to the email postcards in version 1.6 of 
Second Life, the location information (sim name and x/y coordinates) of each 
snapshot is being saved in addition to the information listed below that is 
saved as part of processing the email. The display of exact coordinates will be 
an opt&nbsp;out feature of Snapzilla - pictures will be filterable by sim name.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">3/27/2005 - Update to Privacy Policy</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A new feature has been added to Snapzilla that 
allows users to email snapshots to a friend. The names and email addresses the 
snapshots are sent to and from are not tracked or saved. The only tracking being 
done is a count of how many times each snapshot has been sent. </font></p>
