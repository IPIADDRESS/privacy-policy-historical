        Privacy Policy
    </h2>

    <div class="policy">
        <p>Last updated: May 2013</p>
        <p>This policy covers how Slice® treats Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") and other information that Slice collects in connection with our services, including information collected through All My Purchases® and other third party websites that use Slice's proprietary email receipts parsing and organization technologies. Slice considers PII to be information that can be traced directly back to and identifies a specific individual or household, such as name, address, email address, and/or phone number. We do not consider PII to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual or household.</p>
        <p>By using this website and accepting the <a href="https://www.slice.com/tos">Terms of Service</a>, you agree to this Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF SERVICE AND YOU MAY NOT USE THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES.</p>
        <h3>I. SCOPE OF PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to PII and other information collected by Slice through your use of Slice or Slice's services and does not apply to any other information collected by Slice through other means (as described below). When you navigate away from our website to websites controlled by third parties, you leave the Slice website, at which point our Privacy Policy no longer applies. We do not provide a notice warning our users when they are leaving our website. </p>
        <h3>II. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
        <p>Slice services include the collection, aggregation, analysis, and organization of email receipts and related information to provide users an integrated, actionable environment to manage and obtain maximum benefits from their purchasing activities. By registering for an account with Slice, you are authorizing us to gather, parse, and retain data and information from emails you receive and have received that are associated with your online and offline purchases and shopping, as necessary to deliver and support our services. As described below, Slice is able to offer its free services to users for free through the development and marketing of aggregate and anonymous consumer data. Except in connection with the sale of the company as described below, Slice does not, and will not, sell or transfer your PII.</p>
        <p>Slice collects PII when you register. In registering with Slice, you may also provide information necessary to use Slice, such as the login credentials for your mail, social networking, or other Internet accounts that you link to Slice. We may also collect PII from you in other ways, such as contacts with our customer-support team.</p>
        <p><strong>Social Sign-On.</strong>  We collect PII when you use your social media credentials to log into the Site. For example, when you log in with your Facebook credentials, we may collect the PII you have made publicly available in Facebook, such as your name and profile picture.</p>
        <p><strong>Non-PII Collection and Use.</strong>  Whenever you visit Slice, Slice also receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Slice cookie information, and the pages you request, and relates it to the PII you provide. Slice uses this information to provide our services, to improve our products and services, to contact you, to conduct research, and to develop and maintain anonymous or aggregated data and analytics.</p>
        <p>In connection with our mobile application, Slice may use tools or third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain data that does not directly identify you, such as: (i) device properties, including, but not limited to unique device identifier or other device identifier ("UDID"); (ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data such as country or region; (v) other similar data as reasonably required by Slice to enhance the services and other Slice products and services. Slice does not share such data with third parties.</p>
        <p>Slice may use and disclose to Slice's service providers the collected non-personal data for purposes of analyzing usage of the services, advertisement serving, managing and providing the Services, and to further develop the services and other Slice services and products. Occasionally we work with other companies for the purposes of data processing or market research product development purposes.</p>
        <p>You recognize and agree that the service providers utilized by Slice may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products relating to your activities. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.</p>
        <h3>III. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
        <p><strong>Our use of PII.</strong>  We use PII for internal and service-related purposes only and we may use vendors and suppliers to allow us to offer and improve Slice. <strong>Slice does not rent, sell, or share PII with other people or nonaffiliated companies for marketing purposes.</strong> We may allow access to other Slice data, under non-disclosure agreements, to develop improvements to our services.</p>
        <p><strong>Third Party site support and usage.</strong>  If you authorize a third party website to scan your email receipts using Slice's technologies, the data in your email, including PII accessed during the scan, will be subject to that third party website's terms of service and privacy policies, even if you have also directly signed up for a Slice account.</p>
        <p><strong>Anonymous use and sharing.</strong>  We may share with third parties anonymized information about Slice users' transactions. Such consumer behavior and information may be of value to third parties in the performance of marketing services, including evaluating market trends and/or under a joint marketing agreement to provide services that will be of particular interest and relevance to you. Again, such information will not include PII. When you deactivate your Slice account, your PII is permanently disassociated with your purchase data. The anonymized purchase data itself may continue to be incorporated in market analyses.</p>
        <p><strong>Legal sharing for protection of us, you, and others.</strong>  We may disclose PII to third parties who are: assisting us in protecting against or preventing actual or potential fraud, unauthorized transactions, claims or other liabilities, or to investigate potential fraudulent or questionable activities. We may disclose PII in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We may disclose PII in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Service, or as we believe may be otherwise required by law. </p>
        <p><strong>Merger or sale.</strong>  If all or substantially all of Slice or its assets are sold or transferred, PII and other information we have collected may be treated as an asset and transferred in accordance with this Policy.  </p>
        <p>We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to Slice, such as service announcements and administrative messages that are considered part of your Slice account.</p>
        <p><strong>Cookies and related technologies.</strong>  Slice uses "cookies." Cookies are small text files that we place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to manage cookies including blocking and deleting them.  If you block or delete our cookies, Slice may not work as well or at all for you. </p>
        <h3>IV. HOW WE SECURE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>Slice limits access to your PII. We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in an effort to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and use correctly the PII we collect from you.</p>
        <p>No data transmissions through the Internet or mobile devices, or even the physical transfer of information, can be guaranteed to be completely secure. We cannot eliminate fully all security risks associated with personal information and technical mistakes are possible. We do not ensure or warrant the security of any data or information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.</p>
        <p>If Slice learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically. You agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues.  We may post a notice on our website if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view and access Slice. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice), you should notify us at: support@slice.com. </p>
        <h3>V. INTERNATIONAL VISITORS</h3>
        <p>Slice is hosted in and intended for use in the United States by U.S. residents.  We may transfer your PII within Slice including to any of our worldwide affiliates acting on our behalf and in accordance with this policy.  </p>
        <p><strong>If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal information to the United States to Slice. By providing your PII you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Policy.</strong></p>
        <h3>VI. HOW TO CONTACT US</h3>
        <p>If you have questions or suggestions, please email Slice at <a href="mailto:support@slice.com">support@slice.com</a> or call (650) 323-9100. Written communication should be sent to Slice Technologies, Inc., Attn: Customer Affairs, 431 Florence Street, Suite 100, Palo Alto, CA 94301.</p>
        <h3>VII. TO REVIEW OR CORRECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>Upon request, we will provide an individual with access to PII that we have collected about them (provided that they have given proof of identity). This information can be requested by sending us an email through the email link provided above or writing to us at the above address. This information can be corrected by sending us an email through the email link provided above or writing to us at the above address.</p>
        <h3>VIII. HOW WE MAY UPDATE OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
        <p>From time to time, we may use PII for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy. If our information practices change, we will immediately post any adjustments to our Policy on this website. The revised version usually will be effective at the time we post it; however, if the revised version includes a change that would be materially less restrictive on our use of your PII, we will provide you with 30 days' prior notice by posting notice of the change on the "Policy Updates" page of our website. If you are concerned about how your information is used, bookmark this page and check back periodically.    </p>
