<p>Miles Bramwell USA, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, d/b/a Slimming World (“Slimming World”, “us”, “we,” or “our”), has created this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of your personal information.

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>“Slimming World” means Slimming World and all other wholly owned groups;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>“Partner” means a business that Slimming World works with to maintain or improve our services, or perform services on our behalf;</p>
	</li>

<p>In connection with your use of our Online Products and Services, we may collect the following information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The email addresses of users who communicate with us via our Online Products and Services or via email;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Information volunteered or submitted by the user, such as:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>“Personally Identifiable Information” (“PII”) including information you provide when you register with our Online Products and Services that can be used to identify you, such as your name, address, date of birth, mobile phone number or email address. While your IP address may not be considered PII on its own, when it is combined with certain other identifiers, it may become PII. More precise location positioning, or location information combined with other data, may make it possible to pinpoint an exact location, which in some instances could be considered PII;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>“Non-PII”, which is information that cannot be used on its own to identify you personally. It may also be linked to your mobile device, which may enable us to recognize your device Some examples of Non-PII include:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>data that you enter into or through using our Online Products and Services such as age, gender, duration of physical activities and other types of information that you provide using our Online Products and Services. You can refuse to supply this type of data, but it may prevent you from engaging in certain Online Product and Service-related content;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>what websites you have visited and information about your visit, including what time of day you visited those websites;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>for the Website, other Non-PII we collect may include your IP address and the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, etc.).</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>“Account Identifiers,” such as your username, password, or credit card information;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>“Account preferences,” such as how often you wish to receive email notifications and which information you choose to share with the community;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>“Health Information”, such as your weight and height, diseases you have been diagnosed with, symptoms, moods and other health-related information; or</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>“Protected Health Information” or “PHI,” which is a subset of Health Information that contains information that identifies or can be reasonably used to identify you. PHI collected and stored by us may not be protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”).</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>“Device Information,” such as the type and model, software version, manufacturer, operating system (e.g. iOS or Android), carrier name, mobile browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari), and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID (AAID), information your browser or operating system automatically provides to us, such as your IP address, your location information, such as the approximate geographic area provided by your Internet service provider (ISP) or location positioning information provided by the location services and GPS features of your mobile device or website when location services have been enabled;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Information about your communications with us, such as information regarding any contact you may have with our chat or support teams.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>In some cases, we have arrangements with Third Parties to collect and store the foregoing information for us, e.g., to provide services in connection with hosting or the operation of our Apps, or to facilitate reporting of analytics regarding our Apps (such as with Google Analytics or WebTrends).</p>

<p>Although the Non-PII information that we share, including the Non-PII that is not linked to your mobile device, does not identify you personally, there is a risk that Third Parties who receive such information from us may be able to re-identify you through other information they gather.</p>

<p>When you register for our Online Products and Services that require payment we ask for certain PII, Non-PII, Health Information and PHI to create your account, including, but not limited to: first name, last name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, applicable billing information (e.g. credit card number and expiration date), current weight, current height, mood, health details, and food preferences. We use this information to personalize your experience within the members’ area and to send you a copy of our new member book.</p>

<p>We may also obtain access to your photo library. We obtain access to your photo library for purposes of building a profile in and uploading photos to our community. Your device will prompt you to ask for your permission for our Apps to access your photo library. If you agree, our Apps may access the photos in your photo library until you manually revoke permission for us to access your photo library or you delete our Apps from your mobile device. If you revoke Slimming World’s access to your photo library, it will prevent our Apps from accessing the photos on your device but it does not affect any photo stored in your online profile.</p>

<p>We may also collect Health Information about you through health apps on your mobile device, such as Google Fit or Apple HealthKit, or activity trackers, such as Fitbit, in order to provide a more seamless weight loss experience for you (“Health Data”). The types of Health Data that we could collect include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Information about your physical traits, such as height, weight and body measurements;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Details about your athletic or recreational activities, such as type of activity, exercise frequency, and performance goals;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Data about athletic performance, such as time spent doing an activity, speed, distance, and heart rate; and</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Like your photo library above, you will be asked for permission to allow our Apps to access Health Data from other apps and activity trackers and we will continue to collect Health Data until you revoke your permission or delete our Apps from your mobile device. If at any time you deny or remove your permission for us to gather Health Data on your mobile device, each time you attempt to use a service on our Apps that uses Health Data, you will be prompted to provide your permission. Revoking permission to collect Health Data does not remove Health Data from our database that we have already collected.</p>

<p>If you connect with us through social media, we may collect account or profile information about you.</p>

<p>Our Online Products and Services may also offer you the opportunity to chat with one of our representatives should you have any questions about Slimming World. Any information that you provide to us during a chat, including any PHI that you disclose, is stored in our database and a copy of the chat may be posted within your member administration area. Any information we provide to you during a chat is not meant to be medical advice. You should consult with your physician or another medical professional before using Slimming World Online Products and Services and follow your physician’s treatment advice. We will not use any information you provide to us during a chat for any marketing purposes. We or our Partners may use the chat to improve our customer service or to enhance our chat features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you choose to opt-out of receiving communications from us in other ways, we will generally be able to give effect to your withdrawal on 30 days’ notice.

<p>At any time you can easily opt-out of receiving further marketing emails from Slimming World by sending us an email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support.team@slimmingworld.com">support.team@slimmingworld.com</a>&nbsp;or by simply clicking the link to unsubscribe at the bottom of any marketing emails that we send to you.</p>

<p><strong>“Do Not Track” and Ad Choices:</strong>&nbsp;There are many mechanisms you can use to manage how we and other parties can monitor your activity on our Apps and elsewhere on the Internet. One option is by using “Do Not Track,” a voluntary program among operators of commercial websites and online services that is intended to give users the ability to opt-out of such tracking. We do not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals from our website, but currently do respond to Do Not Track signals from our Apps.</p>

<p>AdChoices enables you to opt-out of the collection and use of your information in online behavioral advertising. We do not currently serve ads through our Online Products and Services, and therefore AdChoices does not apply to our activities.</p>

<p><strong>Slimming World Support emails.</strong>&nbsp;As part of our service to Slimming World members, to support you in your weight loss, we provide a series of emails throughout your membership. These start with a welcome and membership confirmation email, and also include weighing in reminders and regular support emails. For the first two weeks of your journey we will email you daily to help you as best we can to get to grips with Food Optimizing. You’ll be given the opportunity to opt-out to receiving these emails on the settings page. Although our supportive emails are part of our service to you, you can opt-out or change your preferences at any time.</p>
