<p><b>Introduction:</b></p>

<p>Sling Media respects your privacy.  This Privacy Statement applies to all of our web sites.  This Privacy Statement explains what information we collect through the Sites, how we use that information, and what choices you have.</p>

<p>The Sites contains links to other web sites.  This Privacy Statement does not apply to the practices of any company or individual that Sling Media does not control, or any web sites that you link to from the Sites.  You should use caution and review the privacy policies of any web sites that you visit from ours to learn more about their information practices.</p>

<p>Please take a few moments to read this Privacy Statement.  By accessing the Sites, you agree to accept the terms and conditions of this Privacy Statement and are aware that our policies may evolve in the future as indicated below.  In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Statement and our Terms of Use, our Terms of Use will control.</p>

<p><b>What information we collect:</b></p>

<p>In various places on the Sites, we collect “Personally Identifiable Information,” such as your name, postal address, telephone number, email address, or other information that can be used to identify you or contact you.  For example, we collect this information when you register for our message boards, sign up for our email newsletter, purchase a SlingBox, enter a sweepstakes or participate in promotions and give-aways.  From time to time in the future we may offer additional features, services and promotional opportunities that would require you to submit Personally Identifiable Information to participate.</p>

<p>We also collect “Anonymous Information” such as your IP address, the type of browser you use, the pages on our Sites that you visit, the search terms that you enter or the advertisements that you click. Anonymous information can and will NOT be associated with Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

<p>Like many Internet sites, we also use “cookies” to collect information.  A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer and is stored on your hard drive.   When you visit our Sites the cookie identifies your computer to us so that you do not have to re-register each time you visit.  We also use cookies to measure the traffic to our site and its different services and features, and other miscellaneous uses.</p>

<p>We do not intend that children will use the Sites.  We do not solicit or knowingly collect information from children under 13 years old, nor will we accept registration from them.</p>

<p><b>How we use the information we collect:</b></p>

<p>We use Personally Identifiable Information that you provided us to perform the services for which the data was collected.  For example, if you sign up for our email newsletter, we will send the newsletter to the email address you provided.  If you so choose, we will also use Personally Identifiable Information to send you information about products and services that may be of interest to you.  Later on in this Privacy Statement, we provide you with more information on what choices you have.</p>

<p>We use non-Personally Identifiable Information to determine how people use the Sites and its services. For example this data tells us information including how often users click on our advertisements, which files are downloaded most frequently, and which areas of our site are the most popular. Analyzing this data allows us to improve the offerings on and performance of our Sites.</p>

<p><b>How we share information:</b></p>

<p>We sometimes use third parties to help with some of the services available on our Sites, such as processing credit card payments and providing marketing assistance.  When we supply Personally Identifiable Information to these third parties, we require them to use it only for the function they are helping us with.</p>

<p>We aggregate the Anonymous Information that we collect and exchange it with advertisers and others who are interested in our services.</p>

<p>We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information as required by law, or if in our judgment it is necessary to protect Sling Media or our users from loss or liability.  If we merge with or are acquired by another company, the resulting combined company will use the information you have provided as described in this policy.  If we cease operation, your information may be transferred to and used by another company that offers similar or related products or services.  While we cannot predict a great deal about such an unlikely event, we would hope this could provide you continuity of service.</p>

<p><b>What choices you have:</b></p>

<p>When you register for the Sites, you have the option of checking a box to tell us that you do not want us to send you any information about our products and services, or that you do not want to receive information from our partners and others about products and services that might interest you.  We will keep track of your decision in our database.  Even if you choose not to receive information from us, we reserve the right to communicate with you on matters we consider especially important.</p>

<p><b>Postings:</b></p>

<p>If you register to use our bulletin boards, please remember that anything you post is publicly available.  Your profile will also be available to other users of our bulletin board service.</p>

<p><b>Security:</b></p>

<p>During sessions in which you give us information such as credit card numbers, we encrypt your transmissions using SSL (“Secure Sockets Layer”),and other security technology.  This guards against interception of the information while it is on the Internet.  We keep the Personally Identifiable Information you provide on servers that are protected by firewalls and other technological means against intrusion or unauthorized access.  They are located in a physically secure facility, and only our employees and agents with a need to know the information are given access.  However, there is no such thing as “perfect security” on the Internet.  We rely on you to select passwords that cannot be guessed easily and to safeguard those passwords from disclosure.  Please contact us if you have any information regarding unauthorized use of the Sites.</p>
