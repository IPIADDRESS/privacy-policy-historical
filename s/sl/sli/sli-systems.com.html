</ul>

<p><b>4. Our Security Measures to Protect your Personal Information</b><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Company uses industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving data exchanged between our Company and other companies to help ensure its security. This site has security measures in place to help protect information under our control from the risk of accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration or unauthorized disclosure or access. However, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet. &nbsp;Also, if this website contains links to other sites, our Company is not responsible for the security practices or the content of such sites.</span></p>
<p><b>5.&nbsp; Our Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, Web Analytics Services, and Links</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cookies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many of our web pages use “cookies.” Cookies are text files we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services. You have many choices with regards to the management of cookies on your computer. All major browsers allow you to block or delete cookies from your system. To learn more about your ability to manage cookies, please consult the privacy features in your browser.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Web Beacons.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Our Company and third parties may also use small pieces of code called “web beacons” or “clear gifs” to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. These “web beacons” may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our Company’s cookie requirements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Web Analytics Services.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We use Google Analytics, a service for the marketing analysis of the site provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to allow us to see how you use our site so we can improve your experience. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use available at </span><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the Google Privacy Policy available at </span><a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the site by disabling cookies in your browser. If you prefer to not have data reported by Google Analytics, you can install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on available at </span><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Website Links</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We may create links to other web sites. We will make a reasonable effort to link only to sites that meet similar standards for maintaining each individual’s right to privacy. However, many other sites that are not associated with or authorized by our Company may have links leading to our site. Our Company cannot control these links and we are not responsible for any content appearing on these sites. Since this website does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy practices of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose any personal information to others.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>App Links</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A given application may provide you with an advertising link to other, third-party sites and applications.&nbsp; Such third-party sites will have their own data collection practices and policies. Please review the privacy policy for such sites and exercise caution in providing information that personally identifies you.&nbsp; We have no responsibility, access, or control over the data collection practices and policies of such third-party sites and applications. You will use such sites and applications at your own risk and outside of the scope of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; The provision of such advertisements is done on an “As Is” basis, with no endorsements or representations.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Other</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our Company websites may use third parties to present or serve the advertisements that you may see at its web pages and to conduct research about the advertisements and web usage. This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that such third parties may have collected from you or the methods used by the third parties to collect that information.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>6. Legal Basis for Processing your Personal Data (EEA and Switzerland only)</b><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With respect to personal data collected from individuals from the European Economic Area or Switzerland, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. Our Company will normally collect personal data from you only where: (a) we have your consent to do so, (b) where we need the personal data to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the services you have requested), or (c) where the processing is in our or a third party’s legitimate interests (and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms).</span></p>
<p><b>7. Limiting Use, Disclosure, Retention</b><br>
Our Company identifies the purposes for which the information is being collected before or at the time of collection. The collection of your personal data will be limited to that which is needed for the purposes identified by our Company. Unless you consent or we are required by law, we will only use the personal data for the purposes for which it was collected. If our Company will be processing your personal data for another purpose later on, our Company will seek your further legal permission or consent; except where the other purpose is compatible with the original purpose. We will keep your personal data only as long as required to serve those purposes. We will also retain and use your personal data for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<p><b>8. International Transfers of your Personal data<br>
</b>We are a global company. Information collected from you may be stored and processed in the European Economic Area, the United States or any other country in which our Company or agents or contractors maintain facilities, and by accessing our sites and using our services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Such countries may have laws which are different, and potentially not as protective, as the laws of your own country.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever we share personal data originating in the European Economic Area or Switzerland we will rely on lawful measures to transfer that data, such as the Privacy Shield or the EU standard contractual clauses. If you reside in the EEA or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal data to the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. By providing your personal data, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Policy.</span></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;9. Accuracy of Personal data</b><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We do our best to ensure that the personal data we hold and use is accurate. We rely on the customers we do business with to disclose to us all relevant information and to inform us of any changes.</span></p>
<p><b>10. Your Access to and Updating of your Personal data<br>
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasonable access to your personal data may be provided upon request made to our Company at the contact information provided below. If access cannot be provided within that time frame, our Company will provide the requesting party a date when the information will be provided. If for some reason access is denied, we will provide an explanation as to why access has been denied. We may charge a reasonable fee in advance for copying and sending the information requested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you would like us to delete any personal Data held about you, we will do so on request unless we need to hold the information as part of the provision of products and services to you.</span></p>
<p><b>11. Marketing Communications<br>
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We offer those who provide personal contact information a means to choose how we use the information provided. You may manage your receipt of marketing and non- transactional communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of our marketing emails.</span></p>
<p><b>12. Additional Rights (EEA and Switzerland only)</b><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you reside in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, you may have the right to exercise additional rights available to you under applicable laws, including:</span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>For EEA, UK, and Swiss Individuals: Privacy Shield Notice for Personal Data Transfers to the United States</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SLI Systems complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Economic Area (“EEA”) member countries, the United Kingdom (“UK”) and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. SLI Systems has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit </span><a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>A) Definitions</b><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Personal Data” means information that (1) is transferred from the EEA, the UK or Switzerland to the United States; (2) is recorded in any form; (3) is about or pertains to a specific individual; and (4) can be linked to that individual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sensitive Personal Information” means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or that concerns an individual’s health.</span></p>
<p><b>B) Principles</b><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">SLI Systems may receive Personal Data from its own personnel as well as from its affiliates, resellers, customers, end-users and other parties located in the EEA, the UK or Switzerland. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such information may contain, but is not limited to name (first and last name), position, address, email address, phone number, login credentials, human resources data and transaction information and may be about customers, clients of customers, business partners, acquisition targets, potential buyers consultants, employees, and candidates for employment and includes information recorded on various media as well as electronic data. In addition, we might collect location and traffic data. Please refer to our main </span><b>Privacy Policy Statement</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (above) for more information regarding our data handling practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SLI Systems is the controller of its own human resources data. In addition, SLI Systems acting as a data processor or sub-processor may receive Personal Data via its customers. SLI Systems executes data processing agreements with such customers which set out the parties’ obligations and responsibilities to comply with the Principles. SLI Systems will cooperate with its customers to enable them to comply with the Principles.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever SLI Systems processes Personal Data, SLI Systems complies with the Principles (as each Principle is applicable to the Company’s role):</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><b> Notice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Whenever we collect Personal Data directly from individuals, we shall inform an individual of the purpose for which we collect and use their Personal Data and the types of third parties to which SLI Systems discloses or may disclose that Personal Data. Please refer to our main </span><b>Privacy Policy Statement</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more information regarding our data handling practices.&nbsp; SLI Systems shall provide the individual with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Data. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Data to SLI Systems, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before SLI Systems uses or discloses the Personal Data for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected. SLI Systems may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</span></li>
<li><b> Choice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Whenever SLI Systems collects Personal Data directly from individuals, those individuals have the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their Personal Data is (1) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party or (2) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual by contacting our Data Protection Officer via email at privacy@sli-systems.com. In some of these cases, opting out may require SLI Systems to cease providing part or all of the contracted services for which that Personal Data is needed.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">For Sensitive Personal Information, SLI Systems will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively or explicitly (opt in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-Agent third party or for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. SLI Systems shall treat Sensitive Personal Information received from an individual the same as the individual would treat and identify it as Sensitive Personal Information. &nbsp;Agents, technology vendors and contractors of SLI Systems or affiliated companies may have access to an individual’s Personal Data on a need to know basis for the purpose of performing services on behalf of SLI Systems or providing or enabling elements of the services. All such agents, technology vendors and contractors who have access to such information are contractually required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for SLI Systems or as otherwise required by law.</span></li>
<li><b> Accountability for Onward Transfer.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Whenever we collect Personal Data directly from individuals, prior to disclosing Personal Data to a third party, we shall notify the individual of such disclosure and allow the individual the choice (opt out) of such disclosure. SLI Systems shall ensure that any third party to which Personal Data may be disclosed agrees in writing to provide the same level of privacy protection as set forth in this policy.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Company’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, SLI Systems remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless SLI Systems proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol start="4">
<li><b> Data Security.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We shall take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. SLI Systems has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Personal Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. However, SLI Systems cannot guarantee the security of Personal Data on or transmitted via the Internet.</span></li>
<li><b> Data Integrity</b> <b>and Purpose Limitation.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We shall only process Personal Data in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, SLI Systems shall take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.</span></li>
<li><b> Access.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We acknowledge the individual’s right to access their Personal Data. We shall allow an individual access to their Personal Data and allow the individual the opportunity to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. Individuals may contact our Data Protection Officer via email at privacy@sli-systems.com to request to access, correct, amend, or delete the personal information SLI Systems holds about you. In cases where SLI Systems is a Data Sub-Processor or Processor, individuals must contact the Data Processor or the Data Controller, as applicable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b> Enforcement and Dispute Resolution.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, SLI Systems is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, SLI Systems commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. EEA and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact us at:&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol>
<li><b> Human Resources Data</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If your complaint involves human resources data transferred to the United States from the EEA, UK or Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship, and SLI Systems does not address it satisfactorily, SLI Systems commits to cooperate with the panel established by the data protection authorities (DPA Panel) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, as applicable and to comply with the advice given by the DPA panel and Commissioner, as applicable with regard to such human resources data.&nbsp; To pursue an unresolved human resources complaint, you should contact the state or national data protection or labor authority in the appropriate jurisdiction.&nbsp; Complaints related to human resources data should not be addressed to the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b> Non-Human Resources Data</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. SLI Systems has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit </span><a href="http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your Privacy Shield complaint was not resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms.&nbsp; See Privacy Shield Annex 1 at </span><a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction</span></a></p>
<p><b>C) Amendments</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Statement may be amended from time to time consistent with the requirements of the Shield Frameworks. We will post any revised policy on this website.</span></p>
<p><b>D) Information Subject to Other Policies</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are committed to following the Principles for all Personal Data within the scope of the Privacy Shield Frameworks. However, certain information is subject to policies of SLI Systems that may differ in some respects from the general policies set forth in this Privacy Statement.</span></p>
