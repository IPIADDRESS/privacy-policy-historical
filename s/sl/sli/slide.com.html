<p class="bigheader">Privacy Policy</p>
<p>
Welcome to Slide, a personal online service operated by Slide Inc. ("Slide") which includes Slide software, content, related documentation, information on the Slide domain, and information made available by users to each other through the Slide software (collectively, the .Service.).  Your privacy is important to us and as described in this Privacy Policy, we have designed the Service to protect information about you from unauthorized disclosure to others.  We do not sell or rent your personally identifying information to any third party.  This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and, in certain circumstances, share your personal identifying information.  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us. 
</p>
<p>
By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.  From time to time, we may update the Privacy Policy and we will post a notice of significant changes on the website www.slide.com.  You should visit this page periodically to review any such changes to the Privacy Policy. 
</p>
<h2> What We Collect</h2>
<p>
When you register to become a member of Slide, we collect your name, email address and other personal identifying information that you submit.  Also, as part of your personal profile, you may choose to make available to us additional personal information such as gender, age, occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc., as well as other content, such as blogs (web logs), titles in your media library and photos, each of which you may include in .Channels..  It is entirely up to you whether you want to submit this additional information, and whether you would like to make it or your Channels available to other members.  To protect your privacy, the Service allows you to limit who can view your personal information.  However, Slide has no responsibility for how people you allow to view your personal information or content (or the public if you make any information available to the public) use that material.
</p>
<p>
When you invite new members into your network or send messages through the Slide service, we collect and maintain on secure servers the information associated with those messages, including email addresses and content.  Finally, in order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain reports on web casting of images, we collect aggregate information about your use of the Service.  
</p>
<h2> How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>
We make your profile and other user information available to other users according to the privacy settings you set for yourself as part of your profile.  Your user name will be identified to us and to any recipient of messages you send through the Service.  We also use your name, email address and other information on our system to notify you of new product releases, service notifications, and to solicit your feedback and input. 
</p><p>
You understand and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose your personal information and the contents of your account if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to protect our rights and property, or that of our affiliates or the public.  Slide may also delete certain content in whole or in part if Slide determines, in its sole discretion, that such content constitutes an .Infringing Posting. or a .Prohibited Posting. as defined in our <a href="/static/terms">Terms of Use</a>.
</p>
<p>
We also use non-personally identifiable information and certain technical information about your computer in order to operate, maintain and manage the Service. 
</p><h2> Controlling Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>
As with any social networking service, you should use care when disclosing your personal information to strangers.  Be advised that if you send messages or post material containing personal information, that information may be collected and used by others.  The Service provides a number of tools that you can use to control the availability of your profile and other personal information.  You can edit your profile and other information at any time through the Slide software.  You can also adjust your privacy settings using the Slide software so that only you, your friends, and/or friends of friends may view your information or Channels, or you can make that information available to everyone. 
</p>
<p>
You can terminate your account at any time which will remove your profile and other personal information from view.  Slide, however, may (but is not obligated to) keep information about you that is on its system following your termination.  Contact Slide to terminate your account or for any other questions about your personal information. 
</p>
<h2> Transfer of Information</h2>
<p>
We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Slide, such as acquisition by or merger with another company.  In such an event, Slide will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 
</p>
<h2> Others' Information</h2>
<p>
If you invite another person to join Slide, we will ask for that person's name and email address.  We use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person that he or she has been invited to join Slide.  All invitees are provided with the option not to receive further invitations from Slide.  We may disclose such information if required to do so in order to comply with valid legal process, as described above. 
</p>
<h2> Cookies</h2>
<p>
We send "cookies" to your computer and use such cookies as described here.  A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique user.  We use cookies to improve the quality of our service and make the service easier to use for our members.  In order to provide you a seamless experience during a particular login session, we store information about that session in cookies.  
</p>
<h2> Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>
Slide may contain links to other web sites.  These other sites maintain their own policies regarding cookies and the collection and use of personal information.  It is up to you to review those policies yourself.
</p>
<h2> Security</h2>
<p>
We use industry standard security measures to protect your information so that it is not made available to unauthorized parties.  If you have any questions regarding which measures and techniques we use, feel free to contact us. 
</p>
<h2> Additional Questions</h2>
<p>
Again, feel free to contact us by sending an email to Webmaster@Slide.com, any time, if you have further questions about Slide.
