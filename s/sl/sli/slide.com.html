<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
Welcome to Slide, a personal online service operated by Slide Inc. ("Slide") which includes Slide software, content, related documentation, information on the Slide domain, and information made available by users to each other through the Slide software (collectively, the "Service").  Your privacy is important to us and, as described in this Privacy Policy, we have designed the Service to protect information about you from unauthorized disclosure to others.  This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and, in certain circumstances, share your personal identifying information.  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us. 
</p>
<p>
By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy, as such policy may be amended from time to time.  We may update the Privacy Policy and if we do, we will post a notice of significant changes on the website www.slide.com.  You should visit this page periodically to review any changes to the Privacy Policy. 
</p>
<h2> What We Collect</h2>
<p>
When you register to become a member of Slide, you can create an anonymous account, or you can give us your email address and create a registered account.  If you create a registered account, we collect your email address and the user name you create.  Currently, we don't collect any other personal identifying information. In the future, however, we may offer you the opportunity to submit that kind of information (such as gender, age, occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.).  
</p>
<p>
In addition to personally identifiable information, you may submit other content ("Content"), such as blogs (web logs), titles in your media library, photos and other media, each of which you may include in "Slide Shows".  It is entirely up to you whether you want to submit this additional information, and whether you would like to make it or your Slide Shows available to others.  To protect your privacy, the Service allows you to limit who can view your Content.  However, Slide has no responsibility for how people you allow to view your Content (or the public if you make any information available to the public) use that material.  Moreover, if you "embed" a Slide Show on another web page, it will be visible to the public in accordance with the policies of that web page, regardless of whether you have restricted access to that Slide Show on Slide.
</p>
<p>
When you invite new members into your network or send messages through the Slide service, we collect and maintain on secure servers the information associated with those messages, including email addresses and content. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, in order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain internal reports, we collect aggregate information about the use of the Service, including information about users accessing the Slide site or viewing Slide shows on other sites, such as internet protocol addresses.   
</p>

<h2> How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>
We do not sell or rent your personally identifying information to any third party.
</p>
<p>
We make your profile available to other users according to the privacy settings you set for yourself as part of your profile.  Your user name will be identified to us and to any recipient of messages you send through the Service.  We also use your name, email address and other information on our system to notify you of new product releases, service notifications, and to solicit your feedback and input.  In the event that we decide to allow you to submit other information about yourself, the availability of that information to other users will also be controlled by privacy settings you set for yourself.
</p>
<p>
You understand and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose your personal information and the contents of your account if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to protect our rights and property, or that of our affiliates or the public. Slide may maintain copies of your content indefinitely, or delete certain content in whole or in part if Slide determines, in its sole discretion, that such content constitutes an "Infringing Posting" or a "Prohibited Posting" as defined in our  <a href="http://www.slide.com/static/terms">Terms of Use</a> or for any or no reason.
</p>
<p>
We also use non-personally identifiable information and certain technical information about your computer and your access of the Service in order to operate, maintain and manage the Service. 
</p>

<h2> Controlling Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>
Be advised that if you send messages or post material containing personal information, that information may be collected and used by others.  The Service provides a number of tools that you can use to control the availability of your profile and other personal information.  You can edit your profile and other information at any time through the Slide software.  You can also adjust your profile and the privacy setting of each Slide Show you've created using the Slide software so that only you, your friends, and/or friends of friends may view your information or Slide Shows, or you can make that information available to everyone. 
</p>
<p>
You can terminate your account at any time which will remove your profile and other personal information from view.  Slide, however, may (but is not obligated to) keep information about you that is on its system following your termination.  Contact Slide to terminate your account or for any other questions about your personal information. 
</p>

<h2> Transfer of Information</h2>
<p>
We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Slide, such as acquisition by or merger with another company.  In such an event, Slide will notify users who have provided email addresses before information about those users is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 
</p>

<h2> Others' Information</h2>
<p>
You may decide to provide us with another person's email address so that person may be invited to join Slide.  We use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person that he or she has been invited to join Slide.  All invitees are provided with the option not to receive further invitations from Slide.  We may disclose such information if required to do so in order to comply with valid legal process, as described above. 
</p>

<h2> Cookies</h2>
<p>
The Slide Service sends "cookies" to your computer when you access the Slide site, or otherwise view content through a Slide Show and uses such cookies as described here.  The Service uses cookies to improve the quality of our service and make the Service easier to use for our members.  A cookie is a small text file recorded on your hard drive that identifies you as a unique user and contains certain information about your particular login session and/or your use of the Service. 
</p>

<h2> Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>
Slide may contain links to other web sites.  These other sites maintain their own policies regarding cookies and the collection and use of personal information.  It is up to you to review those policies yourself.  In addition, when you "embed" a Slide Show on another web site, the availability of that Slide Show to the general public will be governed by the policies of that website.  
</p>

<h2> Security</h2>
<p>
We use industry standard security measures to protect your information so that it is not made available to unauthorized parties. If you have any questions regarding which measures and techniques we use, feel free to contact us. 
</p>

<h2> Additional Questions</h2>
<p>
Again, feel free to contact us by sending an email to webmaster@slide.com, any time, if you have further questions about Slide or this Privacy Policy.
