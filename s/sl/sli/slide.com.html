<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last Updated April 25, 2008</p>

<p>Welcome to Slide, a personal online service operated by Slide
Inc. ("Slide") which includes Slide software (which consists of, among other things, software that you
have downloaded or are about to download, any software that you have embedded
on a web site or are about to embed (“Slide Widgets”), any
applications created by Slide and available through social networking sites
(“SNS Apps”) and any software running on Slide's server, collectively the “Slide Software”), content, related
documentation, information on the Slide domain, and information made available
by users to each other through the Slide Software (collectively, the
“Service”).  Your privacy is important to us and, as described in this Privacy
Policy, we have designed the Service to protect information about you from
unauthorized disclosure to others.  This Privacy Policy explains how we
collect, use and, in certain circumstances, share your personally identifying
information.  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any
questions, feel free to contact us.
</p>
<p>
By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information 
as outlined in this Privacy Policy, as such policy may be amended from time to time.  We 
may update the Privacy Policy and if we do, we will post a notice that changes have been 
made on the website www.slide.com.  You should visit this page periodically to review any 
changes to the Privacy Policy. 
</p>
<h2>What We Collect</h2>
<p>
Slide gives you a number of options regarding what information you will give
us:</p>

<p>When you register to become a member of Slide, you can create an anonymous
account, or you can give us your email address and create a registered
account. </p>

<p>When you identify yourself on a Slide Widget, you may do so anonymously, or
you may provide your name and or an email address.</p>

<p>When you become a “Fan” of a Slideshow, you may do so
anonymously, or you may provide your name and/or an email address.  </p>

<p>In each case, we will collect and record the information you have provided.
Other than names and email addresses provided at your discretion, we don't
generally collect any “Personally Identifying Information” about
our users (such as social security number, telephone number, street address,
drivers license number, etc.).  However, we may offer you the opportunity to
submit other information about yourself (such as gender, age, occupation,
hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.), or we may be able to collect that
information from social networking systems on which you have installed Slide
Widgets or SNS Apps (in accordance with the terms of use of those systems),
which would then also be covered by this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
In addition to information about yourself, you may submit other content 
("Content"), such as blogs (web logs), titles in your media library, photos and other 
media, each of which you present through technology available through the Service.
It is entirely up to you whether you want to submit this additional
information, and whether you would like to make it or your Slide Widgets
available to others.  To protect your privacy, the Service allows you to mark
your Content as “Private”, in which event it can only be seen by
you and people with whom the unique URL of your Content has been shared,
or in accordance with the terms applicable to social networking sites on which you include Content through SNS Apps.
However, Slide has no responsibility for how people you allow to view your
Content (or the public if you make any information available to the public)
use that material, or to whom they may forward it.  Moreover, if you "embed" a
Slide Widget on another web page or share Content through an SNS App, it will be visible to the public in accordance
with the policies of that web page, regardless of whether you have restricted
access to that Content on Slide.
</p>
<p>
When you install an SNS App on your social network page or use an SNS App on
someone else's page, we may record information regarding the use of that SNS
App, and we may collect other information that is visible on your social
network page in accordance with the relevant terms of use associated with that
page.  When you invite new members into your network or send messages through
the Slide Service, we collect and maintain on secure servers the information
associated with those messages, including email addresses and content.
</p>
<p>
You should also be aware that most video delivered through Slide SNS Apps or
Slide Widgets originates with another content provider.  Such other content
providers may place “cookies” on Your browser, or otherwise gather
information about You, including by asking You to provide information through
the video player itself.  Users are able to insert a wide variety of video
players within our SNS Apps and Widgets, and we cannot control the operation
of such video players.  IT IS UP TO YOU TO REVIEW THE TERMS OF USE AND PRIVACY
POLICY OF THE ORIGINATORS OF SUCH CONTENT.
</p>
<p>

Finally, in order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make
certain internal reports and make recommendations, we collect aggregate information about the use of
the Service, including information about users accessing the Slide site or
viewing Slide Widgets or using SNS Apps on other sites, such as internet protocol addresses,
browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform
type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the
order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the
date and time (“Activity Information”).

</p>
<p>
By using the Slide Service, you consent to our retaining all the
above-described information in anonymous form indefinitely.
</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>
We do not sell or rent your “Personally Identifiable Information”
to any third party.  We may, however, use certain information about you that is
not Personally Identifiable Information in determining the kinds of Content
that you would like to view and to assist any advertisers in targeting their
advertising.
</p>
<p>
We make your profile available to other users according to the privacy
settings you set for yourself as part of your profile.  Your user name will be
identified to us and to any recipient of messages you send through the
Service.  We also use your name, email address and other information on our
system to notify you of new product releases, service notifications, and to
solicit your feedback and input.  In the event that we decide to allow you to
submit other information about yourself, the availability of that information
to other users will also be controlled by privacy settings you will set for
yourself.  In the event that you make your Slide Widgets publicly available, or
“embed” them on another publicly available web site (such as a
social networking site), we may include links to those shows or web sites or
otherwise identify them in our marketing materials as places where Slide Widgets
that may interest other users can be found.

</p>
<p>
If you choose to become a “Fan” of a Slideshow or identify
yourself as a visitor to a Guestbook, and provide us with an email address, we
will allow the owner of that Slideshow or Guestbook to send you communications
through the Service.  Those emails will contain an “unsubscribe” link should
you ever decide you do not want to receive further emails from the owner of
that Slideshow or Guestbook.
</p>
<p>
You understand and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose any
information we may have about you and the contents of your account if required
to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or
disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal
process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to
protect our rights and property, or that of our affiliates or the
public. Slide is not required to question or contest the validity of any
search warrant, subpoena or other similar governmental request that Slide
receives.  Slide may maintain copies of your Content indefinitely, or delete
certain Content in whole or in part if Slide determines, in its sole
discretion, that such Content constitutes an "Infringing Posting" or a
"Prohibited Posting" as defined in our <a href="http://www.slide.com/static/terms">Terms of Use</a> or for any or
no reason.
</p>
<p>
We also use non-Personally Identifiable Information and certain technical
information about your computer and your access of the Service (including your
internet protocol address) in order to operate, maintain and manage the
Service.  Slide may disclose information about you to its partners in order to
provide the Service, resolve service problems and correct errors in the
Service, to communicate with you about the Service, to provide you with
advertising and promotional information in connection with the Service, and to
enhance your experience on the Service. However, we do not give our partners
an independent right to share this information. Due to our contractual
obligations with these third parties and the need to share information to
deliver and support the Service, we cannot provide you with the opportunity to
opt-out of sharing information (whether Personally Identifiable Information or
other information) with these third parties.  Slide, certain of its partners,
and each of their contractors and employees may view the Content that you
upload to the Service in order to provide the Service and otherwise perform
the tasks set forth in this Privacy Policy.

</p>

<h2>Controlling Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>
Be advised that if you send messages or post material containing personal
information, that information may be collected and used by others.  The
Service provides a number of tools that you can use to control the
availability of your profile and other personal information.  You can edit
your profile and other information at any time through the Slide software.
You can also adjust your profile and the privacy setting of each Slide Widget
you've created using the Slide Service so that only you, your friends, and/or
friends of friends with whom the unique URL of your Content has been shared
may view your information or Slide Widgets, or you can make that information
available to everyone.  Moreover, if you “embed” a Slide Widget on
another web page or share Content through an SNS App, it will be visible to the public in accordance with the
policies of that web page or social networking site, regardless of whether you have restricted access to
that Content on Slide.  Slide has no responsibility for how people you
allow to view your Content (or the public if you make any information
available to the public) use that material, or to whom they may forward it.
</p>
<p>
You can terminate your account at any time which will remove your profile and other 
personal information from view.  Slide, however, may (but is not obligated to) keep 
information about you that is on its system following your termination.  Contact Slide 
to terminate your account or for any other questions about your personal information. 
</p>

<h2>Transfer of Information</h2>
<p>
We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer 
of ownership of Slide or the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Slide related to the business which collected such information, such as acquisition by or merger with another company.  In such 
an event, Slide will notify users who have provided email addresses when information 
about those users is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 
</p>

<h2>Others' Information</h2>
<p>
You may decide to provide us with another person's email address so that person may be 
invited to join Slide. You may also provide us with another person's contact information for purposes of delivering information through SNS Apps .  We use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind 
that person that he or she has been invited to join Slide or received content through an SNS App.  All invitees are provided 
with the option not to receive further invitations from Slide.  We may disclose such 
information if required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as described 
above. 
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
The Slide Service sends "cookies" to your computer when you access the Slide
site, or otherwise view content through a Slide Widget, or use an SNS App and
uses such cookies as described here.  The Service uses cookies to improve the
quality of our service, make recommendations, and make the Service easier to use for our members.  A
cookie is a small text file recorded on your hard drive that identifies you as
a unique user and contains certain information about your particular login
session and/or your use of the Service.
</p>

<h2>Use of Information</h2>
<p>
Slide may contain links to other web sites, and content in Slide Widgets may be
hosted by other web sites.  In addition, as described above, most video offered through Slide Widgets or SNS Apps is served or hosted by other sites. These other sites maintain their own policies
regarding cookies and the collection and use of personal information. It is up
to you to review those policies yourself.  Finally, you should be aware that
when you “embed” a Slide Widget on another web site or share Content through an SNS App, the
availability of that Content to the general public will be governed by the
policies of that web site or social networking site.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Advertising Companies</h2>
<p>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our site and on
certain Slide Widgets and SNS Apps.  Our system and the third-party
advertising technology uses information derived from Activity Information, Slide's cookies on your hard drive, your visits to our site,
the Slide Widgets that you view and the SNS Apps you use to target advertising
within our site or Slide Widgets or SNS Apps.  In addition, our advertisers
may use other third-party advertising technology to target advertising on our
site and other sites.  In the course of advertisements being served to you, a
unique third-party cookie or cookies may be placed on your computer.
Similarly, third-party advertising companies may provide us with pixel tags
(also called “clear gifs” or “beacons”) to help manage
and optimize our online advertising.  Beacons enable us to recognize a
browser's cookie when a browser visits the site on which the beacon is
located, and to learn which banner ads bring users to a given site.  To
“opt-out”, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Slide does not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to third-party
advertising companies. Note, however, that if an advertiser asks Slide to show
an advertisement to users with certain characteristics (for example, women
ages 18-24) or a segment of that group (for example, women ages 18-24 who have
viewed certain categories of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the
third-party advertising company may conclude that you have the characteristics
of the audience that they are trying to reach.
</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
We use industry standard security measures to protect your information so that it is 
not made available to unauthorized parties. If you have any questions regarding which 
measures and techniques we use, feel free to contact us. 
</p>

<h2>Contests, Sweepstakes, and Promotions</h2>
<p>
From time to time you may be able to participate in contests, giveaways,
sweepstakes or other similar promotions we sponsor.  Participation may require
sharing your personal information with us or third parties sponsoring the
contest, giveaway, or promotion, and you should check the rules to determine
how your information will be used and shared with others. In addition, as a
condition to receiving any awards or prizes, you may be required to provide
additional information, to sign a release, or to authorize the use of certain
information about you in marketing materials. If a third party administers the
contest, your participation may be subject to additional terms and conditions
and that third party's privacy policy. We are not responsible for such third
parties. You should carefully review these third parties' terms and
conditions.
</p>

, any time, if 
you have further questions about Slide or this Privacy Policy.
