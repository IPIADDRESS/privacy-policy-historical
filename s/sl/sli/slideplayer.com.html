<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What Are Cookies?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the users. </span><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses. </span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to us in your cookies. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">IP Addresses</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Sharing and Selling Information</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>We <b>do not</b> share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process transactions or provide services that you have requested. </span></p>
