<br>

	<p>Your privacy is important to us, as it is to you. We will not give, sell or rent your email address to any third party and at time, for any reason.</p><br>
	<p>When you register with us, we ask you to provide your name, email address and an account password. We use your email address to send administrative email messages to you from time to time. For certain premium services, we also request credit card or other payment account information.</p><br>
	<p>You can decide not to submit personal information, in which case we won't be able to make the SlideShare services available to you.</p><br>
	<p>When you visit this site, we send one or more cookie to your computer, for the purpose of uniquely identifying your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our services. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent, but that may make it impossible to use our services.</p><br>
	<p>At your option, and in your sole discretion, you may provide us with certain demographic information, such as your age, city and country. This information is collected (and is made public) to facilitate the social networking that is inherent in the services. We will not distribute that information with any other personal information about you, except to the extent that content you submit for publication on the site specifically includes any such personal information.</p><br>
	<p>When you use our services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</p><br>
	<p>When you send email or other communication to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. We won't share any information you send to us in those communications with any third parties.</p><br>
	<p>Our privacy policy applies only to this site. We do not exercise control over any site that may be linked to from content that is displayed within content on this site.</p><br>
	<p>If at any time in the future, we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than our internal use in maintaining the services, troubleshooting, improving our services, etc., then we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes.</p><br>
	<p>If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p><br>
	<p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who have registered with us, the volume and pattern of traffic to and within the site, etc. That information will not identify you, the individual, in any way.</p><br>
	<p>We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p><br>
	<p>Please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of policy changes).</p><br>
	<p>If you have any questions about this policy, please feel free to <a href="/contact">contact us</a> or to write to us at:</p>
