			<h1>SlideRocket Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="intro">Welcome to SlideRocket’s website, application, products, services and software (collectively referred to as the “Services”), operated by SlideRocket, Inc., a subsidiary of VMware, Inc.  SlideRocket allows you to create, collaborate and share stunning, media-rich presentations. Any registered user can create a presentation that can include content like photos, videos, audio recordings and links to other websites.</p>

			<p class="highlight">Tip: SlideRocket presentations can be made publicly available around the world.</p>
			
			<p>The privacy and protection of your personal information is very important to us, and we have created this Privacy Policy in order to help you understand how SlideRocket collects and uses your personal information and how your information may be made available to third parties. </p>

For some organizational, corporate or educational accounts, we may ask you to provide additional information, including your phone number, the name and size of your company, organization or school, your job title, billing information and address, postal code, contact information and your website.  Additionally, if your account is part of a larger organizational account, such as a corporate account or an educational account, we may receive your email address from your organization, corporation or school’s account administrator.

            <p><strong>Information Collected when You View a Presentation:</strong></p>
			<p>If you view a presentation as a registered SlideRocket user, by the invitation of a SlideRocket user or as a website guest, we may collect details about your viewing, including your name, contact information, IP address and geolocation information through your IP address (as described below). Additionally,  we may track certain details about your viewing experience such as how long you spent on each slide, how much time you spent on a presentation, whether or not you shared another user’s presentation, and whether or not you choose to use some of the slides in your own presentation. </p>

At your option, you may choose to create a shared distribution list and/or upload your address book and your contacts’ information in order to share your presentations with others (“guests”).  At your request, we may use guests’ contact information, including their name and email addresses, in order to invite them to view your presentations, to allow guests to respond to and comment on your presentations, and allow them to participate in interactive features that you choose to place into your presentations.  By providing us with your guests’ information, you are telling us that you are entitled to use and provide us with your guests’ name and contact information. </p>

			<p><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure:</strong></p>  
			<p>Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information and your presentations with the world. Most of the information that you provide us is information you are asking us to make public or share with other parties. This includes not only the presentations that you create on SlideRocket and the metadata provided with your presentations, but also information about the presentations you view, the people with whom you share your presentations, the presentations and slides that you mark as your favorites, and the presentations and slides that you repost or share on third party sites and applications.  SlideRocket generally gives you the option to make your presentations private. You may also limit those able to view and interact with your presentations, and you may choose to add additional privacy controls, such as protecting the privacy of your presentation with an invitation and a password.</p> 
			<p>Any information that you choose to make public may be broadly and instantly disseminated on a global level. SlideRocket allows you to share your presentations with others in a variety of ways, including: through email; by invitation; by sharing within your organization or school’s account; by setting the presentation as “public”; by creating or allowing others to access a public link attached to your presentation; by allowing others to add your presentations and slides to their accounts; by allowing others to collaborate and edit your presentation; by embedding or allowing others to embed your presentation in another website or blog; by collaborating with others in a meeting or web conference; by liking, pinning or tweeting a presentation; by posting your presentation or its link on a social media site or third party application; by publishing your presentation; by allowing others to share your presentation with their contacts; by allowing others to incorporate content and full slides from your presentation into their presentations and libraries; by tagging your presentation in order to help it become more searchable; by allowing others to download and/or print your presentation; by uploading your presentation to a third party online or cloud storage or sharing tool; and by allowing others to help you promote your presentations with various social media tools.</p>  
			<p>When you choose to share highly-personal, sensitive or confidential content, including photos, images, videos, links and geolocational information through SlideRocket’s Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public. </p>
			
			<p><strong>Location Information:</strong></p>
			<p>You may choose to publish your location in your presentations. Additionally, if you view another’s presentation, either as a registered user or as an anonymous guest, the presentation’s creator will be able to view the geographical area where you were located when you viewed the presentation (based upon your IP address).</p>
			
			<p><strong>Information that May Be Shared if You Link Your Account with a Third Party Application or Website:</strong></p>
			<p>If you embed or allow others to embed the link to your presentation on a third party website or application, then the information that you share with the third party application or site may be made publicly available in accordance with the third party’s privacy policy. Additionally, public information and public presentations may be searchable in SlideRocket’s application and may be indexed by third party search engines, such as Google. If you do not wish your information to be shared in the manner, please do not publicly publish your presentation and please carefully limit other’s ability to access and share your presentations in your account settings.</p> 
			<p>Additionally, If you connect a third party website or application account to SlideRocket’s Services, we may share your Social Media Information and Content, as well as your presentations, uploaded content, activities and comments within the Services, with other users of the Services and with your friends associated with your social media account.  We may also share the same information with your social media account provider.  By connecting your Services account with your third party account, you authorize us to share such information with your social media account provider, other users, and your friends and authorized contacts, and you understand that the use of the shared information will be governed by the third party site’s privacy policy. If you do not want your information shared in this way, please do not connect your social media account with your Services account and do not participate in social sharing from within the Services.</p>
			
			 <p><strong>Links to Non-SlideRocket Websites and Third Parties:</strong></p>
			<p>For your convenience and information, we may provide links to third-party websites and applications. If you access those sites and applications, you will leave SlideRocket’s Services. SlideRocket does not control those sites or applications or their privacy practices, which may differ from SlideRocket’s. We do not endorse or make any representations about third party websites or applications.  The personal data you choose to give to such third parties is not covered by SlideRocket’s Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policy before submitting your personal information to any third-party website or application. Some third-party companies may choose to share your personal data with SlideRocket, and that sharing is governed by that third party’s privacy policy. </p>
			
			<p><strong>Law and Harm:</strong></p>
			<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personal information with third parties without your permission. However, we may use, preserve and/or disclose your information as we believe to be necessary or appropriate:  (1) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (2) to comply with legal process; (3) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including authorities outside your country of residence; (4) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property and/or that of our affiliates, you or any other person; (5) to address fraud, security or technical issues and protect our operations or those of our affiliates; (6) to enforce SlideRocket’s Terms of Use, Terms of Service or Privacy Policy; and (7) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. </p>

			<p>In the event that SlideRocket is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock, your information may be sold or transferred as part of the transaction. </p>
			
			<p><strong>Co-Branded Partners:</strong></p>
			<p>Co-Branded Partners are third parties with whom SlideRocket may jointly offer a service or feature. If you register for or use such services, both SlideRocket and the third party may receive information in conjunction with the co-branded services. </p>
			
			<p><strong>Non-Personal Information: </strong></p>
			<p>We may use and disclose your non-private, aggregated or other non-personal information, including, without limitation, your presentations that you publicly publish, information collected from cookies, aggregated and statistical information (as described above), for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. We may combine the non-personal information we collect from and about you with personal information we have collected from you in different contexts, as well as with information we received from other sources.</p>
