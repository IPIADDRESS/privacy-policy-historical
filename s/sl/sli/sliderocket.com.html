    <p align="left">Thank you for visiting SlideRocket’s (“SlideRocket”) Internet web site  located at the URL www.sliderocket.com (“Site”). This Privacy Policy details  certain policies implemented throughout SlideRocket governing SlideRocket’s use  of personally identifiable information about users of our Site and users of our  services and/or software that is available for download on this Site.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="subheader">Privacy Policy Updates.</p>
    <p>Due to  the Internet’s rapidly evolving nature, SlideRocket may need to update this  Privacy Policy from time to time. If so,  SlideRocket will post our updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at http://www.sliderocket.com/privacypolicy.html  so you are always aware of what personally identifiable information we may  collect and how we may use this information. SlideRocket will also send  registered users of the Site e-mail notifications notifying such users of any  changes to the Privacy Policy. SlideRocket encourages you to review this  Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.&nbsp;Your continued use of this Site and/or continued provision of personally  identifiable information to us will be subject to the terms of the then-current  Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Information Collection and Use.</p>
    <p>You  can generally visit our Site without revealing any personally identifiable  information about yourself. However, in  certain sections of this Site and when you download any software we may offer, we may invite you to contact us with questions or comments or request  information or complete a profile or registration form. Due to the nature of some of these  activities, we may collect personally identifiable information such as your name,  e-mail address, password, organization and other contact information that you  voluntarily transmit with your communication to us. We also may collect information about you and  your use of our Site, services and/or software through your use of our Site,  services and/or software. When you  register for an account, we will collect your first and last name, e-mail  address, password and organization name and use this information to create a  user account where you can create, manage, access and share presentations and  other information that you post to the Site with other users of the Site that  you designate.</p>

    <p class="subheader">Cookies.</p>
    <p>We may  use small  files called cookies to improve overall Site experience. A  cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing  information about the user. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally  identify you.</p>

We may analyze this data  for trends and statistics in the aggregate, and we may use such aggregate  information to administer the Site, track users’ movement, and gather broad demographic  information for aggregate use.</p>
    <p class="subheader">Disclosure.</p>
    <p>We may  provide your personally identifiable information and the data generated by  cookies and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that  we may engage to assist us in providing our services to you. For example, we  may provide your personally identifiable information to a credit card  processing company to process your payment.&nbsp;  We will also disclose your personally identifiable information (a) only  if we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or  otherwise in cooperation with an ongoing investigation of a governmental  authority, (b) to enforce the SlideRocket Terms of Use agreement or to protect  our rights or (c) to protect the safety of users of our Site and our services.&nbsp; We will not sell your personally identifiable  information to any company or organization except we may transfer your  personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger,  consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which SlideRocket  participates or to a purchaser or acquirer of all or substantially all of SlideRocket’s  assets to which this Site relates. <strong></strong></p>
    <p class="subheader">Links to Third Party Sites.</p>
    <p>The  Site may provide links to other Web sites or resources over which SlideRocket  does not have control (“External Web Sites”).&nbsp;Such links do not constitute an endorsement by SlideRocket of those  External Web Sites.&nbsp; You acknowledge that  SlideRocket is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further  agree that SlideRocket is not responsible for the content of such External Web  Sites.

    <p>Our computer systems are  currently based in the United States,  so your personal data will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and  privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other  parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create a user account with the Site as  a visitor from outside the United States, by using the Site you agree to this  Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the  United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that  required in the European Union or certain other countries, and to the  processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>This Privacy  Policy was last updated: September 6, 2007<br>
      This  Privacy Policy is effective as of: September 6, 2007</p>
