<h1>Logitech's Privacy Policy</h1>
<p> As your privacy is important to us, Logitech has prepared this  privacy web page so that you may better understand how your personal  information is used in connection with Logitech´s online services.  Please take the time to review this page and contact us at  privacy@logitech.com with any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>This Statement of Privacy &amp; Security applies to Logitech´s  family of Web sites, customer telephone surveys, product registration  cards and customer support helpdesk communications and governs data  collection and usage at all of these Logitech sites and services.  Logitech provides a general audience web site. Personal information of  all users is collected, used and disclosed as described in this  Statement of Privacy &amp; Security. </p>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Collection of your Personal Information </span><br>
<br>
Logitech may ask you to register and provide personal information in  certain instances, such as when you purchase products from the  Specialty Store, download free software, register new products, enter a  contest or sweepstakes or sign into a page that requires authorization.  Logitech may also collect financial information to bill you for  products and services that you purchased online. <br>
<br>
This personal information may include your name, e-mail address, user  ID, address and telephone number. Logitech may also collect demographic  information, such as your age, gender, zip code/postal code, education  level, household income, preferences, interests, favorites and whether  you are a personal or business user. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Collection of Other Information </span><br>
<br>
System Configuration Information: <br>
<br>
Logitech automatically collects on our server logs certain information  about your computer hardware and software when you visit our Web site  or use Logitech´s online services, such as Logitech Desktop Messenger  (“LDM”). This information may include: your IP address, cookie  information, globally unique identifier system, operating system,  description of any Logitech products connected and how such products  are used, browser type, domain names, access times, service provider  and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by Logitech  to monitor the operation of our Web site and online services and the  use of its products, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide  general statistics regarding use of our products and our Web site. <br>
<br>
Tracking of Web Site Usage: <br>
<br>
Logitech also tracks the usage of visitors to our Web site, including  the URL of the visitor´s previous Web site and when they exit our Web  site. Logitech also keeps track of the pages our customers visit within  our Web site and any transaction details (downloads, orders, requests  or referrals) in order to determine what Logitech products, information  and services are the most popular. This data is also used by Logitech  to deliver customized content and advertising to customers whose  behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject  area. Logitech uses various technologies to track trends in the use of  our website or online services, including session cookies and GUIDs.  These allow us to track how consumers interact with Logitech online and  with your permission this information can be tied to your personal  information to help us tailor communication to you. <br>
<br>
Information for Using Harmony Remote Controls: <br>
<br>
If you use a Harmony Remote control or if you visit the  harmonyremote.com site, Logitech may also collect certain information  about your consumer electronic devices, as well as your device and/or  TV channel configurations in order to help you program your remote  control. <br>
<br>
Harmony Remote Control Users: In order to program your Harmony Remote  control, you will need to supply Logitech with complete information on  the Consumer Electronic Components that you wish to operate with your  Harmony Remote control. Such information may include the make, model  number, and set up of your Consumer Electronic Components. For example,  Logitech will need to know that your VCR is connected to your Stereo  Receiver and the video output is connected to Input 1 on your TV. If  you choose to withhold this information, then Logitech will not be able  to help you program your remote control. <br>
<br>
In the event that you are not able to locate a Consumer Electronic  Component´s make and model within Logitech´s existing database, you  will have two options to provide information for setting up your  Consumer Electronic Component. You may choose to match a similar make  and model from our existing database to check to see if such remote  control commands will work with your Consumer Electronic Component.  Alternatively, you may use the learning functions on the Harmony Remote  control to teach it your Consumer Electronic Component´s remote control  commands. In both situations, the set up information and the remote  control commands are transferred to the Harmony Remote database --  these remote control commands then become available to other customers  of Harmony Remote. <br>
<br>
In order to use your Harmony Remote control with your TV, you also need  to disclose to Logitech certain information related to what TV channels  are received at your location in order to properly program the remote  control with the available TV channels. You may also optionally  indicate your favourite TV channels, which may be programmed onto your  remote control. <br>
<br>
In order to provide you with support services for your Harmony Remote  control, Logitech will store your device set up information in its  database, as part of your account. This information is maintained to  enable you to download future TV listings, complete changes to your  account, complete updates with new versions of Harmony software, and to  assist Logitech with providing future customer support. This  information is also used for analytical purposes to help Logitech  improve its customer support. Further, Logitech may from time to time  use this information to contact you, conduct research, and offer  additional products and services to you. <br>
<br>
Test Drive on the harmonyremote.com Site: If you visit the  harmonyremote.com site and elect to take a test drive of a Harmony  Remote control, you will be asked to supply the make and model number,  as well as the product configuration or set up, of the various Consumer  Electronic Components that you wish to "test drive" with a Harmony  Remote control. Logitech will maintain your test drive account so that  if you later purchase a Harmony Remote Control, you can program it with  your test drive set up information. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Use of Your Information </span><br>
<br>
With your express permission, Logitech collects, integrates and uses  this personal and other information to help you quickly find software,  services or information on logitech.com, to help us create Web site  content and other services most relevant to you and to alert you to  product upgrades, special offers, newsletters, updated information and  other new services from Logitech. When Logitech receives information  about your session or about you, we may use it for research or to  improve our site and the services we offer you. We may also use this  information from time to time to monitor the technical functions of our  servers and site. Logitech uses this information to communicate with  you only after you give your express permission for such communication.  Logitech does not share this information with any third parties, except  with your consent or as described below. <br>
If you choose not to register and provide this information, you can  still use most of Logitech´s services. Unfortunately, you will not be  able to access areas that require registration. <br>
<br>
If you do not want logitech.com to send you e-mail or postal mail  regarding Logitech products or services, you may opt out when you  register by selecting the option stating that you do not wish to  receive such marketing materials from logitech.com by selecting the  option stating "Check here if you do not wish to receive Logitech  mailings". <br>
<br>
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our  behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings,  providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing  statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those  companies the personal information they need to deliver the service.  They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information  and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. <br>
<br>
We from time to time supplement the information we collect from the  site with information from offline or third party sources. We use this  information to enhance or overlay the ‘profile´ of customers and  business contact information. This supplementary data is therefore tied  to corporate contact information and in some cases personally  identifiable information. <br>
<br>
We also may internally compare lists collected from our other sites or  within our family of companies to remove duplicate entries. <br>
<br>
Personal information collected on this site may be stored and processed  in the United States or any other country in which Logitech or its  affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using  this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of  your country. Logitech abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth  by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and  retention of data from the European Union. <br>
<br>
Logitech will not disclose your personal information to any third party  without your approval, except that we reserve the right to disclose  your personal information: (a) to any of our affiliates, subsidiaries,  third party service providers or advisers that we deem appropriate; (b)  if such disclosure is made pursuant to a legal proceeding or as  required by law; (c) if necessary, to protect the personal safety of  users of Logitech´s web sites, or the public; (d) to protect and defend  the rights or property of Logitech, including its Web site; (e) to  another business entity should we plan to merge with, or be acquired by  that business entity; or (f) organizations involved in a merger,  transfer or sale of our assets or business. <br>
<br>
In the event that we disclose your personal information as set out of  above, we will require third party organizations who have access to  your personal information to protect and maintain your personal  information in compliance with the terms and conditions of this  Statement of Privacy &amp; Security. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Control of Your Personal Information</span><br>
<br>
Logitech offers its customers choices for the collection, use and  sharing of personal information at the time the customer decides to  register. In addition, you may also stop the delivery of future  communication from Logitech by unsubscribing at any time. For instance,  each email you receive contains instructions explaining how to stop  receiving such e-mails. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information </span><br>
<br>
If a user´s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip  code/postal code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no  longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or  delete/deactivate users´ personally identifiable information. This can  be done by emailing our Customer Support at  registration_requests@logitech.com. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Security of your Personal Information </span><br>
<br>
Logitech is committed to protecting the security of your personal  information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures  to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access,  use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you  provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in  controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information  (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through  the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information</span> <br>
<br>
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from  users under the age of 13. If for some reason we are made aware we have  such personal information we will take reasonable steps to delete that  information. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">USE OF COOKIES </span><br>
<br>
Like many other companies, Logitech uses cookies to help you  personalize your online experience. We use both session and persistent  cookies. A cookie is a very small text file placed on your hard drive  (with your permission) by a web page server. It is essentially your  identification card, and cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.  It is uniquely yours and can only be read by the server that gave it to  you. Cookies are used by Logitech to tailor content to your interests.  For example, when you initiate a response by clicking on a link within  an e-mail message, you are re-directed onto the Internet. We then  record your individual response to help us deliver information that is  more relevant to your interests. This saves you time as it helps  Logitech remember who you are. It makes your subsequent visits to  logitech.com simpler and more seamless. You can set your browser to  notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the opportunity to  decide whether or not to accept it. However, on some pages which  require authorization, cookies are not optional. If you choose not to  accept cookies, you will likely not be able to access these pages. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">USE OF GLOBALLY UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS </span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What is a GUID? </span><br>
<br>
A Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) is an alphanumeric identifier used  to indicate a unique installation of a product, and is found in many  popular software applications such as web browsers and media players.  Logitech may use GUIDs for aggregate statistical analysis, to  personalize products and services. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Logitech´s Use of GUIDS in LDM products and in future products </span><br>
<br>
LDM randomly generates a GUID during installation. Logitech uses  publicly documented standards to generate GUIDs. From time to time,  Logitech may use a GUID with a unique set of numbers in order to gather  and aggregate information about traffic patterns, such as how many  times a user attempts to access content from a server. These statistics  help us improve our services. <br>
<br>
We may collect data marked by Logitech GUIDs in order to understand  aggregated traffic patterns and other Logitech usage patterns. We use  this data in order to measure product performance, better understand  types of content that are popular with our users and how our products  are used and to conduct user surveys. We may relate GUID marked system  data to other personal information supplied by users. The system  information that is linked to your personal information is limited to  information about the types of Logitech products you have connected to  your computer. Further, consistent with our privacy principles,  Logitech does not sell or share such information with any third party  unless we obtain a user´s advance informed consent. <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><br>
USE OF E-MAIL MESSAGING </span><br>
<br>
Logitech will periodically send our registered users e-mail messages  about our products and services. When sending you e-mail, we may use an  image called a single pixel GIF that allows us to format messages  tailored to your computer´s capabilities. We also use this technology  to determine, in the aggregate, how many people open our e-mails. When  you initiate a response by clicking on a link within an e-mail, you are  redirected on to the Internet. We then record your individual response  to help us deliver information that is more relevant to your interests. <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><br>
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS STATEMENT OF PRIVACY </span><br>
<br>
Logitech, Inc. is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is  an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to enable  individuals and organizations to establish trusting relationships based  on respect for personal identity and information by promoting the use  of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site  www.logitech.com. Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to our  users´ privacy, we have agreed to disclose our privacy practices and  have them reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. <br>
<br>
If you have questions or complaints regarding this statement, you  should first contact us at privacy@logitech.com with any questions or  concerns. All customer complaints will be formally reviewed by  Logitech. <br>
<br>
If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry  has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe  at www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html in the US. TRUSTe will  serve as a liaison with Logitech to resolve your concerns. However,  please understand the TRUSTe program covers only information that is  collected through this Web site www.logitech.com, and does not cover  information that may be collected through software downloaded from the  site. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">CHANGES TO THIS STATEMENT </span><br>
<br>
Logitech will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy &amp;  Security. When Logitech posts changes to this Statement, you will see  the word "updated" next to the Privacy Statement link on the front page  of logitech.com. If there are material changes to this Statement or in  how Logitech will use your personal information, Logitech will  prominently post such changes prior to implementing the change;  however, we will not make any changes that are less protective of your  personal information collected in the past, without your consent.  Logitech encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be  informed of how Logitech is protecting your information. <br>
<br>
Thank you for your interest in Logitech and our products. <br>
