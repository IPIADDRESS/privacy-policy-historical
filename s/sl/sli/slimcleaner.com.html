            <br>
        To safeguard your privacy, every cookie assigned to a system that accesses our servers is non-unique and non-identifiable. All cookies distributed by SlimwareUtilities.com or by any Slimware Utilities subsidiary Web-service can be designated as secure and non-invasive by the following criteria: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The cookies are visible only to SlimWareUtilities.com</li>

        <li>The cookies are of a limited duration</li>        
        <li>The cookies contain no personally identifying information</li>
        <li>The cookies are not unique to a given computer system</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Slimware Utilities products use cookies to track affiliate sales.  They are NOT used to build customer profiles.

      <h1 class="txt-color">Security</h1>
      <p align="left">To protect your personally identifying information, we store all transaction records on servers with limited-access, meaning they are accessible only through encrypted means.

If one or more of these stated conditions is not applicable to your relationship with us, we delete the personally identifying information.</p>
      <h1 class="txt-color">How Collected Information is Used</h1>
      <p align="left">We may use information in the following ways: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To process, validate and verify purchases.</li>
        <li>To register you as a customer of a Slimware Utilities Product, namely SlimCleaner. This process facilitates the creation and maintenance of a customer support account on your behalf.</li>
        <li> To send out email notifications concerning existing products or new products and/or services. Emails are also sent out to notify you of special offers when such offers become available, and to contact you to confirm or verify (if needed) the accuracy of information provided to us.</li>

      </ul>
      We retain the right to disclose personally identifying information in special circumstances wherein it is necessary to protect our service or enforce our agreements.

      <h1 class="txt-color">Slimware Utilities Product Behavior</h1>
      <p align="left">Neither Slimware Utilities nor any of its subsidiary products, including SlimCleaner, collect personally identifying information from your computer. All Slimware Utilities products are equipped with a full-access install sequence and upon uninstallation, no Slimware Utilities product leaves any active or executable data on your computer. What is left is an inert, text-based log file.  This file is deposited in an accessible directory on your hard drive. It indexes events that have occurred in the course of using the Slimware Utilities product.  Such events include, but are not limited to, listing corrected errors. This file is left as a courtesy to our customers.  It can be easily deleted of so desired. If retained, it can be used by support technicians as a reference, whether or not those technicians are associated with Slimware Utilities.<br>
      </p>
      <h1 class="txt-color">Update Services</h1>
      <p align="left">All Slimware Utilities products routinely communicate with our server to get active feedback concerning application ratings.  This feedback constitutes either volunteered ratings of software or ongoing updates to the programs' respective databases.  These updates allow for better and more accurate optimization plans. The only personal data transmitted to the server in such a communication is the version of the software product (SlimCleaner) currently installed on your PC. The formation of a personalized customization profile is done locally and not on our servers.
	  
	  You have the option to discontinue automatic updates at any time.  This update process can be managed and/or disabled via the Settings dialog in the respective application. By default, the updates for Slimware Utilities products are downloaded only after you are notified of their availability and have subsequently given consent for download.</p>
      <h1 class="txt-color">Policy Modifications</h1>
