Except where we are required by law to disclose personal information, we will use reasonable efforts to require any person to whom we provide your personal information to agree to comply with our then current Privacy Policy.  However, to the extent allowed under applicable law, we will have no liability to you if any person fails to do so.</p>
        <p>To be able to serve you, your personal information may be collected, stored, and/or processed or otherwise used by or on our behalf both inside and outside of Canada and the United States by third party service providers, to perform cloud storage, payment processing and other functions on our behalf.  As a result, those country's courts, governments or law enforcement agencies could obtain disclosure of such information under such country's laws.</p>
        
        <h2>Individual Choice and Access</h2>
        <p>We do our best to keep your data accurate and up to date, to the extent that you provide us with the information we need to do that.  If your data changes (like a new email address or phone number), then you're responsible for notifying us of those changes.</p>
        <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as long as needed to provide you with the products or services that you have requested.  We may also retain and use your information in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent abuse, and enforce our agreements.  It is SlickText's policy to delete personal information about account holders and their users when their account is no longer active.</p>
        <p>We will provide an individual access to any personal information we hold about them within thirty (30) days of any request for that information.  Individuals may request this information from us by contacting us using the contact information provided above.  Unless it is prohibited by law, we will remove any personal information about an individual from our servers at their request.  There is no charge for an individual to access or update his or her personal information.</p>
        <p>It is SlickText's policy that, just as a user must opt in to a text messaging list, they have the right to opt out of a particular text messaging list as well.  When a user opts out of a text messaging list, they will no longer receive any texts from that particular list unless they, themselves, re-subscribe.  SlickText is not responsible for the text or picture messages sent by our clients or customers that are using SlickText products or services.  It is the sole responsibility of the SlickText clients to acquire proper permission to send text messages and/or MMS messages to their subscribers.</p>
        <p>Users can remove themselves from any client's SMS list at any time by texting "stop" along with the textword they signed up for.  Reply "stop all" to remove your number from all of SlickText's client's lists.</p>
        
        <h2>Anti-Spam Policy</h2>
        <p>SlickText requires its users to adhere to the Mobile Marketing Association's most current version of the policy document U.S. Consumer Best Practices for Messaging, found at http://www.mmaglobal.com/documents/us-consumer-best-practices, in addition to the CTIA Short Code Monitoring Handbook, which can be accessed through https://www.ctia.org/about-ctia/programs.

        <h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
        <p>We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to improve the convenience and efficiency of your experience when using our products and services.  A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive tied to statistical information about the user.  Usage of a cookie may be linked to an IP address of the user, but is not otherwise linked to any personally identifiable information in our services and email messages.</p>
        <p>We may also use tracking pixels (also known as clear gifs or web beacons), which are invisible 1x1 pixel images that are requested from a remote server via a url that typically contains small strings of encoded information, which may in part be determined by cookies.  When a tracking pixel is requested from a server, that server may decode and process this information, for example, storing it to server log files for future analysis.</p>
        <p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers or tracking utility companies) may use cookies on our Website.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.  For example, our Website utilizes Google Analytics, a common website analytics tool.  For more information about Google Analytics, please refer to the website, "How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps" at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.</p>
        <p>Our Website also utilizes Google AdSense, a common web advertising service.  Google AdSense uses cookies that are stored on your computer and allow an analysis of the use of the Website by you.  Google AdSense also uses web beacons to gather information.  Through the use of web beacons, simple actions such as visitor traffic to the Website can be recorded and collected. The information generated by the Google AdSense cookies and/or web beacons store information about your use of this Website, including your IP address.  Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the Website in order to show you relevant advertisements, compile reports on Website activity and ads for Website operators, and provide other internet related services.  Users may opt out of personalized Google advertising by visiting https://www.google.com/settings/ads/. </p>
        <p>Our Website may use Facebook pixels, which help us track conversions from Facebook ads, optimize ads based on collected data, build targeted audiences for future ads, and remarket to qualified leads.</p>
        <p>This site uses the following categories of cookies:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Strictly necessary cookies - these are cookies that are required for the operation of our website. They include, for example, a first part session-id, which identifies a user and stores the application servers to use for the user's session.</li>
            <li>Analytics &amp; customization cookies - these functional cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and applications for you in order to enhance your experience.</li>
            <li>Performance &amp; functionality cookies - these cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our website but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.</li>
            <li>You can always choose to not accept cookies, but you may not be able to use some of the Website services.  Users may visit the websites of those vendors listed above to opt out of the use of cookies for personalized advertising (if the vendor or ad network offers this capability). </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Online Tracking / Do Not Track</h2>
        <p>We do not track our visitors across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore we do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.  However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.  If you are visiting such sites, your internet browser may allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.</p>
        
        <h2>No Collection of Children's Personal Information</h2>
        <p>This Website is intended for audiences at least 18 years old.  We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.  We reserve the right to delete any information we believe to be in violation of this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>No Liability</h2>
        <p>You understand that electronic communications may be accessed by unauthorized parties when communicated across the Internet, network communications facilities, or other electronic means.  You agree that we are not responsible for any electronic communication and/or any of your data which may be lost, altered, intercepted or stored without authorization during the transmission of any data whatsoever across networks not owned and/or operated by us.

        <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy and to our information gathering and dissemination practices.
