<div class="regtext">This Privacy Policy describes Slothster's policies and procedures on the collection, use and 
disclosure of your information. Slothster receives your information through our various web 
sites, services and third-parties ("Services"). When using any of our Services you consent 
to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information 
as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country that you reside in or create 
information from, your information may be used by Slothster in the United States or any other 
country where Slothster operates.</div>
<div class="regtext">If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via the 
"Contact Us" form located <a href="./contact" target="_blank">here</a>.</div>
<div class="heading">Information Collection and Use</div>
<div class="imptext">Information Collected Upon Registration:</div>
<div class="regtext">When you create or update your Slothster account, 
you provide some personal information, such as your chosen username, password, and email address. 
Some of this information, for example, your username, is listed publicly on our Services, including 
on your profile page.</div>
<div class="imptext">Additional Information:</div>
<div class="regtext">You may provide us with additional information to make public, 
such as a short biography, your location, or a picture. We may use your contact information to 
send you important notifications about our Services. If you email us, we may keep your message, 
email address and contact information to respond to your request. Providing the additional information 
described in this section is entirely optional.</div>
<div class="imptext">Additional Public Information:</div>
<div class="regtext">Our Services are primarily designed to help you interact with 
Slothster Services and provide social interaction with other users from around the world. Most of the 
information you provide to us is information you are allowing us to make public. This includes not 
only the comments you leave on content and other profiles and the metadata provided when posting, 
such as the time and date of submission, but also the people you add as friends, the content you add 
as a favorite and many other bits of information. By default most of the information you provide is 
made public, however your email address, unless you explicitly share it, shall always remain private. 
Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For example, comments you post on content 
are searchable by many search engines and are available to a wide range of users and services. You 
should be careful about all information that you share that will be made public by Slothster, since 
what you post may be viewed all around the world instantly.</div>
<div class="imptext">Log Data:</div>
<div class="regtext">Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the 
Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain, 
pages visited, and search terms. Other actions, such as interactions with other members and Slothster 
content, may also be included in Log Data. Log Data is never disclosed to third parties and is used 
to analyze usage and continually improve our Services by ensuring all representative configurations are 
addressed.</div>
<div class="imptext">Cookies:</div>
<div class="regtext">Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data 
and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as looking 
at public user profiles. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. 
Slothster may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with 
our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to 
improve our Services. We do use session cookies to confirm that you are logged into Slothster, and you can 
instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting 
a cookie from the websites you visit, however in some cases that may impact your ability to use Slothster.
</div>
<div class="imptext">Third Party Services:</div>
<div class="regtext">Slothster uses a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide 
our Services and to help us understand the use of our Services. These services may collect information 
sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP request, however we do not 
disclose your private information to these third party services except in the limited circumstances 
described below.</div>
<div class="heading">Information Sharing and Disclosure</div>
<div class="imptext">Your Consent:</div>
<div class="regtext">We may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as when you use 
a third party web client to access your Slothster account.</div>
<div class="imptext">Google Display Network:</div>
<div class="regtext">Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on Slothster. 
Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to users based on their visit to Slothster and 
other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and 
content network privacy policy located at <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/" target="_blank">
http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/</a>.</div>
<div class="imptext">Service Providers:</div>
<div class="regtext">We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide 
services to us. We may share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent 
necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring 
the protections of this privacy policy.</div>
<div class="imptext">Law and Harm:</div>
<div class="regtext">We may disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to 
comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, 
security or technical issues; or to protect Slothster's rights or property.</div>
<div class="imptext">Business Transfers:</div>
<div class="regtext">In the event that Slothster is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, 
reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. 
The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</div>
<div class="imptext">Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:</div>
<div class="regtext">We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or 
otherwise non-personal information, such as your comments on content or public profile information.</div>
<div class="heading">Modifying Your Personal Information</div>
<div class="regtext">If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools to access or modify the personal 
information you provided to us and associated with your account.</div>
<div class="heading">Our Policy Towards Children</div>
<div class="regtext">Our Services are not directed to people under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with 
personal information without your consent, please contact us as soon as possible using the Contact Us form 
by clicking <a href="./contact" target="_blank">here</a>. We do not knowingly collect personal information 
from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, 
we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.</div>
<div class="heading">Third party links</div>
<div class="regtext">Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on Slothster. 
These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies and it is highly recommended you 
review their privacy policies which may differ from ours. Due to the fact we do not operate or control 
these sites, we cannot bear responsibility or liability for the content, activities, or policies of these 
linked sites. Nonetheless, we do seek to protect the integrity of Slothster and welcome any feedback about 
these sites. Feedback can be submitted by using the "Contact Us" form linked <a href="./contact" target="_blank">
here</a> for your convenience.</div>
<div class="heading">Changes to this Policy</div>
<div class="regtext">We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our 
use of your information and will always be at <a href="./privacy" target="_blank">http://www.slothster.com/privacy</a>. 
By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by 
the revised Privacy Policy.</div>
