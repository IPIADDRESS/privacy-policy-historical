We may use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personally identifiable information, for various purposes.</p> <h2>Collection of Personal Information</h2> <p>We collect Personal Information that our users provide to us in a variety of ways through our Services, including:</p> <p></p><ul> <li><i>E-mail Newsletters</i>.

By doing this, you authorize us to access and store the credentials you provide, your name, email address(es), date of birth, gender, current city, and other information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, including all Personal Information and other information relating to your customers, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means with Personal Information, or if applicable laws require us to treat any information gathered through passive means as Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, we use and disclose information collected by passive means in aggregate form or otherwise in a non-personally identifiable form.</li> <li>Also, please be aware that third parties, such as companies displaying advertisements on the Service, or sites or services provided by third parties (“Third-Party Sites”) that may be linked to or from the Service, may set cookies on your hard drive or use other means of passively collecting information about your use of their services, Third-Party Sites or content. We do not have access to, or control over, these third-party means of passive data collection.</li> </ul><p></p> <h2>Use of your Personal Information</h2> <p>We use Personal Information that we have collected in several ways, including:</p> <p></p><ul> <li>Company collects and uses your Personal Information and the Personal Information of others you have provided to us to operate the Website and deliver the Services you have requested.</li> <li>Company may also use your Personal Information to inform you of other products or services available from Company and its affiliates.

All such third parties are prohibited from using your Personal Information except to provide these services to Company, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your Personal Information.</li> <li>Company will also disclose your Personal Information, without notice, if required to do so by any applicable laws, rules, regulations, codes and or guidelines or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Company or the Services; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Company; (c) the enforcement of our agreements; and, (d) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services, or the public.</li> <li>Company may disclose Personal Information to third-party service providers (e.g., value-added resellers, payment processors, data storage and processing facility vendors) that assist us in our work. We limit the Personal Information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and we require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality of such Personal Information.</li> <li>Information about our users, including Personal Information, may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, or successor or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which Personal Information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.</li> </ul><p></p> <h2>Use of Cookies</h2> <p>The Website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p> <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Company pages, or register with the Website or Services, a cookie helps the Website to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information. When you return to the same Company website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Website features that you customized.</p> <p>We may also rely on or permit third-party companies to display ads tailored to your interests on third-party websites. These third-party companies may deliver ads that might also place cookies and otherwise track user behavior on the Website. Each of these companies uses the information it collects according to its own privacy and security policies. If you wish to not have this information used by third parties for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" rel="nofollow">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a> to opt-out.</p> <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Website or Services.</p> <h2>Security of your Personal Information</h2> <p>Company secures your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We use reasonable security measures that are designed to protect Personal Information from accidental loss, disclosure, misuse, and destruction. Please be aware, however, that no data security measures can be guaranteed to be completely effective. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you provide to us. You transmit information to us at your own risk. You are responsible for all Personal Information submitted through your account or user profile and all actions taken through your account and user profile.</p> <h2>International Visitors</h2> <p>Our servers and data centers may not be located in the same country from which you access our Services. If you choose to use the Services, then you should know that you may be transferring your Personal Information outside of your region and into other countries, which might include the United States, for storage and processing. By providing your Personal Information to us through your use of the Services, you agree to that transfer, storage, and processing outside of your jurisdiction. Also, we may transfer your data from other countries, including the United States, to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Services. You should know that each region can have its own privacy and data security laws, some of which may be less stringent as compared to those of your own region.</p> <h2>Children Under Thirteen</h2> <p>Our Terms of Use prohibit users of the Services who are under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13 on our Services, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
