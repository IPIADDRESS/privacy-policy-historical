<h1>Salt Lake County Library System Online Privacy Statement</h1>

</center>

<p>The Salt Lake County Library System ensures that all personally identifiable

information that it receives via the Internet, such as your library card

number, is secure against unauthorized access. Personally identifiable

information that you send from our online public access catalogs or from our

online forms is kept in a safe and secure system isolated from direct

connection to the Internet. When you type in your library card number it is

encrypted so that it cannot be recognized by others.</p>

<p>We collect IP addresses to obtain aggregate information on the use of the

Salt Lake County Library System Web Pages. An IP address is a number assigned

to your computer by a Web server when you are on the Web. When you visit our

site, a server logs your computer's IP address. We use only the information we

find out from tracking IP addresses in the aggregate, such as how many users

entered a specific area of our site, and not to track a specific IP address to

identify an individual user. However, we may use such information to identify a

user if we feel that there are or may be potential safety and/or security

issues.</p>
