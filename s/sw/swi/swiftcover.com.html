        <li>to other companies who provide a service to us or you (which includes proof of No Claims Discount (NCD) entitlement),

    <p>
        Disclosure of your information to a third party outside of the AXA Group will only be made where the third party has agreed to keep
         your information strictly confidential and use it only for the specific purpose for which we provide it to them. 
    </p>
    <p>We may transfer your information to other countries including those located outside the European Economic Area. If we do this we will

    <p><strong>Swiftcover RewarDrive app</strong></p>
    <p>
        Following the purchase of your private car insurance policy, we will offer you the opportunity to use a free smartphone telematics 
        application to assess your driving. If you download and use the app, technical information relating to driving performance is 
        stored and analysed by AXA and its third party service provider, Wejo. This data will be used by AXA to calculate your 
        driving score and provide other performance information, where you make a claim and in the investigation of insurance fraud. 
        <br>
        Full terms and conditions regarding use of the app are provided within the app.

    <h2>
        Using your online account</h2>
    <p>
        When you set up your first Swiftcover policy, you need to set up an online account (My Swift Space). In My Swift Space, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>view and print all your policy information and documents;</li>
        <li>securely make changes to your policy yourself whenever you want.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To set up and use My Swift Space, you'll need:
    </p>
   <ul>
        <li>your email address, which you give us when you buy your policy; </li>
        <li>a memorable password which you can choose; and </li>
        <li>to answer an additional security question when you first set up your account.</li>
    </ul>
   
    <p>
       By using the same email address when buying additional Swiftcover policies, your new documents will be stored to your existing online 
       account. You can then view all your details in the same Swiftcover account. If you prefer your new policy to be saved in a different 
       online account, you will need to use a different email address. </p>
  
    <p>
       We recommend that you do not share your account details with anyone. If you do give your email address and password to another person, 
       they will have all your privileges, and will be able to view or change your cover or details. In these instances you will be 
       responsible for their actions, and we cannot accept any responsibility for any adjustment made without your authority. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Because circumstances can change, you should review your access details regularly to make sure they are still appropriate for you and anyone 
        you have given permission to access your account. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To setup up a separate account for one or more of your existing policies, please contact our <a class="boldlink" href="/Contact/">help team</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If weâ€™re contacted by phone we wonâ€™t discuss the policy with anybody other than the policyholder unless we already have their 
        explicit consent. See <a class="boldlink" href="#dealingwithotherpeople">Dealing with other people</a> below.

       Preventing and detecting fraud</h2>
    <p>
        To help keep premiums low we do participate in a number of industry initiatives to prevent and detect fraud. To help prevent crime we may at any time: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>approach the DVLA to check all or any relevant driving licence details of anyone named on the policy;</li>
        <li>share information about you with other organisations and public bodies including the police;</li>
        <li>share information about you and any other named persons on the policy within the AXA Group and with other insurers;</li>
        <li>pass the details you have supplied to recognised centralised insurance industry applications, policy and claims checking systems (for example, the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, CUE, CIFAS and all DVLA databases) where those details will be checked and updated;</li>
        <li>load your details and any information or documents you provide us to the Insurance Fraud Register. This may affect future applications for insurance products.</li>
        <li>check the details you have supplied with fraud prevention agencies and databases including publicly available data (for example on County Court Judgements, bankruptcy information and electoral role data). If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, 
        details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies to prevent fraud and money laundering;</li>
        <li>periodically search records held by fraud prevention and credit reference agencies to: 
            <ul>
                <li>help make decisions about credit services for your and your financial associates;</li>
                <li>help make decisions on insurance policies and claims for you and your financial associates;</li>
                <li>trace people who owe money, recover debt, prevent fraud and to manage your insurance policies;</li>
                <li>check your identity to prevent money laundering;</li>
                <li>carry out credit searches, electoral roll searches and further fraud searches.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
           
    </ul>
    <p>
        For more information about the agencies with which we share your data, including further details explaining how the information held by fraud prevention agencies may be used, 
        please email us at <a class="boldlink" href="mailto:informationsharing@swiftcover.com">informationsharing@swiftcover.com</a>.

   <h2>
      Credit and other searches 
   </h2>
   <p>
       We make searches about you at credit reference agencies who will supply us with information, including information from the Electoral Register and credit information. The agencies may record details of the search whether 
       or not this application proceeds. 
   </p>
   <p>
       We may use scoring methods to assess this application, to verify your identity and determine finance charges. Searches and other 
       information which is provided to us and/or the credit reference agencies, about you and those with whom you are linked financially 
       may be used by us if you, or other members of your household, apply for other facilities including insurance applications and claims. 
       This information may also be used for debt tracing and the prevention of money laundering as well as the management of your account. 
   </p>
   <p>
      We may share the personal data of any persons named on the policy with third parties to obtain information which may be used by AXA to 
      inform its risk selection, pricing and underwriting decisions.

    <h2>
        Motor Insurance Database</h2>
    <p>
        When you take out a car insurance policy, your policy details will be added to the
        Motor Insurance Database ("MID"), run by the Motor Insurers' Information Centre
        ("MIIC"). MID data may be used by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the
        Driver and Vehicle Licensing Northern Ireland for the purpose of electronic vehicle
        licensing and by the police for the purposes of establishing whether a driver's
        use of a vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor insurance policy and for preventing
        and detecting crime. If you are involved in an accident, whether in the UK or abroad,
        other UK insurers, the Motor Insurers' Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to obtain
        relevant policy information.</p>
    <p>
        Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens
        of other EU countries) may be entitled to access relevant information held about
        you on the MID. You can find out more about this from us, or from the <a class="boldlink" href="http://www.MIIC.org.uk" target="_blank">Motor Insurance Bureau</a>.</p>

    <h2>
        Consent</h2>
    <p>
        You must have the consent of any named person on the policy to pass on their information 
        (including any sensitive personal information such as criminal convictions or medical information) to us.
    </p>
   <p>
        We do not intentionally collect any information from children under 16 years of age, and unless the information 
        was collected in connection with a policy claim, shall delete the details when a parent or guardian notifies us that 
        details have been obtained from their child.

        Dealing with other people</h2>
    <p>
        Data protection rules mean that we are only allowed to talk to the policyholder about anything to do with their insurance 
        â€“ unless they have named an alternative contact (such as a relative) to speak with us on their behalf. 
    </p>
        <dl>
        <dt>How to name an alternative contact</dt>
        <dd>
            If you took out or renewed your insurance after 24 June 2014, you can <a href="https://secure.swiftcover.com/privatedomain/">
                log in to your online account</a> and add an alternative contact to your policy
            yourself. If your policy was set up before then, please <a class="boldlink" href="/contact/call-us/">
                contact our help team</a> to name an alternative contact.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        Once you have told us your alternative contact, this person will be able to discuss
        all aspects of your policy (including claims) with us and make changes on your behalf
        except to cancel your policy or decline a renewal.</p>
    <p>
        In some exceptional circumstances we may also deal with other people who contact
        us on behalf of the policyholder.</p>
    <p>
        We will not reveal any credit or debit card numbers to anyone other than the policyholder.</p>

    <h2>
       Automatic renewals</h2>
    <p>
        Most Swiftcover policyholders benefit from the convenience of our automatic renewal service. Around 25 days before your 
        renewal date weâ€™ll email you your renewal invitation, which will also be stored in your My Swift Space online account for 
        you to view or amend. If the coverâ€™s right for you for another year, you donâ€™t need to do anything. Itâ€™s the hassle-free way 
        of keeping great value Swiftcover insurance. If you do not want to renew, just <a class="boldlink" href="/contact/">contact us</a> before your policy expiry date. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
    <p>
        We securely retain your payment details and if you donâ€™t contact us we will renew your policy automatically for you.
        You can of course use your Swiftcover Account to adjust your policy details and renew online or contact us if you have any questions.
