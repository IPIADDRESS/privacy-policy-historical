		</p><h2>Motor Insurance Database</h2>  
		When you take out a car insurance policy, your policy details will be added to  the Motor Insurance Database ("MID"), run by the Motor Insurers' Information Centre ("MIIC"). MID data may be used by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing  Agency and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Northern Ireland for the purpose of electronic vehicle licensing and by the police for the purposes of establishing whether a driver's use of a vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor insurance policy and for preventing and detecting crime. If you are involved in an accident,  whether in the UK or abroad, other UK insurers, the Motor Insurers' Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to obtain relevant policy information.<br>
		<br>
		Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens  of other EU countries) may be entitled to access relevant information held about  you on the MID. You can find out more about this from us, or from the <a class="boldlink" href="http://www.MIIC.org.uk" target="_blank">Motor Insurance Bureau</a>.<br>
