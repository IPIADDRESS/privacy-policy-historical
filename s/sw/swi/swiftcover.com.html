        How we use your information and who we share it with</h2>
    <p>
        Your privacy is important to us and we promise we will respect your personal information.
        We will use your information to manage your insurance with us, including underwriting,
        claims handling, No Claims Discount entitlement and statistical analysis. This may include 
        disclosing your information within the <a class="boldlink" href="/about/axa/" rel="nofollow">AXA Group</a> 
        and to agents, suppliers, other insurers, or reinsurers who provide services on our behalf.</p>
    <p>
        <br>
        We do not disclose your information to anyone outside the AXA Group except:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Where we have your permission; or</li>
        <li>Where we are required or permitted to do so by law; or</li>
        <li>To other companies who provide a service to us or you which includes proof of No Claims Discount (NCD) entitlement; or</li>
        <li>Where we may transfer rights and obligations under this agreement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We may transfer your information to other countries including those located outside

        whom we pass it provides an adequate level of protection.

    <h2>
        Using your online account</h2>
    <p>
        When you setup your first policy with Swiftcover, you need to set up an online account
        (My Swift Space). In My Swift Space, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>View and print all your policy information and documents</li>
        <li>Securely make changes to your policy yourself whenever you want</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To set up and use My Swift Space, you'll need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your email address, which you give us when you buy your policy </li>
        <li>A memorable password which you can choose</li>
        <li>To answer an additional security question when you first set up your account</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        By using the same email address when buying additional Swiftcover policies, your
        new documents will be stored to your existing online account. You can then view
        all your details in the same Swift Space. If you prefer you new policy to be saved
        in a different online account, you will need to use a different email address.
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend that you do not share your account details with anyone. If you do give
        your email address and password to another person, they will have all your privileges,
        and will be able to view or change your cover or details. In these instances you
        will be responsible for their actions, and Swiftcover cannot accept any responsibility
        for any adjustment made without your authority.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because circumstances can change, you should review your access details regularly
        to make sure they are still appropriate for you and anyone you have given permission
        to access your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        To setup up a separate account for one or more of your existing policies, please
        contact our <a href="/contact/">help team</a>.</p>
    <p>
        If weâ€™re contacted by phone we wonâ€™t discuss the policy with anybody other than
        the policyholder unless we already have their explicit consent. See <a class="boldlink" href="#P13">Dealing with other people</a> below.</p>

    <h2>
        Fraud prevention agencies</h2>
    <p>
        To keep premiums low we do participate in a number of industry initiatives to prevent
        and detect fraud. To help prevent crime we may at any time:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Approach the DVLA to check all or any relevant driving licence details of anyone
            named on the policy;</li>
        <li>Share information about you with other organisations and public bodies including
            the police;</li>
        <li>Share information about you and any other named drivers on the policy within the
            AXA Group and with other insurers;</li>
        <li>Pass the details you have supplied to recognised centralised insurance industry
            applications, policy and claims checking systems (for example the Motor Insurance
            Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, CUE, CIFAS and all DVLA databases) where those details
            will be checked and updated.</li>
        <li>Check the details you have supplied with fraud prevention agencies and databases
            including publicly available data (for example on County Court Judgements, bankruptcy
            information and electoral role data). If false or inaccurate information is provided
            and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies to
            prevent fraud and money laundering;</li>
        <li>Periodically search records held by fraud prevention and credit reference agencies
            to:
            <ul>
                <li>help make decisions about credit services for you and your Financial Associates</li>
                <li>help make decisions on insurance policies and claims for you and your Financial
                    Associates;</li>
                <li>trace debtors, recover debt, prevent fraud and to manage your insurance policies</li>
                <li>check your identity to prevent money laundering.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For more information about the agencies with which we share your data, including
        further details explaining how the information held by fraud prevention agencies
        may be used, please email us at <a href="mailto:informationsharing@swiftcover.com">informationsharing@swiftcover.com</a>.

    <ul>
        <li>Share your information across the AXA Group, with other insurers and, where we are
            entitled to do so under the Data Protection Act, the police and other law enforcement

            including publicly available data (for example on County Court Judgements, bankruptcy

            prevent fraud and money laundering;</li>
        <li>We and other organisations may also use and search these records to:

        Motor Insurance Database</h2>
    <p>
        When you take out a car insurance policy, your policy details will be added to the
        Motor Insurance Database ("MID"), run by the Motor Insurers' Information Centre
        ("MIIC"). MID data may be used by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the
        Driver and Vehicle Licensing Northern Ireland for the purpose of electronic vehicle
        licensing and by the police for the purposes of establishing whether a driver's
        use of a vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor insurance policy and for preventing
        and detecting crime. If you are involved in an accident, whether in the UK or abroad,
        other UK insurers, the Motor Insurers' Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to obtain
        relevant policy information.</p>
    <p>
        Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens
        of other EU countries) may be entitled to access relevant information held about
        you on the MID. You can find out more about this from us, or from the <a class="boldlink" href="http://www.MIIC.org.uk" target="_blank">Motor Insurance Bureau</a>.</p>
