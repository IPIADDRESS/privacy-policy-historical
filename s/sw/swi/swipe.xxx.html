    9. <strong>Do Not Track Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in your
    browser. DNT is a way for you to inform websites and services that you do
    not want certain information about your webpage visits collected over time
    and across websites or online services. The Company is committed to
    providing you with meaningful choices about the information it collects and
    that is why the Company provides you the ability to opt out. However, the
    Company does not recognize or respond to any DNT signals as the Internet
    industry works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to
    comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. For more
information, visit    <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com">www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.
