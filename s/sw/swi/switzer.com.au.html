<h5>Our commitment to protect your privacy</h5>

<p>Switzer seeks to provide the best possible service to its customers.</p>

<p>We understand how important it is to protect your personal information. This document sets out our privacy policy commitment in respect of personal information that you may provide to us.</p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy ensures your right to privacy as we recognise that any personal information we may collect about you will only be used for the purposes indicated in our policy. It is important to us that you are confident that any personal information we collect from you or is received by us, will be treated with appropriate respect ensuring protection of your personal information.</p>

<p>Our commitment in respect of personal information is to abide by the National Privacy Principles for the protection of personal information, as set out in the Privacy Act of Australia and any other relevant law.</p>

<h5>Personal information</h5>
<p>When we refer to personal information we mean information that we directly collect from you, from which your identity is apparent. This information may include information or an opinion about you, from which your identity can reasonably be ascertained.</p>

<h5>Why we collect your personal information</h5>
<p>We collect and receive personal information from our customers, affiliates and partners or from other organisations in order to conduct our business. From time to time we may offer other products and services.</p>

<p>To enable us to maintain a successful business relationship with you, we may disclose your personal information with other organisations that provide products or services used or marketed by us.</p>

<p>The types of organisations to which we are likely to disclose information about you include credit card processors, banks and financial institutions, freight companies and couriers, market research and advertising agencies, business advisors, accountants and lawyers. We may also disclose your personal information to any other organisation that may have or is considering having an interest in our business.</p>

<p>We may use your personal information for statistical and marketing analysis purposes; and research and development purposes.</p>

<h5>How do we collect your personal information?</h5>

<h5>To whom will we disclose your personal information?</h5>
<p>Where possible, we will inform you, at or before the time of collecting your personal information, the types of organisations that we intend to disclose your personal information to.</p>

<p>Sometimes we are required or authorised by law to disclose your personal information. Circumstances in which we may disclose your personal information would be to a Court or Tribunal in response to a request or in response to a subpoena or to the Australian Taxation Office.</p>

<p>We may collect details from or disclose your personal information to credit or fraud agencies or debt recovery agencies for verification or debt collection purposes.</p>

<p>We may also disclose your personal information to our professional advisors, including our accountants, auditors and lawyers, or to other organisations involved in sale or transfer of our assets.</p>

<h5>Direct marketing</h5>
<p>From time to time we may use your personal information to provide you with current information about our services, special offers you may find of interest, changes to our organisation, or new products or services being offered by us or any company we are associated with, seminars, and conventions.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to receive marketing information, you may at any time decline to receive such information by contacting our offices, by email to info@switzer.com.au, by following the instructions for removal in the marketing information or by writing to us at Suite 2 Level 1 36-40 Queen St Woollahra, NSW, Australia.

<h5>Updating your personal information</h5>
<p>It is important to our relationship that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and up to date. During the course of our relationship with you we will ask you to inform us if any of your personal information has changed.</p>

<h5>Denied access to personal information</h5>

<p>An explanation will be provided to you, if we deny you access to your personal information we hold.

</p><h5>Business without identifying you</h5>
<p>In most circumstances it will be necessary for us to identify you in order to successfully do business with you, however, where, it is lawful and practicable to do so, we will offer you the opportunity of doing business with us, without providing us with personal information. Such a situation would be where you make general inquiries about our services or current promotional offers.</p>
