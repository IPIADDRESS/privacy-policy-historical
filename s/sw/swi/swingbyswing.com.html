            Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet
            as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet's
            vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy
            and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects information
            from all end users of our Internet services (the "Services")-those who
            access some of our Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors") as well
            as those who may purchase Products and/or pay a monthly service fee to subscribe
            to the Service ("Members")-what we do with the information we collect,
            and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such
            information. We request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <b>Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used</b><br>
            <br>
            Introduction. Our company collects information in different ways from Visitors and
            Members who access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites
            accessible through our Service. We use this information primarily to provide a customized
            experience as you use our Products and Services, and generally, do not share this
            information with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected
            if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances,
            such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special
            cases described below.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Registration:&nbsp; Members may be asked to provide certain personal information
            when they sign up for our Products or Services including name, address, telephone
            number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal
            computer being used to access the Services. The personal information collected from
            Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account
            (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with third parties,
            unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances.
            <br>
            &nbsp;However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our
            Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name,
            address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the
            joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the
            results of the promotion.&nbsp;
            <br>
            In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other
            purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal
            information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not
            the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated
            and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Our Company Partners and Sponsors:&nbsp; Some products and services may be offered
            to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contractor
            seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members some of these
            products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal information.
            In these instances, you will be notified before any such data is collected or transferred
            and may decide not to use that particular service or feature.&nbsp;
            <br>
            Additionally, our partners may have advertisements or co-branded Web Pages that
            are cosponsored by an affiliate, independent contractor seller, or non-affiliated
            partner. Our company may share non-identifying and aggregate information (except
            as described above), but not personal information, with such partners in order to
            administer the co-branded products or services offered.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Online Shopping:&nbsp; At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services
            or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new product and
            service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information,
            such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card information.&nbsp;
            <br>
            If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly
            to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such
            as the recipient's name, address, and phone number. Our company has no control
            over the third parties' use of any personal information you provide when placing
            such an order. Please exercise care when doing so.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            If you order services or products directly from our company we will use the personal
            information you provide only to process that order. We do not share this information
            with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Online Advertisements:&nbsp; Our company may display our online advertisements.
            In those cases we share aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors
            and Members collected through the registration process as well as through online
            surveys and promotions with these advertisers.&nbsp;
            <br>
            Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying information
            to deliver tailored advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser
            or joint venture company tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us
            an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying
            information we have collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to
            the intended audience. Our company does not share personal information about its
            Visitors or Members with these advertisers or joint venture companies.<br>
            <br>
            Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to our
            company, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive.
            Our company does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does
            not share the return email address with any third party.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Voluntary Customer Surveys:&nbsp; We may periodically conduct both business and
            individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these
            surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve
            the types of products and services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your
            personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the
            survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer
            Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may
            have, to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender,
            age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic
            information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our
            services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally
            identifying information may be shared with third parties.<br>
            <br>
            Special Cases:&nbsp; It is our company's policy not to use or share the personal
            information about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above
            without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such
            unrelated uses.&nbsp;
            <br>
            However, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information
            regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services,
            for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do
            so, including: credit agencies, collection agencies, merchant database agencies,
            law enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy
            Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests
            for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact,
            or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy
            or Terms Of Service, or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or
            to protect our company and our Members.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            "Cookies" and How Our Company Uses Them. A "cookie" is a small
            data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain Web sites.
            Our company may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for
            statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to manage
            our telecommunications networks.&nbsp;
            <br>
            If you are a Visitor or Member we may use a cookie to save your settings and to
            provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third
            parties to access any of your customer information. Additionally, be aware that
            if you visit other Web sites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable,
            you may be required to accept cookies.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of
            these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through
            them.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>

            is especially important to us. It is our policy to comply with the Children's
