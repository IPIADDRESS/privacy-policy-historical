<p><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>We collect the following kinds of information:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>App Account and Profile Information:</strong>&nbsp;When you register with us through the Application or Sites to become a registered User, we will ask you for certain information about you that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”). PII may include, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>– Your first and last name</p>
<p>– Your email address and your desired password</p>
<p>– Your gender</p>
<p>– Your subscription preferences (whether and what types of information you would like us to send you)</p>
<p>If you create an App Account using your login credentials from one of your SNS Accounts, such as Twitter or Facebook, we’ll be able to access and collect certain information like your name, username, profile photograph and email address and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. You may provide us with additional profile information, including a short biography, location, and profile photo. If you create your App Account by connecting through another SNS Account, we may use public information from that connected account to help complete your App profile. Some contact information may be required in order to use certain features on the Services. We may also collect certain information that is not PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.</p>
<p><strong>Communications and Customer Service: </strong>We use your Personal Information to contact you with Swing by Swing newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your “preferences” information in your account settings. We use your Personal Information to respond to your questions or inquiries.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising: </strong>We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our web sites. These companies may utilize cookies, pixels or other technologies to collect and use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., hashed data, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance at: www.aboutads.info and Networking Advertising Initiative at http://www.networkadvertising.org/about-nai/about-nai.</p>
<p><strong>Finding Friends and Connecting to Other Services:</strong>&nbsp;Our Service includes several features to help connect you to people you already know. For example, at your direction, we may access information from your address book or connect your App Account to your other SNS Account and access your PII and non-PII from the third party services or our Service in order to enable you to find, connect, and message friends.</p>
<p><strong>Content, Following, and other Public Information:</strong>&nbsp;The App invites users to share User Content with the community, so the User Content you provide us is information that you choose to be made public. This includes not only the User Content that you post and metadata provided with such User Content (such as when it was posted, hashtags, and geotags), but also the people you follow or connect with, the Content that you like or comment on, and other public interactions on the Services. Your profile, including your name, username, photograph and any other information you provide on your profile, will also be accessed and viewed by the public in general. When you share information or User Content via the Service, you should exercise discretion and good judgment because the information and User Content may not be removed or deleted from the Service.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Messaging Other Users:</strong>&nbsp;When you send or receive messages, we collect, process and store the content of those messages (including photos and videos) on our servers. The contents of those messages may also be stored on the devices of recipients. We cannot prevent others from making copies of your messages (e.g., by taking a screenshot). In addition, there may be ways to access messages while still in temporary storage on recipients’ devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted. You should not use the Service to send messages if you want to be certain that the recipient cannot keep a copy. Although messages between you and other users of the App are not made publicly available on the App, we reserve the right to review such messages in the event we believe (in our sole discretion) that you violated our Terms of Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when you send or receive messages via our Service, we collect information about these messages, including the time, date, sender and recipient of the message. We also collect information about the number of messages sent and received between you and your friends and which friends you exchange messages with most frequently.</p>
<p><strong>Location Information:</strong>&nbsp;In addition to profile information, you may also tell us your exact location if you choose to enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Service, such as tagging Content with a location, and to improve and customize the Service, for example, with Content that has been tagged near your location.</p>
<p>When searching for golf courses on our site or on our mobile application, your location information may be sent to our servers in order to provide you with the golf courses nearest you. Your location information may also be used for analytics purposes to help us understand where people are using our application.</p>
<p>We collect certain information from your mobile device, including but not limited to the following: Location Information that allows us to periodically determine your location, which may include your location relative to and within third party merchant locations.</p>
<p>We may collect this information even if you are not logged in to the Application.</p>
<p>For iOS: You should be able to adjust the settings on your iOS mobile device to prevent our collection of Location Information by disabling the location services feature on your device*.</p>
<p>For Android: You should be able to adjust your settings on your Android mobile device to prevent our collection of Location Information be disabling Bluetooth and Location*.</p>
<p>* Please Note: with location services disabled your GPS will probably not work and the Application will be unable to provide distances.</p>
<p><strong>Links:</strong>&nbsp;We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Service, including our email notifications and third-party services. We do this to help improve our Service, for example to provide relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics, such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:</strong>&nbsp;We use various technologies to collect information and improve our Service, and this may include sending cookies to you. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory, and we may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Service and help us understand and customize how you interact with our Service, see which areas and features of our Service are popular and count visits. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged in to the Sites. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Sites. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Service.</p>
<p>We may also include web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”) on our Service, which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Service, to monitor how many visitors view our Service, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail). Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. If you do not want cookies from us or other websites, you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some features of the Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Log Information:</strong>&nbsp;Our servers automatically record information (“Log Data”) created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, pages visited and the time spent on those pages, search terms, and other statistics. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Service, for example, when you visit our Apps, sign into our Service, view Content hosted by us, or interact with our notifications. We use Log Data to provide, measure, customize, and improve the Services.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information:</strong>&nbsp;We may collect information about the computer or device you use to access our Service, including the hardware model, operating system and version, MAC address, unique device identifier, phone number, International Mobile Equipment Identity (“IMEI”), signal strength relating to WiFi or Bluetooth, and mobile carrier.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Parties:</strong>&nbsp;We use a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services and to help us understand the use of our Service, such as Google Analytics. These third-parties may collect information sent by the App or mobile device and share such information with us. These third parties may use tracking technologies, including, without limitation, cookies and web beacons to collect information about your use of the Service and other Apps, including your IP address, operating system, device ID, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain Content and better understand our users’ activity on the Service. Note that this Privacy Policy does not include use of cookies by such third parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We partner with third parties that collect information across various channels, including offline and online, for purposes of delivering more relevant advertising and content to you. Our partner may place or recognize a cookie on your computer or device and we may share personal information with them if you have submitted such information to us, such as your email address. Our partners may link the personal information we share with them to the cookie stored on your browser or device, and they may collect information such as your IP address, browser or operating system type and version, and demographic or inferred-interest information. Our partners use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. For example, our partners may deliver and/or enable downstream delivery of an ad to you in your web browser based on a purchase you made in a physical retail store, or they may send a personalized marketing email to you based on the fact that you visited a particular website.

<p>Swing by Swing is based in the United States and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law. By accessing or using the Service or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the storage, processing and transfer of information in and to the U.S. and other countries. You acknowledge that we may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. Please review the “Privacy Shield” section below for further information related to data transfers from the European Union (“EU”).</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We will not share your PII with third parties outside Swing by Swing without your consent, except as noted in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Parties With Whom We May Share Your Information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share your User Content and your PII with our affiliates. &nbsp;Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service and Affiliates’ own services (including, without limitation, by providing you with better and more relevant experiences).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may share your PII with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you (“Service Providers”). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may share certain anonymized information with third-party advertising partners. This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p>Any information and User Content that you voluntarily post to the Service is made publicly available and may be shared and re-shared by others. When you share information or User Content via the Service, you should think carefully about what you are making public. Please think of your own privacy needs as you choose what to upload, share, and make public on the Service. We cannot control the privacy or security of information and Content once you make it public or share it with others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any Content that you make public is searchable by other users and subject to use under our API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other users or third parties using our API have copied or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions:</strong>&nbsp;Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if Swing by Swing sells or otherwise transfers part or the whole of their respective business or their respective assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your PII, Content and any other information collected through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User Content.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Law and Harm:</strong>&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information, including your PII, if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information. We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. Finally, we may disclose your information to enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR CHOICES</strong></p>
<p>We offer you choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of your PII and we’ll respect the choices you make. Please note that if you decide not to provide us with the PII that we request, you may not be able to access all of the features of the Services.</p>
<p><strong>Opt-Out:</strong>&nbsp;We may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote Swing by Swing and its affiliates, the App, and/or our Service (including, without limitation, other apps powered by Swing by Swing). When you receive such promotional communications from us, you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive. We do need to send you certain communications regarding the Service and you will not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
