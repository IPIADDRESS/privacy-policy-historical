					<div id="privacy">
					<p>DailyCandy, Inc. takes very seriously the private nature of your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit our Web site and/or register for your sugar-fix. Please read this notice carefully.</p>
					<h2>Personal Information</h2>

					<p>In order to supply you with your DailyCandy e-mail, we need your e-mail address. Similarly, in order to supply you with text messaging services, we need your phone number and your provider information. So that we may provide you with additional services, we may also request your name, geographical coordinates, and telephone number. DailyCandy does not collect any other personal information that you do not expressly provide. DailyCandy will never sell, rent or share your personal information, including your e-mail address, with any third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission. DailyCandy may share your personal information for the purpose of delivering our e-mail to you or as required by law.</p>
					<h2>Non-Personal Information</h2>

					<p>We may also request non-personally identifiable information, such as [annual income, buying preferences, or age], also known as demographic and profile data, though this information is optional. We may use this data to improve our site and/or tailor your experience at our site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying content according to your preferences. We may also share this information with others, such as advertisers interested in advertising in the DailyCandy or our site, in aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any other person.</p>
					<h2>Usage Information</h2>

					<p>In addition to collecting personal and non-personal information, DailyCandy may also collect non-personal, aggregated information about subscribers' use of candy and our site. This information is not personally identifiable and will only be used to find out how subscribers use our service and site. For example, this information will tell us how much time users spend on our site, from which other sites subscribers came, and to what other sites subscribers go. The collection of this information allows us to, among other things, prepare for traffic load demands and to efficiently deliver your candy.</p>
					<h2>Review and Access</h2>

					<p>Upon your request, we will provide you with a summary of the information we collect about you. You will have an opportunity to correct, update or modify this information.</p>
					<h2>Choice/Opt-Out</h2>

					<p>If we ever send you information by e-mail concerning new products or services that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with an e-mail address by which you may request no future notices.
					</p><h2>Third Party Advertising</h2>

					<p>Some of the ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visit to their site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you. For more information about DoubleClick, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please visit	http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy.</p>
					
					<h2>Tracking</h2>

					<p>Like most sites (and true to its sugar-loving nature), DailyCandy makes use of browser "cookies." Cookies are small text files placed on your computer's hard disk by our server. They allow us to quickly check your status as a subscriber and facilitate access to your preferences. DailyCandy will never use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to our site or services.</p>

					<p>DailyCandy also uses transparent GIF images. We use these images to track the e-mails that we send out.</p>
					<h2>Third Party Cookies</h2>

					<p>In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.</p>
					<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

					<p>As part of the service, DailyCandy may create links allowing you to access third party sites. DailyCandy is not responsible for the content that appears on those sites and does not endorse these sites. Please consult those sites' individual privacy policies in order to determine how they treat user information.</p>
					<h2>Security</h2>

					<p>All information described above is stored on restricted database servers.</p>
					<p>Modification to this Policy</p>

					<p>DailyCandy may change this policy, but we'll post any changes here, so, when you're feeling low blood sugar, be sure to check in.</p>
					<h2>Contact Us</h2>

					<p>If you have any questions about this policy or our site in general, please contact us.</p>
