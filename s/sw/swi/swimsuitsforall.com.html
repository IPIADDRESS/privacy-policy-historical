                    <p>
                         The Safe Harbor program is an international data privacy program co-sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Swiss government. We voluntarily certified adherence to the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework for the customer data that we collect. Through this certification, we commit to uphold the Safe Harbor principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access, and Enforcement. You can learn more about those principles and our obligations under the Safe Harbor Certification Program by going to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor website at: <a href="http://2016.export.gov/safeharbor/swiss/" target="_blank">2016.export.gov/safeharbor/swiss/</a>. You can also view our Safe Harbor certification information through that site. If you have questions about our Safe Harbor privacy practices or believe that your information has been mismanaged, you can contact us by sending an e-mail to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:PrivacyOfficer@FBBrands.com">PrivacyOfficer@FBBrands.com</a>
                         <br>
                         <br>
                         In October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor.&nbsp; In February 2016, the U.S. and the European Commission agreed upon a new Privacy Shield framework, which framework must still be formally approved in the EU.&nbsp; We continue to commit to uphold the Safe Harbor principles, and are monitoring the development of the new Privacy Shield with the goal of continuing to participate in the framework once the Privacy Shield has been finalized.

Personal Information is information you provide that identifies you or that could be used to identify you. For example, if you register on our Site you will provide to us your name, address, and email address.
