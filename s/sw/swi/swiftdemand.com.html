<h1>Information</h1>

<p>While using our Site, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to your name, email, address, and identifying IDs ("Personal Information").

<p>Transactions you make with others will appear anonymously in the stats page, but will not be shown publicly on the site. We will attempt to keep specific transaction data private, but we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<br>
<h1>Security</h1>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
