<a name="thirdpartysites"></a><strong>Third Party Sites.</strong></p>
<p>If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the TOR site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as the TOR site. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to a TOR site, you should consult that site‚Äôs privacy policy before providing any personal information.</p>
<p><a name="whatispersonalinformationandwhendobiowareandlucasartscollectit"></a><strong>What is personal information and when do BioWare and LucasArts collect it?</strong></p>

<p>You may choose to disclose information, including personal information, about yourself in our online chat rooms, message boards, user "profiles" for public view or in similar forums on our sites. Information that you disclose in any of these forums is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality there.

<p>BioWare and LucasArts do not knowingly collect data from anyone under the age of 13.</p>
<p><a name="whataboutcookiesandothertechnologies"></a><strong>What about cookies and other technologies?</strong><br>
We use cookies and other technologies to passively collect demographic information, personalize your experience on our site and monitor advertisements and other activities. Cookies are small files downloaded to your computer to track movements within web sites. We may link cookie information to personal information. Cookies link to information regarding what items you have selected for purchase at our store, pages you have viewed, or games you have played.  We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game usage. We collect information on what games are played and how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked.  Some of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads may contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad companies, and Bioware and Lucas Arts do not have access to this information. Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do so. For more information concerning how to disable your cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.swtor.com/support">http://www.swtor.com/support</a>. Please note that this privacy policy covers the use of cookies by BioWare and LucasArts only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<p>Other technologies used include clear GIFs and IP address logging. Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an e-mail message. Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or e-mail message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information about you. However, we may use clear GIFs capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We may correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.</p>
<p>BioWare and LucasArts also maintain log files which contain Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we only use log files to monitor traffic on our Web sites, to report aggregate information to our advertisers and to troubleshoot technical problems. In the event of user abuse of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses or console IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers. IP addresses and console IDs may be used to personally identify you in order to enforce our Terms of Service.</p>
<p><a name="whathappenstotheinformationprovided"></a><strong>What happens to the information provided?</strong></p>
<p>BioWare and LucasArts do not disclose any personal information about children under 18 years of age who have registered on any of our websites to third parties, or share or disclose personal information other than as set forth in this policy, provided however, that in the event of a merger, acquisition, or the unlikely event of bankruptcy, management of BioWare and LucasArts customer information may be transferred to its successor or assign.</p>
<p>The personal information you provide will allow us to alert you to new products, features and enhancements; special offers; upgrade opportunities; and contests and events of interest. You may opt in to allow BioWare and Lucas Arts to share your personal information with companies and organizations that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.  For example, we may share your personal information with a sport licensor or sponsor of our service on our site.  You would be asked at that time if you wish to participate.  We see this as a value-added service helping you to find useful products or services. We strive to limit use of the information you provide to those offers that we think you would appreciate receiving.  To opt out of further communications from a marketing partner or sponsor with whom your information has been shared, please contact that partner directly. You may also later opt out of this service from BioWare and LucasArts.  See the "choice and opt-out" section below. We may send BioWare and LucasArts emails that may contain information regarding third-party products or services; however, this doesn‚Äôt mean that we‚Äôve traded your personal information to any party.</p>
<p>We may use survey information in marketing surveys to select and direct advertising that is more likely to be of interest to a particular member. This information may be transmitted to an ad server owned by the advertising company to match members with ads that they are more likely to be interested in. However, we do not disclose any member's personal information to our advertisers without the member's consent. Participation in member surveys is entirely optional. We may share aggregate consumer data (which does not contain personal information) with the advertising companies.</p>
<p>From time to time, BioWare and LucasArts may employ third-party contractors to collect personal information on our behalf to provide email delivery; product, prize or promotional fulfillment; contest administration; credit card processing; shipping or other services on our sites. When requesting these services, you may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address to our contractors.</p>
<p>We may use third party contractors, such as credit agencies or market research firms, to supplement personal information that you provide to us for our own marketing and demographic studies, so that we can consistently improve our sites and related advertising to better meet our visitors' needs and preferences. To enrich our profiles of individual customers, we tie this information to the personally identifiable information they have provided to us.</p>
<p>When our third-party contractors collect and/or have access to the personal information you provide to BioWare and LucasArts, BioWare requires that they adhere to our stated privacy policies and protect the confidentiality of personal information they collect or have access to in the course of their engagement by BioWare and LucasArts.  These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose without your specific consent.</p>
<p>You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.  If you do share your information, to opt-out from receiving further communications from any third party that is not our agent/service provider, please contact that marketing partner or affiliate directly.</p>
<p>To enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, we may also disclose personal information to law enforcement, or the appropriate civil authorities when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our site.</p>
