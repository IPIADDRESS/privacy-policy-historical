          <p>We don’t require personal information to access our  website.&nbsp; But if you prefer not to  disclose personal information, you may not be able to enjoy certain features of  our website.&nbsp; Personal  information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact  you.&nbsp; </p>
          <p><strong>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US </strong></p>
          <p>We will collect personal information from you when you use  certain features on our website. For example, we collect personal information </p>
          <ol>
            <li>register  for our website</li>
            <li>subscribe  to our newsletter</li>
            <li>participate  in polls, surveys, and questionnaires</li>
            <li>participate  in contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions</li>

            <li>receive  customer or technical support</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Typically, this information includes:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>name</li>
            <li>e-mail  address</li>
            <li>telephone  number</li>

            <li>for those  purchasing products online, credit card information.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Additionally, we may also collect other types of  information (known as demographic information) such as your age or date of  birth, gender, hobbies, occupation, platform preferences, and other game  ownership information.&nbsp; This demographic  information may be associated with your personal information.</p>
          <p><strong>If you are involved with our Merchant  Center or Affiliate Center,  we may request additional information to confirm the identity of you, your  banking institution, or your business.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH TECHNOLOGY </strong></p>
          <p>We collect information through technology to make our  websites more interesting and secure.&nbsp;  For example, when you come to one of our websites, we collect your IP  address.&nbsp; An IP address is often  associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP  (Internet Service Provider), your company, or your university.&nbsp; Standing alone, your IP address is not  personally identifiable.&nbsp; At times, we  also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which  our guests visit various parts of our websites.&nbsp;  We may combine this information with your personal information.</p>
          <p><strong>COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS </strong></p>
          <p>Our websites also use cookies and web beacons to collect  and store personal information. </p>
          <p>Cookies are pieces of information that a website sends to  your computer while you are viewing the website.&nbsp; We use cookies for a variety of  purposes.&nbsp; For example, when you return  to one of our websites after logging in, cookies provide information to the  website so that the website will remember who you are.&nbsp; You can choose to have your computer warn you  each time a cookie is sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies.&nbsp; You can do this through your browser (like  Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings.&nbsp; Each browser is a little different, so look  at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.&nbsp; If you turn cookies off, you won't have  access to many features that make your web experience smoother, like the  features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly.</p>
          <p>Web beacons are  small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites and  in our email communications.&nbsp; We also use  these web beacons to analyze the traffic patterns, such as the frequency users  visit various areas of our websites.&nbsp;  These technical methods may involve transmitting information either  directly to us or to another entity authorized by us to collect information on  our behalf.&nbsp; We also use web beacons in  HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have  opened those e-mails or clicked on links in those e-mails. </p>
          <p><strong>NETWORK ADVERTISERS </strong></p>
          <p>Advertisements that are managed by third parties may be placed  on our website.&nbsp; These companies are  called “network advertisers.”&nbsp; Network  advertisers who may place advertisements on our websites may also use cookies  and web beacons to collect non-personal information when you click on or move  your cursor over one of their banner advertisements. You may not realize this  information is being collected.&nbsp; In some  cases, we may have access to information from web beacons and cookies used by  network advertisers on our sites and this information may permit us to identify  other sites that you have visited that are also associated with the network  advertiser.</p>
          <p>Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement or third  party logo and have left our websites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and  you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal  information will be handled on their website.</p>

          <p>Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect  information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our  legitimate business objectives. </p>
          <p><strong>K2 ACTIVITES AND UPDATES </strong></p>
          <p>We use the personal information we collect to:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>respond to your requests for information and  newsletters,<strong></strong></li>
            <li>provide you with product support and customer  services,<strong></strong></li>
            <li>determine if you are eligible to receive certain  products or services,<strong></strong></li>
            <li>provide you with additional information that may be  of interest, including marketing materials, and</li>
            <li>for other everyday business purposes, such as  product development and website administration. </li>
          </ol>
          <p>We don’t share your personal information (e.g.,  e-mail address) with unaffiliated third parties to use for their direct  marketing purposes.</p>
          <p><strong>E-CARDS</strong></p>
          <p>When you send an e-card, we delete both sender and  recipient email address information after sending your e-card.</p>
          <p><strong>FORUMS AND MESSAGE BOARDS </strong></p>
          <p>If you register for access to our forums or message  boards, we may use your personal information to enable you to view and post  messages on the boards.&nbsp; You should  understand, however, that community forums, blogs, and message boards are tools  that allow you to communicate with members of the online community.&nbsp; So whenever you give out personal information  in public areas, that information can be collected and used by people you don’t  know.</p>
          <p><strong>SERVICE PROVIDERS </strong></p>
          <p>We occasionally employ  other companies to perform services necessary to our internal operations.&nbsp; For example, we may partner with other  companies to personalize our web pages, analyze customers’ interaction with our  website, and process consumer surveys.&nbsp;  We may also provide postal addresses to the U.S. Post Office or other  couriers for delivery purposes.&nbsp; While  providing services for us, these companies may access your personal  information.&nbsp; Those companies storing or  maintaining personal information for us have agreed to use secure methods. </p>
          <p><strong>BUSINESS INFORMATION </strong></p>
          <p>For practical reasons, we  treat personal information submitted to us in a business capacity different  from information we receive in a non-business capacity.&nbsp; Personal information submitted to us in a  business capacity (e.g. resumes, event sponsorship, etc.) may be shared with  third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry. </p>
          <p><strong>PURCHASE OR SALE OF BUSINESS </strong></p>
          <p>From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one  or more of our businesses and your personal information may be transferred as a  part of the purchase or sale.&nbsp; If we  purchase a business, the personal information received with that business would  be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and  permissible to do so.&nbsp; If we sell a  business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the  purchaser to treat your personal information in the same way required by this  Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy).&nbsp; The provisions of this paragraph will also  apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
          <p><strong>DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY LAW AND DISCLOSURES TO HELP PROTECT THE SECURITY AND SAFETY OF OUR WEBSITES AND OTHERS </strong></p>
          <p>Please note that we may disclose any information as permitted or  required by law, when we believe in good faith it is necessary for safety  purposes, required for legal reporting, or to protect our legal rights or  enforce our Terms of Use or any contest rules.&nbsp;  We may also disclose information about you to our auditors or legal  advisors, or in response to a subpoena.&nbsp; </p>
          <p><strong>AGGREGATE INFORMATION </strong></p>
          <p>We may take your personal information and make it  non-personally identifiable.&nbsp; We do this  either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating  your information with information about other individuals), and by removing  characteristics (e.g., your name) that make the information personally  identifiable to you.&nbsp; This process is  known as de-personalizing your information.&nbsp;  We may use de-personalized information in any way and share it with  third parties.&nbsp; <u></u></p>

          <p>K2 Network has developed its  websites with the goal of creating an enjoyable experience for all users.&nbsp;  This Kids Privacy Policy is designed to answer your  questions regarding our privacy policies concerning children under the age of  13. </p>
          <p><br>
            Building on our general  Privacy Policy, we recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections  when children visit sites on which we post this Kids Privacy Policy.&nbsp; We  explain those additional protections in this Kids Privacy Policy. </p>
          <p><br>
            The Children's Online  Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that we inform parents and legal  guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from  kids under 13 years of age.&nbsp; COPPA also requires us to obtain the consent  of parents and guardians for children under 13 years of age to use certain  features of our Web sites.&nbsp; Below we explain how we do that for  kids.&nbsp; Also, when we use the term “parent” below, we mean to include legal  guardians. </p>
          <p><br>
            This certification seal shown on  this page confirms that K2 Network is a member in good standing of <a href="http://www.esrb.org/privacy/index.jsp">ESRB’s Privacy Online Program</a>.&nbsp;  ESRB’s Privacy Online Program is designed to ensure that our website’s  information disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate.&nbsp; To  protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative  and all of our websites have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online  to meet established online information collection and use practices.&nbsp; As  part of this privacy program, ESRB independently audits our websites, and  administers other enforcement and accountability mechanisms.</p>

          <p>Kids can surf K2  Network’s sites, view content, and enjoy many features without having to  disclose any personal information.&nbsp; We don’t collect personal information  from kids while they use our sites unless they register on K2 Network’s sites’ Official Forums. </p>

            For those who choose to register  and participate in certain areas of our website, we collect personal  information directly from kids to: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>register for our Official Forum</li>
            <li>participate in polls, surveys, and  questionnaires on the Official Forum</li>
          </ol>
          <p>We may collect personal  information from parents to allow kids to participate in certain activities  offered on our websites and within our kids' subscription products.&nbsp; These  activities may include purchasing product in one of our online stores,  participating in games, reward programs, contests, sweepstakes, events or other  promotions. <br>
            Typically, this information  includes:</p>
          <ol start="1" type="1">
            <li>name </li>
            <li>email address </li>

            <li>for those purchasing products online, credit card       information. </li>
          </ol>
          <p>We may collect  demographic information (e.g., date of birth, gender, and game preferences) and  combine it with the child’s personal information.&nbsp; K2 Network will only  collect this information if it is voluntarily and properly submitted to us by  either the child or parent. </p>
          <p><br>
            Note that all  commercial sites directed to children under 13 are prohibited by U.S. law from  conditioning a kid’s participation in an online activity on the kid's providing  more personal information than is reasonably necessary. </p>
          <p><br>
            Some areas of our  website may offer features like electronic postcards that allow kids to submit  personal information (e.g., email address) without first disclosing their age  or obtaining verifiable parental consent.&nbsp; These areas provide services in  a way that doesn’t require prior verifiable parental consent. </p>
          <p><br>
            Finally, we may collect  demographic information about kids.&nbsp; For example, if a kid participates in  a survey, we may collect those responses.&nbsp; Among them, we may collect age,  gender, hobbies, and interests or other demographic information about gaming  and preferences.&nbsp; We also use some passive technologies, including cookies  and web beacons, to monitor traffic on our websites.&nbsp; This demographic  information may be associated with a child’s personal information. </p>
