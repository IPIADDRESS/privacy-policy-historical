				Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a

				provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to 
				customize our service to make your experience safer and easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
				only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for 
				achieving this purpose.<br>
				<br>
				In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing 
				any personal information about yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you give us your 
				personal information, you are not anonymous to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you choose to 
				use our services, we may require you to provide contact and identity 
				information, billing information, shipping information and other personal 
				information as indicated on the forms throughout the Site.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where 
				possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are 
				optional.&nbsp;&nbsp;You always have the option to not provide information by 
				choosing not to use a particular service or feature.<br>
				<br>
				Under some circumstances we may require some additional financial information, 
				such as, but not limited to: if you are registering using an email account at a 
				free email service, or registering to sell on the Site.&nbsp;&nbsp;We use your 
				financial information, including credit card or PayPal account information to verify the accuracy

				<br>
				<br>
				We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the

				If you choose to trade on the Site, we collect information about your trading

				If you establish a credit account with us to pay for certain services or to

				If you choose to post messages in our, chat rooms, item reviews, groups or

				If you register for Swap.com on another web site or use a web site providing a

				<div class="swapsubHead swapLineTextPad"><a name="6">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;our disclosure of 
						your information </a>
				</div>
				<div class="headlineLine"></div>
				As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any of your personal information 
				to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit 
				consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the following describes some of the ways that your 
				personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to 
				provide our services.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Advertisers</b><br>
				We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal information and 
				disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to 
				advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional 
				purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these 
				entities any information that could be used to identify you 
				personally.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain information, such as your name, email address, 
				password, credit card number, PayPal account and bank account number, are not disclosed to 
				these third parties in a personally identifiable manner without your explicit 
				consent.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Swap.com Community</b><br>
				Your User ID is displayed throughout the Site and is therefore available to the 
				public.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of your activities on the Site will be identifiable to 
				your User ID.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other people can see the items you are offering to 
				trade and items that you want, items that you have purchased in the past, your 
				feedback rating and associated comments, your postings on the Site, and so 
				on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if you associate your name with your User ID, the 
				people you have revealed your name to will be able to personally identify your 
				Swap.com activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our pages are coded with robot 
				exclusion headers, others may illegally attempt to automatically collect your 
				email address from the Site.&nbsp;&nbsp;We describe how to change your email 
				and User ID below in Section 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are involved in a 
				transaction, we have features that allow other users to view your email address 
				and obtain your contact and shipping information to help complete the 
				transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, we may send out notices to you or other 
				community members regarding suspicious activity or policy violations on the 
				Site.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Internal Service Providers for Our Operations</b><br>
				We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to 
				facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and 
				service operations that we provide to you (e.g., search technology, discussion 
				boards, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs, co-branded credit 
				cards) and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly 
				to these internal service providers.&nbsp;&nbsp;These internal service 
				providers' are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal 
				restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any 
				other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced Swap.com related 
				operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to 
				them for additional uses.&nbsp;&nbsp;In some instances, the internal service 
				provider may collect information directly from you.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these cases, 
				you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and 
				all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be 
				strictly up to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you provide additional information to an 
				internal service provider directly, then their use of your personal information 
				is governed by their applicable privacy policy.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Legal Requests</b><br>
				Swap.com cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third 
				parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other 
				rights, to help protect you and the Swap.com community from bad 
				actors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in response to a verified request by law 
				enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation 
				or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your 
				name, city, state, telephone number, email address, User ID history, fraud 
				complaints, and bidding and listing history without a 
				subpoena.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your 
				privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not 
				otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other 
				government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar 
				legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of 
				information is necessary to: prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; 
				or report suspected illegal activity.
				<br>
				<br>
				Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your 
				private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed 
				in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of 
				example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal 
				information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, 
				third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private 
				communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that 
				they collect from the Site.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, although we use industry 
				standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should 
				not expect, that your personal information or private communications will 
				always remain private.<br>

				by going to the necessary section in account info tab of your profile page.&nbsp;&nbsp;You must promptly 
				update your personal information if it changes or is 
				inaccurate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once posted, you may not be able to change or remove any 
				public postings made on the Site including our chat rooms or other message 
				areas or the feedback area.<br>

				Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact information,
