We will process any requests in accordance with applicable law and within a reasonable period of time. We may need to verify the identity of the individual submitting a request before we can address such request. If the request relates to data our customers collect and process through the SmartBear Services, we will refer the request to that customer and will support them in responding to the request. &nbsp;For SmartBear customers, certain information may be reviewed, corrected and updated by logging into the SmartBear Services account and editing the profile information.</p>

<p><strong>Questions and Complaints</strong>. In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, SmartBear commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your Personal Data. Residents of a country participating in the Privacy Shield Framework may direct any questions or complaints concerning our Privacy Shield compliance to our Privacy Shield and Data Protection Contact. We will work with you to resolve your issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If we have not responded to a concern relating to data processed under the Privacy Shield Framework in a timely manner, or we have not addressed the concern satisfactorily, you may contact our U.S.-based dispute resolution provider, at no cost, at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim">https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim</a>. If neither SmartBear nor our independent dispute resolution provider resolve your complaint, you may have the possibility to invoke binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel. However, prior to initiating such arbitration, a resident of a country participating in the Privacy Shield Framework must first: (1) contact us and afford us the opportunity to resolve the issue; (2) seek assistance from our designated independent dispute resolution provider; and (3) contact the U.S. Department of Commerce (either directly or through a European DPA) and afford the Department of Commerce time to attempt to resolve the issue. If such a resident invokes binding arbitration, each party shall be responsible for its own attorney’s fees. Pursuant to the Privacy Shield, the arbitrator(s) may only impose individual-specific, non-monetary, equitable relief necessary to remedy any violation of the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the resident.</p>

<p><strong>U.S. Federal Trade Commission Enforcement</strong>. SmartBear’s commitments under the Privacy Shield are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission.</p>

<p><strong>Compelled Disclosures</strong>. SmartBear may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy Shield and Data Protection Contact</strong>. Unless otherwise specified, the data controller of personal data uploaded to the SmartBear Services is the SmartBear customer for whom such Services are provided and SmartBear is the processor of such data for such customer. In certain cases, SmartBear may also be the controller of aggregated, anonymous or pseudonymous data relating to the SmartBear Services.
