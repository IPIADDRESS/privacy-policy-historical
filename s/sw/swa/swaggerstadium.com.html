        SwaggerStadium is a skills-based gaming company that is owned and operated in the USA.
        Our daily fantasy sports contests are much shorter than traditional season-long leagues and last for only one night.
        We offer daily leagues for
            <!--<a href="events/NFL">Fantasy Football</a>,-->
            <!--<a href="events/CFB">College Fantasy Football</a>,-->
            <a href="lobby/NASCAR">Fantasy NASCAR</a>,
            <a href="lobby/NHL">Fantasy Hockey</a>,
            <a href="lobby/CBB">College Fantasy Basketball</a>,
            <a href="lobby/MMA">Fantasy UFC</a>,
            and
            <a href="lobby/NBA">Fantasy Basketball</a>; plus, we have more sports on the way!
        Our event-based leagues are super-easy to complete.
        In most cases, it takes just a few seconds to create a lineup.
        We offer new contests every day of the season, and our winners are crowned at the end of the day.
        Payouts occur immediately after the last game of the night.
        <!--Each league only has two games so you won't need to wait until the end of the night to collect.-->
    </p>
    
    <p style="font-size:smaller;">
        "Combine Sports" and "Live Subs" are patent pending features.
