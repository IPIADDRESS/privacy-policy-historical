              staff at Swapalease Inc. can keep users posted of new listings and

              In order to list a leased vehicle on this website, a user must first 
              complete the required listing sections. During registration a user 
              is required to provide sensitive information (such as social security 
              number and credit card number including expiration date), in addition 
              to contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic 
              information (such as zip code). This information is principally 
              used for verification of lease account information from a particular 
              leasing company and the collection of any listing fee due Swapalease 
              Inc.. Secondarily, this data is used for contacting the user as

              When they return, they must reenter their password to regain access 
              to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date 
              on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as 
              any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or 
              reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they 
              can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, 
              the servers that we store personally identifiable information on 
              are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.</font></p>
