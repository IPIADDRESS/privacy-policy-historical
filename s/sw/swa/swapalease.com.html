              It is not necessary for a user to register in order to browse the 
              Swapalease Inc. Web Site; however, it is recommended so that the 
              staff at Swapalease Inc. can keep users posted of new listings and 
              special events. It will also allow personalization of the web site 
              when the user returns in the future.</p>

              "Seller's" Perspective:</font></i><br>
              In order to list a leased vehicle on this website, a user must first 
              complete the required listing sections. During registration a user 
              is required to provide sensitive information (such as social security 
              number and credit card number including expiration date), in addition 
              to contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic 
              information (such as zip code). This information is principally 
              used for verification of lease account information from a particular 
              leasing company and the collection of any listing fee due Swapalease 
              Inc.. Secondarily, this data is used for contacting the user as 
              well as making the sight more personalized for a particular user.</p>

              "Buyer's" Perspective:</font></i><br>
              We request information from the user on our credit statement form. 
              Here a user must provide sensitive information (such as social security 
              number and credit card number including expiration date), in addition 
              to contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic 
              information (such as income and age level). This information is primarily 
              used for credit assessment purposes and collection of processing fees specifically 
              pertaining to the lease transfer process. Creditors receiving this information will 
              retain the user's application whether or not it is approved and will handle this 
              information in accordance with their privacy policy. Secondarily, this data is used for 
              contacting the user as well as making the site more personalized for a

              of your perspective when using the Swapalease Inc. web site you

              </b>This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. 
              When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information 
              is protected both online and off-line.</p>
            <p>When our registration 
              form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card 
              number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted 
              and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry 
              - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock 
              icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and 
              Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, 
              or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow 
              this link <a href="http://www.verisign.com">www.verisign.com</a>.</p>
            <p>While we use 
              SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also 
              do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. 
              All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information 
              mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who 
              need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our 
              billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted 
              access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must 
              use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. 
              When they return, they must reenter their password to regain access 
              to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date 
              on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as 
              any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or 
              reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they 
              can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, 
              the servers that we store personally identifiable information on 
              are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.</p>
            <p>If you have 
              any questions about the security at our website, you can send an 
              email to <a href="mailto:security@swapalease.com">security@swapalease.com</a>.
