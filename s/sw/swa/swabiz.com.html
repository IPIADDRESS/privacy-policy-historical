<h1>southwest.com Privacy Policy </h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Southwest Airlines website, <a href="http://www.southwest.com/">www.southwest.com</a> as well as Southwest Airlines’ website specifically designed for business travelers, <a href="http://www.swabiz.com/">www.swabiz.com</a>.</p>
<p>Southwest Airlines cares about your privacy. When you visit the Southwest Airlines website, the information you provide to us will be handled according to the standards outlined below.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Information Collection &amp; Use</h3>
<p><strong><u>Purchases</u></strong></p>
<p>If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you during the purchase process. You must provide contact information (such as name, phone number, and address) and billing information (such as credit card number and expiration date) in order to complete a purchase.</p>
<p>We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.</p>
<p><b style="display:block;">Privacy Policy</b>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires you to provide your full name, date of birth, and gender for the purpose of watch list screening, under the authority of 49 U.S.C. section 114, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and 49 C.F.R parts 1540 and 1560. You may also provide your Redress Number, if available. Failure to provide your full name, date of birth, and gender may result in denial of transport or denial of authority to enter the boarding area. TSA may share information you provide with law enforcement or intelligence agencies or others under its published system of records notice. For more on TSA privacy policies, or to review the system of records notice and the privacy impact assessment, please see the TSA Web site at www.tsa.gov.</p>
<p><strong><u>Contests and Surveys</u></strong></p>
<p>We may occasionally offer users the opportunity to participate in surveys or contests on our website.</p>
<p>If we have your e-mail address, we may also send you surveys or contest invitations by e-mail. We may have your e-mail address if:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>you have made a purchase on our website and provided your e-mail address during the purchase process;</li>
<li>you have set up a Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> account, MySouthwest<sup>®</sup> account, SWAbiz<sup>®</sup> Traveler account, Travel Guide account, or other Southwest Airlines account and provided your e-mail address either during the registration process or when updating your account information;</li>
<li>you provide a friend’s e-mail address when you refer the friend to one of our web pages;</li>
<li>we have received your e-mail address by any other means.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to participate in a contest or survey, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. This information may include contact information (such as name, e-mail, phone number and shipping address) and optional demographic information (such as your age and gender).</p>
<p>Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. We use this information to administer the contest or survey (e.g., notify contest winners, award prizes and update participants’ profiles). We may also use this information to improve the website experience for our Customers or to improve our product or service offerings.</p>
<p>We may use third party service providers to conduct these surveys or contests. These companies are prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. These third parties are bound by contract to Southwest Airlines to use adequate security measures to protect your personal information.</p>
<p><strong><u>DING!</u></strong></p>
<p>From our website, you have the option to download our DING! application. If you choose to download this application, you will be notified of exclusive Southwest airfare offers.</p>
<p>You do not have to install DING! to use our website, and downloading the application is completely voluntary. If you choose to take advantage of this application, you will be asked to provide up to 10 airports for which you are interested in receiving special offers. You will also be asked to provide your Rapid Rewards number, although providing this information is not required to use the application.</p>
<p>For more information on our DING! application, please visit <a href="/ding/what_is_ding.html">http://www.southwest.com/ding/what_is_ding.html</a>.</p>
<p><strong><u>Forward-to-a-Friend and Refer-a-Friend</u></strong></p>
<p>You may use a referral feature (either on a webpage, in an e-mail, from a banner ad or other communication) to inform a friend about a Southwest webpage or promotion. Southwest may use any e-mail address provided when using this referral feature to send both an initial e-mail and a subsequent e-mail to recipients about the particular promotion, product or service in which you indicated your “friend” may have an interest.</p>
<p><u><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect</strong></u></p>
<p>In some cases, Southwest may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include, but are not limited to the frequency of your use of this website and the route by which you choose to access it, and your use of any hyperlinks available on this website. We and our service providers or agents may process and use this data for purposes including, but not limited to planning website development, assessing patterns of use, planning and assessing marketing initiatives by Southwest. This information is gathered by certain tools and methods such as the collection of your IP address or the use of cookies.</p>
<p><strong><em>IP Addresses</em></strong></p>
<p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our websites. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information except for fraud prevention.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cookies</em></strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on all Southwest affiliated websites covered by this Privacy Policy. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our websites.</p>
<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our websites. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.</p>
<p>We set a persistent cookie to store your account number, so you don’t have to enter it each time you want to log-in to your Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup>, MySouthwest<sup>®</sup> or SWABiz<sup>®</sup> account. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site.</p>
<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited and we will not be able to provide you with the most convenient experience.</p>
<p><strong><u>Site Usage Profile</u></strong></p>
<p>We store information that we collect through cookies and log files to create a “profile” of your preferences. We may use this information to provide you with targeted advertisements and offers on our website.</p>
<p>We may also share this information in the aggregate (without any personally identifiable information linked to it in combination with other users’ information) with our marketing partners.</p>
<p><strong><u>MySouthwest<sup>®</sup>, SWABiz,<sup>®</sup> Travel Guide, and Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> Registration</u></strong></p>
<p>You are not required to establish a MySouthwest<sup>®</sup> account (also referred to as a SWABiz<sup>®</sup> Traveler account for the users of our SWABiz<sup>®</sup> website designed for corporate use) to use this website, however some features of our site are not available to unregistered users. For example, you must have a Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup>, MySouthwest<sup>®</sup> or SWABiz<sup>®</sup> account to save your travel preferences (such as the type of rental car your prefer or your favorite travel routes) for future travel arrangements made through our website, store credit card information so that you do not need to reenter it for future purchases, have access to special Members-only promotions and discounts, or provide ratings, reviews or comments in our Travel Guide section of the website.</p>
<p>If you would like to take advantage of the conveniences available through special MySouthwest<sup>®</sup> or SWABiz<sup>®</sup> features, you must first register for a MySouthwest<sup>®</sup> or SWABiz<sup>®</sup> account. Additional features are available to Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> Members. To take advantage of those additional features, you must first enroll in the Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> program. During registration, you are required to provide contact information (such as name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and company name). Your birth date may be used to determine your eligibility to receive special age-restricted offers, such as coupons for alcoholic beverages on Southwest Airlines flights or other marketing offers. It is also necessary for you to provide your date of birth so that we can confirm your identity if you ask us to reset the password on your account.</p>
<p>Additionally, you have the option to provide demographic information (such as whether you are a college student age 18 to 23) and travel preferences to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site and send you valuable travel offers. We may use the travel preferences you store in your profile to send you special targeted e-mails based on these preferences. For example, if you express a preference for a specific type of rental car, we may send you special offers for renting this type of vehicle.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> Program</em></strong></p>
<p>If you do not already have a Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> account, you can easily establish one during the MySouthwest<sup>®</sup> or SWABiz<sup>®</sup> registration process. Electing to establish a Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> account will enroll you in the Southwest Airlines frequent flyer program and give you the opportunity to earn free award travel by flying with Southwest Airlines and/or doing business with our Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> Preferred Partners. You will not be able to earn credits toward free flights if you elect to not sign up for this program. As a Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> Member, you may also receive special offers by e-mail simply for being a Member of the Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> program.</p>
<p>We may use the personally identifiable information you provide when you become a Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> Member for analytical, administrative, marketing, correspondence or other operational purposes. For more information on how we may use your personally identifiable information as a Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> Member, please see our <strong>Customer Communications</strong> section below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Social Security Numbers</em></strong></p>
<p>We do not require your social security number to enroll in the Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> Program, create a MySouthwest<sup>®</sup> or SWABiz<sup>®</sup> account or when you make a purchase. You do, however, have the option to provide the last four digits of your social security number when you establish a Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> account. This information will help us confirm your identity on <b>southwest.com</b>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Customer Communications</h3>
<p><u><b>Post Purchase E-mail Communication</b></u></p>
<p>When you make a travel reservation with us and you provide your e-mail address during the purchase process, we will send you a confirmation e-mail that includes the details of your purchase.</p>
<p>If you provide your e-mail during the purchase process, we may also use your e-mail address to contact you about service-related information in connection with your reservation or to inform you of upgrades or product enhancements related to your purchase. We may also request your feedback on our services and/or your specific travel experience.</p>
<p>Shortly before your trip, we may send you a pre-trip e-mail confirming the details of the travel-related services you purchased through our website. This e-mail will also include special offers for products or services from Southwest Airlines or our marketing partners related to your trip.</p>
<p><u><b>E-Mail Promotions, Offers and Updates</b></u></p>
<p>As a Member of the Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> program, you may opt to receive Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> e-mail communications which may include program news and special offers either during the Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> enrollment process or from you Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> account preferences webpage. The default option is not to receive these e-mail communications, so you need to let us know if you are interested in receiving these messages with special Members-only news and offers. You may also opt-out of receiving these messages at any time by adjusting your preferences through the account preferences webpage.</p>
<p>We also provide you with the option of subscribing to our Click ‘n Save and In A Nutshell e-mail updates without establishing a Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> or MySouthwest<sup>®</sup> account.
