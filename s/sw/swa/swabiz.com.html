<p><strong>Rapid Rewards Program</strong></p>
<p>If you do not already have a Rapid Rewards account, you can easily establish one during the MySouthwest or SWABIZ registration process.&nbsp; Electing to establish a Rapid Rewards account will enroll you in the Southwest Airline frequent flyer program and give you the opportunity to earn free award travel by flying with Southwest Airlines and/or doing business with our Rapid Rewards Preferred Partners.&nbsp; You will not be able to earn points toward free flights if you elect to not sign up for this program.&nbsp; As a Rapid Rewards Member, you may also receive special offers by e-mail simply for being a Member of the Rapid Rewards program.</p>
