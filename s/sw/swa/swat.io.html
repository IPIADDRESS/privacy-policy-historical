        </ul> <h2>E.&nbsp; Personal data access and control.</h2> <p><em>&nbsp;</em>The
          organization recognizes data subjects rights to access information and to be
          forgotten, therefore has implemented controls in order to show its
          transparency in terms of the information processing to the data subject.</p>
        <p>Data subjects who want to execute their rights to access information or
          deletion can contact our team at <a href="mailto:privacy@swat.io">privacy@swat.io</a>
          Every request that is received is delivered to the responsible person for
          handling data subject requests, the requests are being reviewed and it is
          acted accordingly. If there are no present acts that impose the need for the
          information to be kept, the information is properly removed from the system.
          In case when some or all of the information that is kept and is being
          requested to be removed, the data processor (the organization) is required to
          keep and has clearly defined retention period for this information, the
          organization keeps all information that is required and all other not relevant
          information is being removed. In both cases the data subject that requests the
          removal is being contacted with the outcome of the procedure. The same
          procedures take places when the data subject requests data modification.</p>
        <p>All of the requests with their outcomes are being documented.</p> <h2>F.&nbsp;
