									about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose<br>
									<br>
									In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing

									personal information, you are not anonymous to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you choose to

									We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the

								<!-- QUESTION -->
								<div class="headerSpacer01"><a name="6"><span class="swapsubHead">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;our 
											disclosure of your information</span> </a>
								</div>
								<div class="swapLineTest"></div>
								<div class="contentSpacer2">As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any of 
									your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without 
									your explicit consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the following describes some of the 
									ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of 
									business to provide our services.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Advertisers</b><br>
									We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal information and 
									disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to 
									advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional 
									purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these 
									entities any information that could be used to identify you 
									personally.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain information, such as your name, email address, 
									password, credit card number, and bank account number, are not disclosed to 
									these third parties in a personally identifiable manner without your explicit 
									consent.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Swaptree Community</b><br>
									Your User ID is displayed throughout the Site and is therefore available to the 
									public.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of your activities on the Site will be identifiable to 
									your User ID.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other people can see the items you are offering to 
									trade and items that you want, items that you have purchased in the past, your 
									feedback rating and associated comments, your postings on the Site, and so 
									on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if you associate your name with your User ID, the 
									people you have revealed your name to will be able to personally identify your 
									swaptree activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our pages are coded with robot 
									exclusion headers, others may illegally attempt to automatically collect your 
									email address from the Site.&nbsp;&nbsp;We describe how to change your email 
									and User ID below in Section 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are involved in a 
									transaction, we have features that may allow other users to view your email address 
									and obtain your contact and shipping information to help complete the 
									transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, we may send out notices to you or other 
									community members regarding suspicious activity or policy violations on the 
									Site.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Internal Service Providers for Our Operations</b><br>
									We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to 
									facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and 
									service operations that we provide to you (e.g., search technology, discussion 
									boards, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs, co-branded credit 
									cards) and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly 
									to these internal service providers.&nbsp;&nbsp;These internal service 
									providers' are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal 
									restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any 
									other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced swaptree related 
									operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to 
									them for additional uses.&nbsp;&nbsp;In some instances, the internal service 
									provider may collect information directly from you.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these cases, 
									you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and 
									all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be 
									strictly up to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you provide additional information to an 
									internal service provider directly, then their use of your personal information 
									is governed by their applicable privacy policy.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Legal Requests</b><br>
									Swaptree cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third 
									parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other 
									rights, to help protect you and the swaptree community from bad 
									actors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in response to a verified request by law 
									enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation 
									or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your 
									name, city, state, telephone number, email address, UserID history, fraud 
									complaints, and bidding and listing history without a 
									subpoena.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your 
									privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not 
									otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other 
									government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar 
									legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of 
									information is necessary to: prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; 
									or report suspected illegal activity.
									<br>
									<br>
									Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your 
									private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed 
									in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of 
									example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal 
									information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, 
									third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private 
									communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that 
									they collect from the Site.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, although we use industry 
									standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should 
									not expect, that your personal information or private communications will 
									always remain private<br>
