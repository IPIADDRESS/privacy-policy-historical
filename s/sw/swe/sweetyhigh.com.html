Finally, these licensees and co-branding participants' use of your personal information that we share with them is subject to your ability to opt-out of the use of your personal information to send promotional materials to you.</p><p data-reactid="187">Finally, we may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable information, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this information, nothing in this Privacy Policy restricts or limits our ability to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information or any use and/or sharing with third parties of the resulting non-personally identifiable information.</p><h4 data-reactid="188">Third Parties </h4><p data-reactid="189">When we share your personal information with a third party under any of the circumstances described in this section, your personal information will become subject to the third party's information use and sharing practices and this Privacy Policy will not apply to its use and further sharing of your personal information.</p><p data-reactid="190">We may share your personal information when you engage in certain activities on the Sweety High Site that are sponsored by third parties, such as electing to receive information or communications from a third party, or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored in whole or in part by a third party. We refer to all of these activities and requests as "Sponsored Activities." When you participate in Sponsored Activities, you will either be required or requested to agree that the sponsor or business associate may use your personal information (including, in some cases, your e-mail address) in accordance with the sponsor or business associate's privacy practices. By agreeing to share your personal information, you will not have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving promotional materials from "Third Parties" as provided below.</p><h4 data-reactid="191">Companies That Facilitate Communications and Transactions with You</h4><p data-reactid="192">On occasion, we may engage companies to help provide products or services, like a shipping company or a company that fulfills prizes for a sweepstakes. In those instances, we need to share your personal information with these companies. We may work with other companies who help either gather your information or communicate with you, such as a company that helps to provide customer service. You will not have the opportunity to opt-out of allowing us to share your personal information with any of these companies. Nonetheless, except as otherwise permitted in this Privacy Policy, these companies are allowed to gather, receive, and use your information only for the purposes described in this paragraph or to facilitate compliance with laws.</p><h4 data-reactid="193">Companies That You Previously Authorized to Obtain Your Personal Information</h4><p data-reactid="194">In certain circumstances, you may have authorized a third party to obtain your personal information from us and to use that information in accordance with the third party's own privacy practices and policies. In such circumstances, your election to opt-out of allowing us to share your personal information will not apply to our sharing your personal information with this third party. Under these circumstances, we will provide these third parties only the information that you authorized (except as otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy).</p><h4 data-reactid="195">Disclosures to Comply With Laws and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of the Sweety High Site, the Company and Others</h4><p data-reactid="196">Regardless of any opt-out elections that you make, we will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) facilitate compliance with laws, including, for example, compliance with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce the Terms of Service; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and security of the Sweety High Site, and/or third parties, including the safety and security of property that belongs to us or third parties.</p><h4 data-reactid="197">Purchase or Sale of Businesses</h4><p data-reactid="198">In addition, if the Company becomes involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of the Company's assets, user information, including personal information collected from you through your use of the Sweety High Site, could be included in the transferred assets. Visitors to the Sweety High Site will be notified via a notice on the Sweety High Site for thirty (30) days prior to a change of ownership or control of user information held by the Company.</p><h4 data-reactid="199">What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information?</h4><p data-reactid="200">With regard to personal information that you have provided to us, you have the ability to opt-out of giving us your consent to use your personal information by contacting us via e-mail at contact@sweetyhigh.com. This opt-out is subject to the exceptions described further below.</p><h4 data-reactid="201">Your opt-out choices are:</h4><p data-reactid="202">Third Parties : You may choose to opt-out of receiving promotional materials from third parties. If you do not choose to opt-out, we may share your personal information with third parties in order to send you these promotional materials. If you elect to opt-out, your election will apply only to the particular websites where you make these elections. Thus, if you want to opt-out of all uses of your personal information described in this section, you must make your election to opt-out when you register or when you log in and visit that website's Guest Services center.</p><p data-reactid="203">Please keep in mind that any opt-out elections you make will not apply in situations where (a) you either have made, simultaneously make, or later make a specific request for information from the Sweety High Site, (b) "Operational Uses" or "Fulfillment Uses," (c) you either have engaged, simultaneously engage, or later engage in Sponsored Activities, or (d) sharing your personal information as described in the following sections of this Privacy Policy: "Companies That Facilitate Communications and Transactions With You," "Companies That You Previously Authorized to Obtain Your Personal Information," "Purchase or Sale of Businesses," or "Disclosures to Comply with Laws and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of the Sweety High Site, the Company and Others." Also, any opt-out choices you make will not apply to personal information that you provide about other persons, but these other persons will have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving promotional materials.</p><p data-reactid="204">In addition, promotional materials that we send you may be accompanied by other promotional materials that are covered by other opt-out elections you have made. We may do so even if you have opted out of receiving promotional materials covered by those other opt-out elections. For example, we may send you promotional materials accompanied by a third party's promotional materials , even if you have previously opted out of receiving promotional materials from that third party. Any such additional promotional materials, however, will constitute only a minor part of any particular communication with you.</p><p data-reactid="205">Finally, if you do not elect to opt-out, it may take up to ninety (90) days to implement your opt-out election. Our systems require time to update, and promotional mailings using your personal information shared before you opt-out may already be in process. Finally, please keep in mind that, if you have not consistently used the same postal and e-mail addresses for communications through the Sweety High Site, or if you have used a general change of address process (such as the change of address process offered by the U.S. Post Office) after providing address information through the Sweety High Site, we may not have your correct contact information. Accordingly, we may not be able to honor your opt-out election if we are unable to match your new opt-out elections with your personal information that you previously have provided.</p><h4 data-reactid="206">What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?</h4><p data-reactid="207">We take the security and confidentiality of your personal information very seriously. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures aimed at protecting personal information from unauthorized access and improper use. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though that, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.</p><h4 data-reactid="208">How can you ask questions, or send us comments, about this Privacy Policy?</h4><p data-reactid="209">If you have questions or wish to send us comments about this Privacy Policy, please send an e-mail with your questions or comments to contact@sweetyhigh.com or write us at:</p><blockquote data-reactid="210"><!-- react-text: 211 -->Sweety High<!-- /react-text --><br data-reactid="212"><!-- react-text: 213 -->c/o Stubbs Alderton &amp; Markiles, LLP<!-- /react-text --><br data-reactid="214"><!-- react-text: 215 -->15260 Ventura Blvd., 20th Floor<!-- /react-text --><br data-reactid="216"><!-- react-text: 217 -->Sherman Oaks, CA 91403<!-- /react-text --></blockquote><p data-reactid="218">Please be assured that any personal information that you provide in communications to the above e-mail and postal mail addresses will not be used to send you promotional materials, unless you so request.</p><h4 data-reactid="219">How will disputes relating to personal information be resolved?</h4><p data-reactid="220">If there is any dispute or claim that arises out of or relating to your use of the Sweety High Site or this Privacy Policy, you and the Company will attempt in good faith to negotiate a written resolution. If the dispute remains unresolved for forty-five (45) days after notification (via certified mail or personal delivery) that a dispute exists, you and the Company will join in mediation services in Los Angeles, California with a mutually agreed mediator in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Should you file any arbitration claims, or any administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to recover attorney's fees, even if you would otherwise be entitled to them.</p><h4 data-reactid="221">How will you know if we amend this Privacy Policy?</h4><p data-reactid="222">We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time. If we amend this Privacy Policy to permit material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you of such amendment by prominently posting notice of such amendment on the Sweety High Site. Any such amendment to this Privacy Policy will be effective thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on the Sweety High Site. An amendment to this Privacy Policy may permit material changes in the way we use and share personal information that you provided us prior to our notification to you of such amendment. If you do not agree to such changes, your only remedy is to stop using the Sweety High Site and, if you notify us that you do not agree to such changes, we will recommend that you stop using the Sweety High Site. Please be advised, however, that, regardless of whether you provide such notice to us, any such amendment to this Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information that you provide to us on or after the effective date of such amendment.</p><h4 data-reactid="223">Additional Privacy Protections</h4><p data-reactid="224">Additional privacy protection we provide for children under age of 13 on Sweety High site:</p><p data-reactid="225"><!-- react-text: 226 -->We recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections for children who visit the Sweety High Site.
