                <div class="rich-text"><p>Personal data means any
data that identifies or can be used to identify a person. It does not include
data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>

<p>The types of personal
data that we may collect from or about you will depend on which group you fall
into and may include:</p></div>
            
                <div class="rich-text"><p></p><p><b>Individuals working for our customers and suppliers and agents</b><br></p><ul><li>your name(s) and contact details<br></li><li>your job title or role and the department/division/publication you work for<br></li><li>any correspondence we have with you in relation our contractual relationship</li></ul><p></p></div>

                <h2>4. How we use your personal data</h2>
            
                <div class="rich-text"><p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. We will generally rely on one of three legal grounds for using your personal data:</p><p></p><ul><li>where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you&nbsp;<br></li><li>where necessary for our legitimate interests or those of a third party, provided those interests do not override your fundamental rights and interests<br></li><li>where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation<br></li></ul><p></p><p>Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal ground for using your personal data, except in relation to sending you marketing by email or text message. You have the right to withdraw your consent to marketing at any time either by contacting us, clicking the unsubscribe link in an email or replying to a text message with the required words notified to you in each text message.</p><p>Specifically, we will use
your personal data as follows:</p><p></p><ul><li><b>contact details:</b> to respond to your enquiry, contact you in relation to a story or media that you have contributed or administer our contract with you (as appropriate)<br></li><li><b>bank account details:</b> to make any payment that we have agreed to make to you<br></li><li><b>correspondence:</b> to communicate with you in relation to your enquiry, story or contract&nbsp;<br></li><li><b>biographical information and images:</b> to investigate, author and publish journalistic, artistic and/or literary works (subject to the exemptions noted below)</li></ul><p></p></div>
            
                <h2>5. Exemptions</h2>
            
                <div class="rich-text"><p>Data protection law strives to achieve a balance between individuals’ right to privacy and freedom of expression. Although we are required to preserve the confidentiality and security of personal data provided to or obtained by us, the Data Protection Act 2018 includes important exemptions from a number of data protection obligations, including the obligation to provide individuals with information about how we process their personal data, for the purposes of journalism, artistic and literary purposes.</p><p>In order to rely on the exemption, we must show that we processed your personal data (or that of a third party, where relevant) with a view to publication that we reasonably believe to be in the public interest and that complying with various obligations under data protection law would be incompatible with processing personal data for journalistic purposes.</p><p>SWNS honours the&nbsp;Independent Press Standard Organisation&nbsp;Editors’ Code of Practice, even though it is not a member of IPSO.</p></div>
            
                <h2>6. Who we share your personal data with</h2>
            
                <div class="rich-text"><p>We will share your personal data with appropriate members of staff within our organisation.</p><p>We also share your personal data with:</p><p></p><ul><li>where you are an agent or work for one of our customers or suppliers, other businesses within the SWNS Media Group, including 72 Point and OnePoll<br></li><li>service providers including our hosting provider and email marketing platform&nbsp;<br></li><li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs, the tax authority in the UK who require reporting of our processing activities in certain circumstances<br></li><li>any third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or assets or third parties we may seek to acquire or merge with (if any change happens to our business, the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this policy)</li></ul><p></p></div>
            
                <h2>7. Where your personal data are stored</h2>
            
                <div class="rich-text"><p>We do not transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic
Area.</p></div>
            
                <h2>8. How we keep your personal data secure</h2>
            
                <div class="rich-text"><p>We have put in place
appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being
accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or
disclosed. We also limit access to your personal data to those within our
organisation that have a need to access it. They will only process your
personal data on our instructions and they are required to keep your personal
data confidential.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note that any
correspondence with us by email or telephone is not encrypted. If you have any
particular concerns regarding the security of your correspondence with us,
please let us know.</p></div>

                <div class="rich-text"><p>We will only keep your
personal data for as long as necessary in connection with the purposes we
collected it for and to comply with any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.
To determine how long we keep your personal data for, we consider the amount,
nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the purposes for which it was
collected and the potential risk of harm from us continuing to keep it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any email correspondence
that we have had with you will be stored on our email servers, archived and
then deleted in accordance with our back-up and retention policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If we have paid you
anything, we will retain details of the transaction for a period of six years
from the date of the transaction order for tax purposes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will retain personal
data relating to email marketing data until you unsubscribe or your email
address has become permanently unavailable. Once you have unsubscribed, we will
keep a record of your choice indefinitely to ensure that you do not receive any
further emails from us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may retain any data
that does not identify you indefinitely.</p></div>
