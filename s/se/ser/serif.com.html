      <h3>How do we collect Personal Data?</h3>

      <p>From 14th May 2018, we are no longer accepting new serif.com accounts. All sales are now processed via our new website <a href="https://affinity.serif.com">https://affinity.serif.com</a>, and will require an account to be created during the checkout process.

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li><a href="https://affinity.serif.com/privacy/">Affinity privacy and cookies policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://affinity.serif.com/terms/">Affinity terms and conditions</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Existing account holders can still access and update their Personal Data by logging in to their account on Our Website.</p>

      <p>We do still collect a small amount of data from you when you use Our Website. This data is essential in helping us to provide an excellent overall experience for our customers when working with Serif and for helping us to continually improve that experience.</p>

      <p>The data we collect is as follows:</p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>When you visit our Web Site, we use cookies (<a href="#cookies">see below for more information about cookies</a>) to collect web site usage information such as the type and version of browser and operating system you use. Cookies are not used to store personal details such as your name and address.</li>
        <li>We may use “image tracking” to ascertain whether you do or do not read our email communications.</li>
        <li>If you: (a) complete one of our enquiry forms on Our Website; (b) enter into a contract with us for our services; (c) report a problem with Our Website; or (d) otherwise correspond with us, we may collect your name, address (including e-mail address), other contact details, phone numbers, identification and bank details.</li>

        <p>In some cases, we will process your Personal Data based on obtaining your express consent for us to do so. Where this applies, we will always offer you the opportunity to withdraw your consent for this processing at any time.</p></li>

        <li><strong>Contract</strong><br>

      <h3>How secure is your Personal Data?</h3>

      <p>We recognise that people are increasingly concerned about the protection of Personal Data from misuse and abuse, and about privacy in general. We constantly review and enhance our technical, physical and managerial procedures in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of Personal Data in order to protect it from unauthorised access, accidental loss and/or destruction.</p>

      <p>Where necessary, we use industry standard 128-bit secure sockets layer (SSL) technology to encrypt sensitive data.</p>

      <p>It is important for you to remember to protect yourself against unauthorised access by guarding your password. For example, if you use a shared computer, make sure you logout or close your browser whenever you leave the computer.</p>

      <h3>Do we transfer Personal Data overseas?</h3>

      <p>The Internet is a global environment. Using the Internet to collect and process Personal Data involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Although the data we collect from you is stored in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), data transferred to third parties to perform our contract may be transferred to third parties outside the EEA. By browsing Our Website and communicating with us you acknowledge and agree that your Personal Data may be transferred overseas. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

      <h3>Do we monitor and/or record communications?</h3>

      <p>Monitoring or recording of your calls, emails, and other communications may take place in accordance with UK law, and in particular for business purposes, such as for quality control and training, and in order to prevent or detect crime. Please visit the following website for further information: <a href="http://www.ico.org.uk">ico.org.uk</a>.</p>

      <h3>Children</h3>

      <p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed Personal Data to us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@serif.com">dataprotection@serif.com</a>.</p>

      <p>Where processing of Personal Data is based on consent, if we learn that this data belongs to someone under the age of 13, we will cease processing and will take reasonable measures to delete the applicable data from our records, unless the consent is provided by a parent or guardian.</p>
