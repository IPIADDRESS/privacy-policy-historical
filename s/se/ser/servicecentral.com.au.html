	</p>
	<p class="content">
		Service Central uses market research to monitor traffic to and across its web site. This technology involves inserting special scripting in the code of each web page.

	<h3>
		Service Central uses "cookies" to improve your experience
	</h3>
	<p class="content">
		Service Central uses a standard Web browser feature called "cookies" to help us improve your experience. A cookie is a small text file that many web sites write through your browser when you visit them. A cookie can only be read by the site that places it, so Service Central web site cannot "see where you've been" based on any other cookies in your browser. Netscape Navigator uses a single file called "cookies.txt" to record all cookies, and you can open this file in any text editor to see what it looks like.
	</p>
	<p class="content">
		On some areas of www.servicecentral.com.au cookies are used to distinguish you from other users. However, cookies merely provide us with a unique anonymous number that we can use in identifying -- and enhancing -- the use of sections of our site.
	</p>
	<p class="content">
		Cookies can also be used to store your user name and encrypted password, if you so choose. You may choose to disable cookies in your browser or use security software to prevent the storage of cookies. However if you disable cookies, we may not be able to fulfil your request or provide you with an appropriate level of service in some areas of the Service Central web site. Below are instructions to help you disable cookies if you use Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. If these options don't apply to you, Contact Us for further assistance.

		<li>Select Tools -&gt; Internet Options from the menu.</li>
		<li>Select the "Security" tab</li>
		<li>Click the "Custom Level..." button</li>
		<li>In the "Cookies" section make sure that "Allow per-session cookies (not stored)" is set to "Disable"</li>
		<li>Confirm the changes by clicking OK</li>
		<li>Answer "Yes" to the following dialog box</li>
		<li>Close and save your changes by clicking "OK" on the "Internet Options" dialog box.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="content">
