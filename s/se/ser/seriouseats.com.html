				<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

				<p>This privacy statement covers all of the Serious Eats site (“SE site”). Please read this statement carefully before using proceeding to access the Serious Eats site. Your use of the Serious Eats site indicates your agreement to abide by the Terms in effect.</p>

<h2>Information Collection</h2>
<p>Serious Eats is the sole owner of the information collected on the Serious Eats site. Serious Eats may collect information from our users at several different points on the Serious Eats site.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>In order to enhance their use of the Serious Eats site, users can choose to leave comments on particular articles of interest. To leave a comment, users must submit information including a valid email address. Serious Eats uses this information to screen out users who leave comments prohibited by our terms and conditions of use, and will not pass this information to any other organization.</p>

<h2>Mailing List</h2>
<p>Serious Eats may launch a mailing list for the Serious Eats site. In order to sign up to receive regular emails from the site’s mailing list, users must submit information including a valid email address and demographic information such as location and interests. This information will be used in aggregate form only in order to assess general user interest in various internal and third party products and services, and your personal and contact information will not be passed to any other organization. Users who choose to sign up for a mailing list will receive regular emails from the site, including new articles added to the site as well as emails from third party site sponsors. If you do not wish to receive emails from third party advertisers, do not sign up for the mailing list.</p>

<h2>Discussion Group and Cookies</h2>
<p>In order to further enhance the user experience, Serious Eats includes a discussion board service where users can discuss common topics of interest. Users have the option of signing up for this service, and to do so must submit information including a valid email address. Serious Eats uses this information to screen out users who leave comments prohibited by our terms and conditions of use and to pick out topics of interest to discussion board users. Serious Eats will not pass this information to any other organization except in aggregate form.</p>

<p>The discussion board service uses cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.</p>

<p>By setting a cookie on the Serious Eats site, users will not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on the site’s discussion board. We store a cookie on each user's machine that contains a username and encrypted password. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Serious Eats products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings. However, not all Serious Eats services require that you accept cookies.</p>

<h2>Third Party Advertising</h2>
<p>The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by Tribal Fusion, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visits to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad, is used to serve ads to you. For more information about Tribal Fusion, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please click <a href="http://www.tribalfusion.com/TribalFusion/privacy.html">here</a>. 

</p><h2>Third Party Cookies</h2>
<p>In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.</p>

<h2>Log Files</h2>
<p>Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We may use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyze user movement.</p>

<h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, Serious Eats may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on the Serious Eats site.</p>

<h2>Business Transitions</h2>
<p>In the event Serious Eats goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>
<p>The Serious Eats site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Serious Eats is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Serious Eats.</p>

<h2>Third Party Cookies</h2>
