<blockquote><p align="center"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sertifi.com Incorporated ("Sertifi") respects your privacy and has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. This policy governs web sites owned and operated by Sertifi, including <a href="http://www.sertifi.com">www.sertifi.com</a> We have established this Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices to our customers and visitors. This online privacy policy describes how we use, disclose and protect personal information that you share with us. "Personal information" is information that enables us to identify you, such as your name and e-mail address. By using this Site, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Sertifi Support at <a href="mailto:support_ticket@sertifi.com">support_ticket@sertifi.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our purpose in collecting personal information is to provide and assist you in sending and signing agreements and general use of our web contracting platform. We require customers who register to use the services offered on our Sites (collectively, the "Service") to give us contact information, such as their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, and credit card number. When you register for the Service, or when you ask for additional information from Sertifi about the Service, we may also ask you for additional personal information, such as title, department name, fax number, or additional company information, such as annual revenues, number of employees, or industry. Customers can opt out of providing this additional information by not providing it when asked to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sertifi uses the information that we collect to set up the Service for customers and their organizations. We may also use the information to contact customers to discuss customer interest in our company, the Service that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by submitting their email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All financial and billing information that we collect through the Site is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for the Service. This billing information is not used by Sertifi for marketing or promotional purposes. Sertifi uses a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers of the Service will be using the Site to host data and information ("Data"). Sertifi will not share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data except as provided in the Sertifi Terms of Service or as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the Terms of Service or as may be required by law. Of course, customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sertifi may also collect certain information from visitors to and customers of the Site, such as Internet IP addresses. This information is logged to help operate our web contracting service, diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site in order to constantly improve the quality of the Site and our Service. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information ("Aggregated Information") from our visitors and customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name. We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sertifi will not sell or rent your personal information, including customer e-mail addresses, to anyone. We may disclose your personal information to our third party contractors who perform services for Sertifi Incorporated in order to complete or confirm your transaction. These contractors are permitted to use the personal information only for the purposes of such services, unless we have your permission for any other use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sertifi Incorporated may disclose and transfer the information obtained from you through this Site or the Service as part of a merger, acquisition or other sale of its assets or business.<br>
Moreover, we may be legally obligated to disclose information to the government or to third parties under certain circumstances, such as illegal activity on our Site. Sertifi reserves the right to release personal information to its service providers, law enforcement or other government officials or in response to a formal request in a civil action, as Sertifi Incorporated, in our sole and absolute discretion, deems necessary or appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also provide Aggregated Information to third parties. Such information will not include personal information of any customer or visitor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Opt-Out Policy</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, at any time after registering for information or ordering the Service, you change your mind about receiving promotional information from us or about our sharing information with third parties for promotional purposes, send us a request specifying your new choice. Send us an email at <a href="mailto:support_ticket@Sertifi.com">support_ticket@Sertifi.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sertifi reserves the right to send customers certain communications from relating to the Service, such as service announcements and administrative messages, that are considered part of your account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choices about Cookies: You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Sertifi Incorporated products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings.<br>
Our Practices Regarding Cookies: Sertifi uses session and persistent cookies for a number of purposes, including to: access your account information when you "sign in," so that we can provide you with customized content; keep track of preferences you specify while you are using Sertifi services; estimate and report our total audience size and traffic; and conduct research to improve Sertifi Incorporated content and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third Party Cookies: We may from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to our Site to help us administer our Site and improve its quality. Such third parties may use cookies to help track visitor behavior. Such cookies will not be used to associate individual website visitors to any personally identifiable information.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the personal information and Data under our control. Sertifi hosts the Site in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other industry-standard technology to help prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Sertifi also requires that unique user names and passwords must be entered each time a customer logs on to the Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sertifi keeps your account information active in our user registration databases in order to provide immediate access to your personalization preferences and data each time you visit the Site. If you ask Sertifi to delete your Sertifi account, in most cases your account will be deactivated and then deleted from our user registration database in approximately 90 days. This delay is necessary to discourage users from engaging in fraudulent activity. Please note that any information that we have copied may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after your deletion request. This may be the case even though no information about your account remains in our active user databases.</p>
