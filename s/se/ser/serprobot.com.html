					<h2>What is SERP ranking and why should I care?</h2>
					<h3>What is SERP ranking</h3>
					<p>SERP ranking or <strong><i>Search Engine Results Page</i></strong> ranking is basically the position a website appears in a search engines results page.</p>
					<h3>What types of SERP rankings are there?</h3>
					<p>There are many different types of SERPS but three main categories</p>
					<ul style="list-style: circle">
						<li><strong>Organic SERPS</strong> These are the natural results that the search engine has selected as being the most relevant to your search query and the most useful to the user</li>
						<li><strong>Paid SERPS</strong> These are paid for by site owners and provide an easy way to jump the natural selection process and become more prominent to the searcher. Usually there is a charge for each click that the advertiser receives and the site willing to pay the most per click will gain the highest position.</li>
						<li><strong>Contextual SERPS</strong> These are generated by the context that the search keywords provide and can come in many forms like maps, for a local search, hotel reviews for a booking related query, images for a visual related search or even business reviews for a specific service query.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Why is my ranking important?</h3>
					<p>If you are running a website then most of your potential visitors will be provided by search engines and the better your SERP ranking then the more visitors you will receive.</p>
					<p>It has been shown in a great number of user tests that just the top 3 SERP positions get over 35% of the search traffic and 75% of users never click past the first page</p>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<h4>Google Search User Heatmap</h4>
						<img src="/img/google-heat-map.jpg" alt="google search heat map" title="top 3 SERP positions get over 35% of traffic">
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<h4>Some Search Statistics</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>93% of websites visits are referrals from a search engine.</li>
							<li>70% of the links search users click on are organic.</li>
							<li>70-80% of users completely ignore the paid ads, simply focusing on the organic results.</li>
							<li>75% of users never view past the first page of search results.</li>
							<li>Google has shown that 18% of clicks go to the first SERP position, 10% of clicks go to the second position, and 7% of organic clicks go to the third position.</li>
							<li>Bing claims that 9.7% of organic clicks go to #1, 5.5% go to #2, and 2.7% #3.</li>
							<li>There are more than 100 billion searches being conducted each month globally.</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div class="clearfix"></div>
					<h3>How are organic SERP rankings generated?</h3>
					<p>All the major search engines have vast amounts of data about the sites they index and for each search query they must rank these sites according to 100's of different criteria to provide what they see as the best and most useful results.<br>They deliberately don't disclose how their ranking methods work to prevent manipulation and are constantly changing or fine tuning the weight of criteria to produce more relevant results.<br> However over years of careful study, the online community has managed to narrow down the most important and influential factors:
					</p><ul style="list-style: circle">
						<li>Search keywords or terms related in the pages title, heading tags, image tags etc.</li>
						<li>Relevant, original body content including search keywords or terms related.</li>
						<li>Not over optimised with a high proportion of keywords within the overall site (somewhere between 2 to 5% is best).</li>
						<li>Enough content to be valuable - over 200 words is mostly classed as acceptable.</li>
						<li>The quantity and quality of incoming links using the search keywords as anchor text.</li>
						<li>Rich media such as images or video to improve user experience.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>News</h2>
					<h2>SERPLAB rebranding to SERPROBOT <small>4 June, 2018</small></h2>
					<p>In December we were notified by a company that they had registered our name "SERPLAB" as a trademark in the UK and informed us that we needed to stop using it!</p>
					<p>After getting legal advice we decided that rather than risk the service in a long legal dispute possibly costing 1000's of $ and countless hours of stress over just a name, it would make more sense to focus on important things (like finishing the final version) and agreed to rebrand.</p>
					<p>As of the 7th of June we will be changing to the domain <a href="https://www.serprobot.com">https://www.serprobot.com</a> and our name will switch to SERPROBOT - Everything else will stay the same!</p>
					<p>We will be redirecting anyone who visits <a href="http://www.serplab.co.uk">www.serplab.co.uk</a> so even if you forget you will still be able to find us :-)</p>
					<p>All APIs will continue to work on the old domain (serplab.co.uk) and on the new one so your existing integrations won't break and will not need updating.</p>
					<p>If you would like more information then just email us as usual on <a href="mailto:info@serplab.co.uk">info@serplab.co.uk</a> (soon to be <a href="mailto:info@serprobot.com">info@serprobot.com</a>)</p>

					<h2>How Can I Improve My SERP Ranking?</h2>
					<p>SEO or <strong><i>Search Engine Optimisation</i></strong> is a vast topic and there are many theories on how to achieve the coveted #1 search engine position, but basically it boils down to two distinct areas: <strong>on page optimisation</strong> and <strong>link building</strong></p>
					<h4>On Page Optimisation</h4>
					<p>This is the process of creating a well designed, user friendly, relevant and useful site which is targeted towards a specific niche and targeting specific terms i.e. "SERP CHECKING".<br> There are specific best practices to be observed and basic guidelines to be followed which are beyond the scope of this but you can find more info and a good free site test at <a href="http://woorank.com" rel="nofollow" title="SEO checker">WooRank SEO checker</a> - N.B these are just guidelines and provide basic a benchmark to ensure no grave mistakes have been made, a site can rank #1 with many items these testing sites flag as major problems.</p>
					<h4>Link Building</h4>
					<p>Search engines treat incoming links to your site as votes for how relevant it is. The text used for these links is the strongest signal all search engines use to rate your sites relevance to search queries.<br> Links are rated by the relevance and authority the linking site has and the more relevance the link will pass. So good high quality links are by far the best way to get a SERP ranking position.</p>

						<li><strong>Advertising.</strong> We work with third-party advertising partners to show you ads that we think may interest you. These advertising partners may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies on our Services, and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you which they may collect over time and across different online services. Some of our advertising partners are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance. To learn more about these programs, or opt-out of personalized ads, visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory program for Online Behavioral Advertising at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info</a>, or the Network Advertising Initiative at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</li>
						<li><strong>Analytics.</strong> We use analytics providers such as Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect non-identifying information. Google provides some additional privacy options regarding its Analytics cookies at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.</li>
						<li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> Information may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to any potential acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any proposed merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.</li>

						<li><strong>With Your Consent.</strong> We may share information with your consent.</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>4. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
					<p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
					<p>However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you; (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights; or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.  We have a legitimate interest in operating our Services and communicating with you as necessary to provide these Services, for example when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.</p>
					<p>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>
					<p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).</p>
					<h4>5. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h4>
					<p>You may access other third-party services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those third-party services from within the Services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these third-party services, and we encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies.</p>
					<h4>6. DATA RETENTION</h4>
					<p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).</p>
					<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
					<h4>7. ACCESS</h4>
					<p>If you are a registered user, you may access certain information associated with your Account by logging into our Services or emailing info@serprobot.com. If you terminate your Account, any public activity on your Account prior to deletion may remain stored on our servers and may remain accessible to the public.</p>
					<p>To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before updating or removing your information. The information you provide us may be archived or stored periodically by us according to backup processes conducted in the ordinary course of business for disaster recovery purposes. Your ability to access and correct your information may be temporarily limited where access and correction could: inhibit SERPROBOT's ability to comply with a legal obligation; inhibit SERPROBOT's ability to investigate, make or defend legal claims; result in disclosure of personal information about a third party; or result in breach of a contract or disclosure of trade secrets or other proprietary business information belonging to SERPROBOT or a third party.</p>
					<h4>8. YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS UNDER THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR)</h4>
					<p>If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the following data protection rights:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>If you wish to access, correct, update, or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by emailing info@serprobot.com.</li>
						<li>In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information, or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by emailing info@serprobot.com.</li>
						<li>You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the "unsubscribe" or "opt-out" link in the marketing emails we send you. To opt-out of other forms of marketing, please contact us by emailing info@serprobot.com.</li>
						<li>Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>
						<li>You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
					<h4>9. YOUR CHOICES</h4>
					<p>You can use some of the features of the Services without registering, thereby limiting the type of information that we collect.</p>
					<p>You may unsubscribe from receiving certain promotional emails from us. If you wish to do so, simply follow the instructions found at the end of the email. Even if you unsubscribe, we may still contact you for informational, transactional, account-related, or similar purposes.</p>
					<p>Many browsers have an option for disabling cookies, which may prevent your browser from accepting new cookies or enable selective use of cookies. Please note that, if you choose not to accept cookies, some features and the personalization of our Services may no longer work for you. You will continue to receive advertising material but it will not be tailored to your interests.</p>
					<h4>10. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h4>
					<p>SERPROBOT  does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13, and children under 13 are prohibited from using our Services. If you learn that a child has provided us with personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy, you can alert us at info@serprobot.com.</p>
					<h4>11. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
					<p>This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time, so please review it frequently. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on our websites. If we materially change the ways in which we use or share personal information previously collected from you through our Services, we will notify you through our Services, by email, or other communication.</p>
					<h4>12. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h4>
					<p>SERPROBOT  is a global business. We may transfer personal information to countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer your personal information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
