<div id="share">
<h2>6. With whom we share Personal Information</h2>
<p>
As part of the provision of our Service, and the operation of our Site, we may share some of your Personal Information with third parties.
In some cases, this disclosure is necessary because these third parties are essential to the provision of our Services to you.
In other cases, sharing your information with a third party allows us to provide you with content that is better adapted to your needs.
This sharing is not required; you have the right to opt-out of this sharing as indicated in our User’s Rights section.
We explain below why and with whom we may share your Personal Information.
</p><ul>
<li>
<span>Tradesmen</span>If you have requested to receive quotes from Tradesmen, we may share your Personal Information with Tradesmen that might be able to fulfill the services requested by you. You have the right to opt out of this sharing. See our User’s Rights section.
</li>
<li>
<span>Affiliated entities</span>We may share Personal Information with our affiliated companies in connection with our sales and marketing process. This sharing enables us to provide the User with information about our Services that might be of interest to that User and coordinate activities among the different entities in our group of companies. To the extent that any of our affiliated entities has access to your Personal Information, it will follow the practices described in this Privacy Notice.
</li>
<li>
<span>Business partners</span>We may team up with other companies (“business partners”) to offer certain promotions.

Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of our business partners.
</li>
<li>
<span>Service providers</span>We may engage certain third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation,
hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, storage, database management, credit card processing, collection, fraud prevention,

We will share your Personal Information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide
such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of
your Personal Information.
</li>
<li>
<span>Targeted marketing</span>We may contract with publishers and advertising agencies to serve targeted advertisements about us to individuals who have visited our site so that our advertisements are presented to these individuals while they are visiting a third party’s website. This is accomplished by combining cookies and action tags that are shared with these third parties, and in accordance with the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act. We believe that if you have visited our Site you may be more interested in seeing advertisements about our Services – and more likely to use these Services.
</li>
<li>
<span>To defend or enforce our rights</span>We may use or share Personal Information to protect ourselves or protect the Site, to establish or exercise our legal rights, to respond to a breach of our Terms of Service, when we believe it is appropriate to protect our property and rights or those of a third party; to protect the safety of our company, our Users or others; to investigate, prevent, take action against, or stop any fraudulent, illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, in connection with our Site or our Service.
</li>
<li>
<span>Business transfers</span>If any or all of our assets are acquired by, or merged with, those of another entity, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, we may disclose, share or transfer some or all of our Users’ Personal Information to or with this entity in preparation for the transaction, as part of the due diligence process, or after the transaction has been consummated, so that the successor entity can continue providing our Services to our Users. If the recipient of the Personal Information has Personal Information practices that do not meet the substance of this Privacy Notice, you will be given the opportunity not to continue to use the Site.
</li>
<li>
<span>Compliance with laws and third party requests</span>We co-operate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our reasonable discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to and defend against legal claims, respond to legal process (including a facially valid subpoena, warrant, court order or other legal process), or otherwise as required by law.
</li>
Please note that we may not be able to notify you of a request for the disclosure of your information as described above, either because it might be prohibited by law, or because doing so would jeopardize an investigation into illegal or fraudulent activity, or because we do not have your contact information.
