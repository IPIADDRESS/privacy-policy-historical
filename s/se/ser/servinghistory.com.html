<h1>Serving History : Privacy</h1>
<br>
<br>
PLEASE READ TERMS BEFORE USING THIS SERVICE. BY CONTINUING TO USE Serving History, YOU AGREE TO ABIDE BY THE CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br>

Thank you for visiting the Serving History site. We are committed to the privacy of our visitors. We collect no personal information about you when you visit our Web site unless you choose to provide that information to us.<br>
<br>
Here is how we handle information about your visit to our Web site.<br>
<br>
<h2>Information collected and stored automatically:</h2><br>
<br>
"Cookies" are small bits of text that are either used for the duration of a session ("session cookies") or saved on a user's hard drive in order to identify that user, or information about that user, the next time the user logs on the a Web site ("persistent cookies").

This information does not identify you personally. Like most every site you visit on the Internet, we automatically collect and store information like the following concerning your visit:<br>

<li>Your IP address;<br>
</li><li>The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;<br>
</li><li>The date and time you access our site;<br>
</li><li>The pages you visit; and If you linked to our Web site from another Web site, the address of that Web site.<br>
</li></ul><br>
<br>
We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors, to learn about the number of visitors to our site, and the types of technology our visitors use. We do not automatically or without notification track or record defining information about individuals and their visits.<br>
<br>
<h2>Information protection:</h2><br>
<br>
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this hosting computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. If such monitoring reveals evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity, such evidence may be provided to appropriate law enforcement officials. Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information on this server are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act or other law.<br>
<br>
<h2>Information that you voluntarily provide:</h2><br>
<br>
We do not collect personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide it to us. If you provide us with personally identifiable information, for example, by sending an e-mail or by filling out a form and submitting it through Serving History, we use that information to respond to your message and to help us provide you with the information and services that you request. All uses of that information are described on the Web page containing the form.<br>
<br>
Submitting voluntary information constitutes your consent to the use of the information for the stated purpose. When you click the "Submit" button on any of the Web forms found on our sites, you are indicating your voluntary consent to use of the information you submit for the purpose stated.<br>

<br>
<h2>How information is used:</h2><br>
<br>
The information we collect is used for a variety of purposes as described above. We make every effort to disclose clearly how information is used at the point where it is collected so you can determine whether you wish to provide the information.<br>
<br>
<h2>Retention of Information:</h2><br>
<br>
We destroy the information we collect when the purpose for which it was provided has been fulfilled unless we are required to keep it longer by statute or official policy. Electronically submitted information is maintained and destroyed according to the principles of the Federal Records Act and the regulations and records schedules approved by the National Archives and Records Administration, and in some cases information submitted to us may become an agency record and therefore might be subject to a Freedom of Information Act request.<br>
