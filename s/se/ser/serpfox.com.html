			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>Serpfox operates several websites including Serpfox.com. It is Serpfox�s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

<h3>Website Visitors</h3>

<p>Like most website operators, Serpfox collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Serpfox�s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Serpfox�s visitors use its website. From time to time, Serpfox may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

<p>Certain visitors to Serpfox�s websites choose to interact with Serpfox in ways that require Serpfox to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Serpfox gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, Serpfox collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor�s interaction with Serpfox. Serpfox does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<p>Serpfox discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Serpfox�s behalf or to provide services available at Serpfox�s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Serpfox�s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Serpfox will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Serpfox discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena or court order, or when Serpfox believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Serpfox, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Serpfox website and have supplied your email address, Serpfox may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what�s going on with Serpfox and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Serpfox takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor�s computer, and that the visitor�s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Serpfox uses cookies to help Serpfox identify and track visitors, their usage of Serpfox website, and their website access preferences. Serpfox visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Serpfox�s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Serpfox�s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h3>Ads</h3>

<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Serpfox and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Serpfox may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Serpfox�s sole discretion. Serpfox encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.</p>		</div>
