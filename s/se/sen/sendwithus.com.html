                                        you. This unique identifier is associated with a

                                        in persistent cookies. For example, the Company does

                                        Techdrop Labs uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction
                                        with cookies to compile information about Customers and
                                        Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web site and interaction
                                        with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear
                                        electronic images that can recognize certain types of
                                        information on your computer, such as cookies, when you
                                        viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web beacon, and a
                                        description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon. For
                                        example, Techdrop Labs may place Web beacons in marketing
                                        emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in
                                        the email that directs you to one of the Company’s Web site.
                                        Techdrop Labs uses Web beacons to operate and improve the
                                        Company’s Web site and email communications.
