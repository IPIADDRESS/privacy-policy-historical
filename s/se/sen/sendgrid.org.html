In those circumstances, we receive personal data from the EU as an agent for the customer or other third party merely for processing and are not required to apply the Safe Harbor principles to that information.

        DISCLOSURE AS REQUIRED BY LAW.
        </h3>
        <p>
        Though we make every reasonable effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personally identifiable information of certain users of the Site or Services when we have a reasonable and good-faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to enforce the Terms of Use for the Site, comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal process, or to otherwise enforce or protect SendGrid's rights under applicable law, including, without limitation, SendGrid's intellectual property rights. In this situation we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of this disclosure to all affected users, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances.
        </p>
        <h3>
        ENHANCEMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.

        <p>
        We may combine and enhance the information we collect from our users with third party data and information to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers in which we think our users would be interested. Certain summary demographics are also used in our research product offerings.

        <h3>
        SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.
        </h3>
        <p>
        On occasion it is necessary to send out service related announcements. For instance, if the Site or any of the Services is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. We also communicate with users to provide customer service in accordance with our Terms of Service. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications without also deactivating their account and ceasing use of the Services. These communications are not promotional in nature.
        </p>
        <h3>
        SPECIAL OFFERS AND UPDATES.
        </h3>
        <p>

Established members may occasionally also receive information on products, services and special deals, and periodic newsletters. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out section.
        </p>
        <h3>
        YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.
        </h3>
        <p>
        California law provides that California residents have a right to request that businesses tell them how their personally identifiable information has been shared with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes. However, there is an exception to this requirement for businesses that have adopted and disclosed, in their privacy policy, a policy of not disclosing a person's personally identifiable information to third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes if that person has exercised an option to opt-out of the disclosure of their personally identifiable information to third parties for such purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
        SendGrid has adopted a policy of allowing you to opt-out of the disclosure of your personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes and thus falls within this exception. Instructions for opting out can be found in the section below entitled "Choice and Opt-Out."
        </p>
        <h3>
        CHOICE AND OPT-OUT.
        </h3>
        <p>
        We provide you with a choice whether to receive certain emails and other communications through the Site and Services.
        </p>
        <p>
        We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes. If you are a user of the Site or Services and you no longer wish to receive emails or other communications from us or have your email address or other contect information shared with third parties, you may opt-out of receiving email or other communications from us or having your email address or other contact information shared with third parties. Some communications (e.g. important account notifications and billing information) are considered transactional and are necessary for all SendGrid customers. Customers must cancel your SendGrid account to unsubscribe you from these communications.
        </p>
        <p>
        In addition, if you would prefer that we not share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, you may opt-out of having your personally identifiable information shared with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p><p>All opt-out requests can be made by emailing us at: <a href="mailto:legal@sendgrid.com" title="legal@sendgrid.com">legal@sendgrid.com</a>. Please note that it may take up to 10 days to remove your contact information from our marketing communications lists, so you may receive correspondence from us for a short time after you make your request.</p>

        <p>
        In addition to the specific third parties noted in this Policy, SendGrid may also contract with Agents to provide various services to SendGrid relating to the Site or Services on an outsourced basis rather than performing the services itself (as used here, "Agents" are persons on companies who act on behalf of or under the direction of SendGrid).
