<h3>
USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE EU.
</h3>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When SendGrid is a data controller</strong>. SendGrid adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles as described in this Policy with respect to the personal data we collect from EU data subjects, which includes data used to establish accounts, process orders, process payments and otherwise provide the Services. We have certified our compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles to the United States Department of Commerce, and our certification can be found at <a href="http://safeharbor.export.gov" title="safeharbor.export.gov">safeharbor.export.gov</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When SendGrid is a data processor</strong>. SendGrid’s obligations with respect to personal data for which we are solely a data processor, such as personal data received from our customers or from other third parties that we use to generate and transmit email and other communications through the Services, are defined in our agreements with those customers and are not included in this Policy. In those circumstances, we receive personal data from the EU as an agent for the customer or other third party merely for processing and are not required to apply the Safe Harbor principles to that information. In those circumstances, our customers or those other third parties will remain responsible for personal data that they collect and for compliance with the applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>
COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION BY SENDGRID.
</h3>
<p>
Where possible, our server automatically recognizes and collects certain non-personally identifiable information regarding visitors to the Site and users of the Services, including by way of example, IP address, browser type, and other information regarding the system and connection of each visitor or user. We also collect information about how visitors access and use the Site and Services, including by way of example what pages of the Site are viewed and what portions of services are used. When providing the Services, we collect information regarding the performance of the Services, which includes metrics related to the deliverability of emails and other electronic communications. This information allows us to improve the content of the Site and Services, facilitate research and analysis of the Site and Services, and develop and refine our Services. Sometimes, we utilize the services of a third party to help us understand this information better, although the information that is disclosed to these entities remains at all times in anonymous and non-personally identifiable form. We may also provide this information to our customers in anonymous and non-personally identifiable form.
</p>
<h3>
CHILDREN.
</h3>
<p>
The Site and Services are not directed to children under 13 years of age. SendGrid does not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.
</p>
<h3>
SENSITIVE INFORMATION.
</h3>
<p>
SendGrid does not knowingly solicit or collect, and you should not provide, any information regarding your medical or health condition, race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or other sensitive information.
</p>
<h3>
DISCLOSURE AS REQUIRED BY LAW.
</h3>
<p>
Though we make every reasonable effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personally identifiable information of certain users of the Site or Services when we have a reasonable and good-faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to enforce the Terms of Use for the Site, comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal process, or to otherwise enforce or protect SendGrid's rights under applicable law, including, without limitation, SendGrid's intellectual property rights. In this situation we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of this disclosure to all affected users, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances.
</p>
<h3>
ENHANCEMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.
</h3>
<p>
We may combine and enhance the information we collect from our users with third party data and information to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers in which we think our users would be interested. Certain summary demographics are also used in our research product offerings. Individual personally identifiable information we collect is never used in our research product offering and is never tied back to an individual user or resold for any purposes.
</p>
<h3>
SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.
</h3>
<p>
On occasion it is necessary to send out service related announcements. For instance, if the Site or any of the Services is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. We also communicate with users to provide customer service in accordance with our Terms of Service. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications without also deactivating their account and ceasing use of the Services. These communications are not promotional in nature.
</p>
<h3>
SPECIAL OFFERS AND UPDATES.
</h3>
<p>
We may send new registrants of the Site or Services a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members may occasionally also receive information on products, services and special deals, and periodic newsletters. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out section.
</p>
<h3>
YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.
</h3>
<p>
California law provides that California residents have a right to request that businesses tell them how their personally identifiable information has been shared with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes. However, there is an exception to this requirement for businesses that have adopted and disclosed, in their privacy policy, a policy of not disclosing a person's personally identifiable information to third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes if that person has exercised an option to opt-out of the disclosure of their personally identifiable information to third parties for such purposes.
</p>
<p>
SendGrid has adopted a policy of allowing you to opt-out of the disclosure of your personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes and thus falls within this exception. Instructions for opting out can be found in the section below entitled "Choice and Opt-Out."
</p>
<h3>
CHOICE AND OPT-OUT.
</h3>
<p>
We provide you with a choice whether to receive certain emails and other communications through the Site and Services.
</p>
<p>
We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes. If you are a user of the Site or Services and you no longer wish to receive emails or other communications from us or have your email address or other contect information shared with third parties, you may opt-out of receiving email or other communications from us or having your email address or other contact information shared with third parties. Some communications (e.g. important account notifications and billing information) are considered transactional and are necessary for all SendGrid customers. Customers must cancel your SendGrid account to unsubscribe you from these communications.
</p>
<p>
In addition, if you would prefer that we not share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, you may opt-out of having your personally identifiable information shared with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All opt-out requests can be made by emailing us at: <a href="mailto:legal@sendgrid.com" title="legal@sendgrid.com">legal@sendgrid.com</a>. Please note that it may take up to 10 days to remove your contact information from our marketing communications lists, so you may receive correspondence from us for a short time after you make your request.</p>

<p>
"Web beacons" (also known as "single-pixel" or "clear" GIFs) include electronic images imbedded in the Site or in communications sent through the Services which are invisible to users.

</p>
<p>
We may use an outside advertisement serving company to display advertisements on the Site or in communications sent through the Services. The advertisement serving company may place and collect cookies or web beacons when it displays an advertisement on the Site or through the Services. We do not have access to information that would confirm the use of cookies or web beacons by the advertisement serving company. We may also use a third party provider to analyze data and patterns regarding usage of the Site and the communications sent through Services. This third party provider may use cookies or web beacons to collect such information.
</p>
<p>
Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You may also be able to refuse certain web beacons by adjusting the settings on your browser or email software. Please refer to your browser or email software instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.

We will use at least industry standard security measures on the Site to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

For example, our policy is that only those individuals who need your personally identifiable information to perform a specific job are granted access to that personally identifiable information. Likewise, all employees and contractors are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.
