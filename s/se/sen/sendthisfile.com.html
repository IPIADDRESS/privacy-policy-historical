        <p align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>
        Last Updated: November 22, 2013


        <p>
            This privacy policy (the "Statement") covers SendThisFile,
            Inc's ("SendThisFile," "us," or "our") SendThisFile file transfer service
            website, sendthisfile.com. By using the SendThisFile website, you consent to
            the data practices described in this Statement, as the same may be updated from
            time to time.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>Scope</h3>

        <p>
            This Statement covers SendThisFile's treatment of personally
            identified information that we collect when you are on the SendThisFile
            website, and when you use our services. This Statement also covers our
            treatment of any personally identified information that our business partners
            share with us.
        </p>


        <p>
            This Statement does not apply to the practices of companies
            that SendThisFile does not own or control, or to individuals that SendThisFile
            does not employ or manage, including operators of websites to which you may
            link from the SendThisFile website. This Statement also does not apply to any
            offline collection of personally identified information, or the treatment of
            the same when such information is collected outside of the SendThisFile
            website.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>What information do we gather?</h3>

        <p>
            The only individually identified information that we collect
            about you is that which you choose to share with us during registration, when
            using our products and services, or when responding to offers from SendThisFile
            or from our business partners.
        </p>


        <p>We also collect information about aggregate site usage.
            Statistics that we gather about unique visits, referring URLs, repeat visits
            and page views are all based on IP address, and are not associated with your
            personal information.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>Why do we ask for personal information about you?</h3>

        <p>In order to use the SendThisFile service, users must set up
            individual accounts. This requires the completion of a registration form. This
            information is used to identify the specific individual utilizing the
            SendThisFile service. Users may provide optional identifying information,
            demographic information, and unique identifiers to enable us to provide a more
            personalized experience on the site.</p>


        <p>We share aggregate information (information that is not
            specifically identified to you) with our partners and advertisers. We will not
            share your personally identified information with any third party, unless we
            tell you otherwise when we collect the information, you have consented by
            "opting in" to being contacted by SendThisFile, its third party
            partners or advertisers, or we have informed you of a change to our Statement
            so that you can then choose to opt out. We will give you a way to "opt
            out" of being contacted by SendThisFile.</p>


        <p>In short, the information you provide us can help us to
            understand how to make our website more convenient and useful to our audience.</p>


        <p>We also collect information about aggregate website usage.
            Statistics that we gather about unique visits, repeat visits and page views are
            all based on IP address, not on your individual activities.</p>


        <p>The information we gather is supplemented with information
            provided by third party sources, and may be used to derive additional data to
            enhance our databases. For example, zip code information you provide may be
            used to derive city and state information or may be used to add demographics
            data.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>How do you update the information you provided during
            registration?</h3>

        <p>To update or correct the personally identified information
            that you shared with us during registration, sign into your member account on
            the website using your member ID and password. Once signed in, click on the
            "my account" link, and follow the steps to edit your member information
            and to confirm your changes.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>Email Communications</h3>

        <p>Periodically, we will use your provided email address for the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To send you System Alert Messages to let you know about temporary or permanent
                changes to our Services including planned outages, new features offered, feature
                updates, point releases, major releases, abuse warnings, changes to our Privacy
                Policy and possibly other documents and agreements.
            </li>
            <li>To communicate with you concerning your account for an informational, as
                opposed to promotional, purpose.
            </li>
            <li>To send you informational and promotional materials that you elect ("opt-in")
                to receive.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Our email marketing is permission based. If you received a mailing from us, our
            records indicate that (a) you have expressly shared this address for the purpose
            of receiving information in the future ("opt-in"), or (b) you have registered or
            purchased or otherwise have an existing relationship with us.</p>

        <p>Unsubscribing - You can unsubscribe or change your subscription to our marketing
            emails at any time. Simply click the unsubscribe link that appears at the bottom of
            your email to modify your subscriptions online.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>Third Parties</h3>

        <p>We do not share personally identified information with
            anyone, unless we need to do so to provide services to you (e.g., sending
            credit card information to a credit card processor), we tell you otherwise when
            we collect the information, you "opt in" to having your information
            shared with third parties, or we have informed you of a change to this
            Statement so that you can then choose to opt out. Additionally, we may disclose
            personally identified information with third parties if (1) we believe in good
            faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with an applicable law, a
            valid legal process, or to exercise our legal rights (including, without
            limitation, a violation of the SendThisFile website <i>Terms and Conditions of
                Use</i> or other agreement between SendThisFile and you), or to defend against
            legal claims; (2) we have a good faith belief that access, preservation, or
            disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to protect the rights,
            property, or safety of us, our users, or the public, including disclosure of
            criminal activity or the violation of the rights of others; or (3) if all or a
            portion of a business of SendThisFile is transferred in connection with a sale,
            merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether assets, stock, or
            otherwise).</p>


        <p>Except as stated above, when we ask you for personally
            identified information, we will tell you if we intend to share it with others.
            We will provide you with a way to tell us that you don't want us to share the
            information or if you don't want to receive promotional and/or marketing
            information about products, services, and offerings from SendThisFile and/or
            any third parties. We will also provide you with a way to update your
            personally identified information that you share with us during registration.
            Once you have "opted in" and agreed that your information may be
            shared with third parties or you have responded to an offer by any third party
            on the SendThisFile websites, SendThisFile can no longer update any of your
            personally identified information that has been transferred to such third
            parties or opt you out of such third parties so that you no longer receive
            their promotional and/or marketing information. Instead, you must either
            contact that third party or refer to their privacy policy to update your
            personally identified information or to let them know that you no longer want
            to receive promotional and/or marketing information about their products, services,
            or offerings. The privacy policies and practices of these third parties may
            differ from this Statement. You may not opt-out of the uses stated above or our
            internal uses of your personally identified information.</p>


        <p>SendThisFile may, from time-to-time use the names of
            businesses that have accounts with SendThisFile in SendThisFile's marketing or
            advertising materials, in order to show prospective customers the types of
            businesses that have accounts with SendThisFile. If you do not want
            SendThisFile to use your company name in this manner, send an email to <a href="mailto:legal@sendthisfile.com" class="stfEmailLegal">legal@sendthisfile.com</a> and so state. We
            will send you a confirmation email. Make sure that you receive the confirmation
            email so as to assure that the transaction was completed.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>How does SendThisFile use cookies?</h3>

        <p>SendThisFile uses cookies to facilitate the login process
            for you across multiple applications on our websites. Everything we learn from
            your activity will be used to enrich your experience on our websites. It will
            help us understand what you like and don't like, so we can focus our energies
            more effectively and provide you with better service. There are two types of
            cookies that we use.</p>


        <p align="left" style="text-align:left">The first type of
            cookie has no personal information attached to it and is used to count unique
            users. That cookie can also be used for advertising purposes by SendThisFile,
            its business partners and advertisers, for serving and delivering advertising
            campaigns to control frequency of exposure, or to target by domain name, time
            zone or geographic location.</p>


        <p>For any user who subsequently registers with our site, we
            replace the first type of cookie with a user identified cookie, which we
            continue to use for unique user counting as well as advertising targeting, but
            that cookie may now also include personally identified information. This cookie
            allows you to access all of your personalized areas of the website without
            having to log on multiple times.</p>


        <p>Lastly, there may be a third party cookie in SendThisFile
            emails that is generated by our business partners or advertisers when they
            sponsor emails to promote their products and services.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>Changes to the SendThisFile Privacy Policy</h3>

        <p>SendThisFile may amend this Statement from time to time. If
            we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we
            will notify you by posting a prominent notice in this Statement or in other
            locations on our website or by sending you an email to inform you of an updated
            Statement, at our choice. We encourage you to periodically review this
            Statement to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information
            we collect. Your continued use of the SendThisFile website constitutes your
            agreement to this Statement and any changes to it.</p>
