    <p>Sentara Healthcare is dedicated to protecting the privacy of website users. As a user
    of our website, you will have access to comprehensive information that will help you to
    understand certain illnesses, find accurate, in-depth details about local services and
    providers, and take charge of your personal health.</p>
    <p>Sentara wants you to feel as comfortable as possible when visiting our website and
    using the services it offers. This Privacy Statement tells you what information we
    collect, how we protect it and what choices you have about how that information is used.
    Your privacy refers to any information that is collected about you while interacting with
    Sentara.com.</p>
    <p>Sentara may revise these terms and conditions at any time. We will clearly display
    changes if and when they occur, so that you will always know what information is being
    collected, how it is being used, and under what circumstances it is being disclosed.
    Please review this document periodically to be aware of any changes posted, because your
    continued use of the site will indicate your approval of all changes.</p>
    <p>We urge you to read the following Privacy Statement so that you will understand both
    our commitment to you and your privacy, and how you can participate in that commitment.</p>
    <b></b></font><p><font face="Arial, helvetica" size="2"><b>Collection of Information</b><br>
    By using this web site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as
    discussed in this section. </font></p>
    <font face="Arial, helvetica" size="2"><p>Generally, personal information is not requested
    or collected. However, some features offered on Sentara.com require you to register first
    and provide basic, personal information.</p>
    <p>The first time you register, you will be asked to choose a user name and password and
    provide basic information. Record your password and protect it for future use. If you
    forget your password, you can reset or change your password online. You have access to
    your information collected during the registration process, and may choose to update or
    change your information at anytime with the I.D. and password that you created.</p>
    <p>Sentara also collects information that you volunteer through electronic forms such as
    "<a href="../contactus/Default.cfm" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>" and "<a href="../forms/senior_care_options.asp" target="_blank">Care Options</a>". For some
    "transactions" on Sentara.com, certain information is required to process your
    request. When information is requested from you, Sentara attempts to clearly indicate
    which information is required and which information is optional. Information collected to
    process specific transactions is only used for the specific service that you have chosen.
    However, throughout Sentara's website you are offered opportunities to receive related or
    general information in the future from Sentara. In cases like these, Sentara will ask for
    your "permission" to contact you (see next section for more).</p>
    </font><p><font face="Arial, helvetica" size="2">Overall, your information is used to maintain accuracy in Sentara's customer files,
    improve the content of Sentara.com, and enhance Sentara products and services.</font><font size="2"> </font></p>
    <font face="Arial, helvetica" size="2"><b></b></font><p><font face="Arial, helvetica" size="2"><b>How Sentara Uses Your Information</b><br>
    Sentara does not sell, trade, rent or share your personal information to organizations
    outside Sentara Healthcare and its affiliate companies unless required to do so by legal,
    judicial or governmental proceedings.</font></p>
    <font face="Arial, helvetica" size="2"><p>Sentara reserves the right to store and use any
    information you voluntarily provide for marketing and communications specific to Sentara
    without additional notice. However, Sentara will make every effort to get your permission
    ("opt-in") for Sentara to contact you in the future. You will also have the
    option of respectfully requesting that Sentara not contact you ("opt-out").</p>
    <p>Lastly, the information collected about the domain name of the server from which you
    are visiting is collected in aggregate and used to determine the number of visitors to our
    site, sources of traffic, and other key indicators of website usage to create a better
    experience for visitors to Sentara.com. This information does not identify you personally.</p>
    <b></b></font><p><font face="Arial, helvetica" size="2"><b>Sponsoring Organizations</b><br>
    Sentara works with various organizations to improve and enhance its website. Where Sentara
    has entered into a relationship with such an organization, Sentara requires the respective
    organization to fully disclose their business practices including a privacy statement.
    Sentara encourages you to read the disclosure statements of any such organization so that
    you are aware of any differences from its own disclosure statements.</font></p>
    <font face="Arial, helvetica" size="2"><b></b></font><p><font face="Arial, helvetica" size="2"><b>Cookies</b><br>
    In some instances, Sentara stores a cookie -- a small computer file -- on your computer to
    make it easier for you to use various Web services on our website. Sometimes, a cookie
    will be required in order to establish and maintain a secure session so that you can
    request data and conduct business transactions without having to re-enter information.
    "Cookies" vary in the amount of time they are valid depending on the specific
    application or service.</font><font size="2"> </font></p>
