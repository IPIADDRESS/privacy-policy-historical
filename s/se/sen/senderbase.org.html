            <h3>Privacy Practices</h3>
            <p>The following statement discloses consumer privacy practices for all of the Websites of IronPort Systems, Inc., including those of its subsidiaries, such as SpamCop.net, Inc.  Our privacy statement is effective as of June 30, 2004.   We may update our policy from time to time without notice, so please check back periodically.  All updates will be published at this site.

            </p><h3>Personal Information</h3>
            <p>As the leading email security provider for organizations ranging from small businesses to the Global 2000, IronPort understands your desire to protect personal information.  We intend to inform you of how your personal information will be gathered, tracked or used, and to give you choices.  If choices are not offered on one of our Websites where your personal information is obtained, please select one of the communication channels at the bottom of this statement to indicate your communication preferences.

            </p><h3>What Information We Gather</h3>
            <p>We request personal information when you place an order, register a product, request or register for a service, answer a survey, enter a contest, correspond with us or engage in certain other activities on our Websites.  For example, if you submit an order on-line with us, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction, such as your name, address and payment information.  Or, for example, if you request technical support online, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction, such as your name, address and information about your computer hardware, software and the nature of the problem you are experiencing.  Providing such information is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide such information to IronPort, but you may not get the full benefit of our products and services without providing such information.

            </p><h3>How We Use the Information We Gather and Track</h3>
            <p>You decide whether to continue with any activity that requests personal information.  If you do not wish to provide the requested information, however, you may not be able to complete the activity.
            </p><p>We use personally identifiable information in the following ways:
            </p><ol>
                <li>To provide you with information about product upgrades, new products, services, newsletters, informative emails, and research on future product ideas or improvements;
                </li><li>To assist us in creating content that is relevant to you;
                </li><li>To provide you with special offers that may be of interest to you;
                </li><li>To assist us in creating better products and services to meet your needs;
                </li><li>To allow you to purchase and download products, obtain access to services or otherwise engage in activities you select;
                </li><li>To help you quickly find software, services or product information important to you.
            </li></ol>

            <h3>With Whom We May Share Your Information</h3>
            <p>From time to time, unless we have stated otherwise, we may provide certain information to selected business partners in order to effectively provide the product or service requested.  For example, we share information about the email practices of applicants for our Bonded SenderTM Program with TRUSTe, the leading independent, non-profit entity dedicated to building trust and confidence on the Internet.  In addition, registered users of our SpamCop service may file complaints about unwanted e-mail that are forwarded to Internet abuse desks.  IronPort cannot control what happens to any personally identifying information contained in a complaint once the complaint is sent, but IronPort will not send complaints without your consent.
            </p><p>In addition, IronPort may retain the services of outside contractors to provide services for us.  They may be used to ship products, provide technical support, handle order processing or perform other services for us.  We require that these contractors keep the personal information of customers secure and confidential.  We also require that these contractors use personal information only on behalf of IronPort.
            </p><p>If you prefer that we not provide your information to our business partners, you may let us know by using one of the methods described in this policy.  Please be advised that in certain instances, it may be necessary for IronPort to disclose your personal information to government officials or otherwise as required by our legal obligations.

            </p><h3>Choice/Opt-out</h3>
            <p>IronPort provides a number of ways for you to 'opt-out' of receiving additional information from us or having us provide your personal information to our partners.  We may offer you these choices at the time you give us your information.
            </p><p>If you are on an IronPort Website that requires personal information but does not offer communication choices, or would like to change your preferences for information that you have previously provided, please use one of the communication channels at the bottom of this statement.
            </p><p>If you do not wish to continue receiving any e-mail newsletters or bulletins we may send to you, you can opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to the unsubscribe in the subject line in the email.

            </p><h3>Security and Quality of Personal Information</h3>
            <p>We have taken security measures to protect your personal information, including technical and procedural steps to protect your data from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction.
            </p><p>Since IronPort is a global company, we provide company information to our worldwide offices. The personal information that you have provided to us may be transferred to other IronPort offices around the world.  For example, when European customers register or obtain support for IronPort products, their personal information may be transferred to servers in the United States then transferred to servers in one or more of IronPort's European offices.  Also, in certain countries our outside contractors might undertake the collection, transferring, storage and processing of your information.
            </p><p>We make a sincere effort to respond to your requests to update or correct your personal information.  If you believe that IronPort does not have your current personal information, you can update it by using one of the communication channels at the bottom of this statement.

            </p><h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>IronPort may use cookies from time to time.  A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows us to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in our databases.

            </p><p>IronPort may also use cookies to track your visit to our Websites.  While our Web servers may automatically log your IP address, your Internet traffic statistics will not be tied back to other personal information.

Personal information provided to IronPort will be protected by requirements at least as strict as IronPort's internal policies.  However, IronPort is not responsible for the privacy practices of our business partners.  If you visit their Websites, we encourage you to read their privacy statements, as they may differ from ours.

            </p><h3>Other Privacy Considerations</h3>
            <p>Please remember that information you submit in a discussion group or forum, like the "SpamCop Discussion Forum", will be deemed public information and is not confidential.  There is a risk in such communication venues that information can be collected and used by others.  Please be careful and responsible when you are online.

            </p><h3>Policy Changes</h3>
            <p>In the event there is a major change to IronPort's privacy practices, a prominent notice will be posted on our Websites.  If the change involves the use of your personally identifiable information, the notice will contain instructions on how you can opt-out of such use.
