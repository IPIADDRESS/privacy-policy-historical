<p style="text-align: left;" align="right"><strong>PRIVACY POLICY </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Last updated: August 5, 2015</em></strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and share information when you use our Services. The terms “we,” “us,” or “our” mean SeniorHomes.com, its operating company, parent company and each of their legal subsidiaries and affiliates. The term “Services,” means, collectively, various websites, applications, widgets, email notifications and other mediums, or portions of such mediums, through which you have accessed this Privacy Policy. By accessing or using our Services, you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of Your Information (collectively, “Use of Your Information”) as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Your Information” means information about you, which may be of a confidential nature and may include personally identifying information, medical and health history information, and/or financial information.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to our Use of Your Information as a result of you using our Services, and does not apply to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information collected through mediums other than our Services;</li>
<li>Information collected through our Services where a separate privacy policy applies, such as a sweepstakes entry (you should refer to the official rules and privacy policy for each individual sweepstakes for our specific policies regarding information sharing and disclosure pursuant to sweepstakes entry); or</li>
<li>Information collected by any person or entity other than us, even if related to our Services (such as a third-party website, application, widget or lead form).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this Privacy Policy, our Services are also governed by our <a title="Terms of Use" href="/p/terms/">Terms of Use</a> and any other documents referred to in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. These documents describe information that we collect from you or that you provide on or to the Services and how Your Information may be used and disclosed by us. They also describe the choices available to you regarding our Use of Your Information and how you can access and update Your Information. Please read this Privacy Policy and the <a href="http://www.seniorhomes.com/p/terms/">Terms of Use</a> carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect and Receive About You</strong><br>
We might receive or collect several types of information about you, such as the information described below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information You Provide</span><br>
The following are situations in which you may provide Your Information to us:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you fill out forms or fields through our Services;</li>
<li>When you sign up for any newsletters or other materials, or other products and services through our Services;</li>
<li>When you provide information to us through a third-party application, service or website;</li>
<li>When you communicate with us or request information about us or our Services, whether via email or other means;</li>
<li>When you participate in online surveys;</li>
<li>When you participate in any of our marketing initiatives, including, contests, events, or promotions; and</li>
<li>When you participate in forums or provide user generated content or submissions.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Third Parties Provide</span><br>
We may collect information about you from sources other than you, such as from social media websites (i.e., Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or others), blogs, other users and our business partners.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Use and Preference Information</span><br>
We may collect, receive and store information regarding your general use of our Services (such as details of how and when you used our Services, interactions with our Services, log in information, resources that you access, your Internet protocol address, your browser type, and your device type), as well as your preferences.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Device Information</span><br>
When you use our Services through your computer, mobile phone or other device, we may collect information regarding and related to your device, such as hardware models and IDs, device type, operating system version, the request type, the content of your request and basic usage information about your use of our Services, such as date and time. In addition, we may collect information regarding application-level events and associate that with your account to provide customer service. We may also collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage and application data caches.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Location Information</span><br>
If you enable the collection of location information on your device, then we may collect information about your actual location, such as your mobile device’s GPS coordinates. We may also use other technologies to determine your location (such as through the location of nearby Wi-Fi access points or cell towers), or obtain your location information from third parties.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phone Numbers</span><br>
We may collect your phone number in several ways. For example, we may collect your phone number: (i) if you submit your phone number to us through our Services; (ii) by capturing your phone number if you call us; or (iii) if a third party provides your phone number to us.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-Personally Identifiable Information</span><br>
We may collect demographic information about you such as gender, zip code, and birth date, and information regarding your preferences and usage. This type of information is not, by itself, personally identifiable information. However, if we link such information with personally identifiable information in a manner that identifies a particular individual, then we will treat all such information as personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Log Files, Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers</span><br>
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality, and to document your consent to receiving products, services or communications from us or our partners. If we link such information with personally identifiable information in a manner that identifies a particular individual, then we will treat all such information as personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by us and our partners, affiliates, advertisers, analytics teams, or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.<br>
We use cookies to help us know that you are logged on, provide you with features based on your preferences, understand when you are interacting with our Services, and compile other information regarding use of our Services. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use cookies to collect and store information. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.</p>
<p>We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 Storage to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML5 Storage to collect and store information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Network Advertising</span><br>
From time to time, we may participate in, partner with, or use advertising networks, such as third-party advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and research firms. For example, we use Google AdSense to publish ads on our Services.&nbsp; When you view or click on an ad, a cookie will be set to help better provide advertisements that may be of interest to you on this and other Web sites. In addition, we may use third-party advertising networks to serve advertisements to you on our Web site, or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. This practice is often referred to as “online behavioral advertising.” Please see the “Online Behavioral Advertising” subsection of <a title="Choices About How We Use and Collect Your Information" href="http://www.bankrate.com/coinfo/privacy.asp#behavior">Choices About How We Use and Collect Your Information</a> below to read about how you can prevent certain third-party advertising networks from collecting information about you.</p>
<p><strong>How we Secure Your Information</strong></p>
<p>Our web servers support the TLS and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) transport and encryption protocols. The purpose of these protocols is to keep the information passed back and forth between a web server and its users confidential. In addition, we use cipher suites that offer at minimum 112 bit encryption. We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the site’s servers from unauthorized access using industry standard computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully developed security procedures and practices. In addition, a username, member ID name and password are required for you to use, view or change application or interview information. We use both internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Information</strong><br>
We may make Use of Your Information for various lawful business purposes. Among others, these purposes may include using Your Information to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Engage in customer support</span>. For example, we might confirm and complete transactions requested by you, verify information you provide to us and provide you with administrative notices.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contact you and provide you with information</span>. For example, we might provide or contact you through telephone, email, postal or other communications with Service updates, promotional materials, surveys, offers, quotes, personalized information and other information from us or our business partners.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Analyze, improve and manage our Services and operations</span>. For example, we might obtain feedback regarding our Services, understand and anticipate your needs and preferences, better understand your use of our Services, customize and tailor Service content and advertising, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, engage in statistical analysis and provide feedback to our vendors, advertisers and other third parties.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Resolve problems and disputes, and engage in other legal and security matters</span>. For example, we may use Your Information to comply with, monitor compliance with and enforce this Privacy Policy, our <a title="Terms of Use" href="/p/terms/">Terms of Use</a> and any other applicable agreements and policies, meet other legal and regulatory requirements, and to protect the security and integrity of our Services and your information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How We Disclose Information</strong><br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Disclosure of Your Information</span><br>
We will share your personally identifiable information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>We may disclose Your Information:</p>
<ul>
<li>To any person who, in our reasonable judgment, is authorized to receive Your Information as your agent, including as a result of your business dealings with that person (for example, your attorney);</li>
<li>To our third-party vendors so that they may provide support for our internal and business operations, including for the handling of data processing, data verification, data storage, surveys, research, internal marketing, delivery of promotional, marketing and transaction materials, and our Services’ maintenance and security. These companies are authorized to Use Your Information only as necessary to provide these services to us and are contractually obligated to keep Your Information confidential;</li>
<li>To third parties when you use our Services to obtain a quote, services, or information from one or more of those third parties (e.g. a senior living community in connection with your completion of an information request form) (”Service Providers”), such as by clicking “Find Costs Information” or other similar buttons at the end of a form, and we may be compensated in connection with such disclosure;</li>
<li>To third parties when you engage in certain activities through our Services that are sponsored by them, such as purchasing products or services offered by a third party, electing to receive information or communications from a third party, or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored, in whole or in part, by a third party. When we disclose Your Information to these third parties, we may be compensated, and Your Information will become subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of Your Information;</li>
<li>To third parties that are interested in contacting you or providing offers to you that may be related to our Services or about products or services you may find of interest, and we may be compensated for such disclosure;</li>
<li>As required by law or ordered by a court, regulatory, or administrative agency;</li>
<li>As we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, if we believe that you are violating any applicable law, rule or regulation, or are otherwise interfering with another’s rights or property, including, without limitation, our rights or property;</li>
<li>If requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or instance of local, regional or national emergency;</li>
<li>To enforce our <a title="Terms of Use" href="/p/terms/">Terms of Use</a><a href="http://www.bankrate.com/coinfo/disclaimer.asp">,</a> this Privacy Policy, and any other applicable agreements and policies;</li>
<li>To enforce or protect our rights;</li>
<li>In connection with a Business Transfer, as defined below (see <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Transfers</span> below); and</li>
<li>To our affiliated companies (i.e., companies under common control or management with us).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you do not want Your Information shared as described above, then you should not provide us with Your Information. </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requests for Quotes, Information and Services from Service Providers</span><br>
As noted above, we may share Your Information with Service Providers when you use our Services to obtain or request a quote, services or information from one or more third parties (an “Inquiry”). The Service Providers we may share Your Information with may be determined subsequent to your Inquiry (e.g. after you talk to a family advisor or by an automated matching algorithm). <strong>IF YOU SUBMIT AN INQUIRY, SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY VIA MAIL, TELEPHONE, TEXT MESSAGE, FAX, EMAIL AND OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION. IN ORDER TO ASSIST YOU IN FINDING SENIOR CARE, YOU MAY RECEIVE CALLS FROM OUR FAMILY ADVISORS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING AN INQUIRY THROUGH OUR SERVICES,EVEN IF YOU ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY OR ANY OTHER DO NOT CALL REGISTRY. THE FCC MAY VIEW THESE CALLS AS TELEMARKETING CALLS.</strong></p>
<p>If you are matched with Service Providers, you expressly consent to the Service Providers conducting any research necessary to provide you with information related to your Inquiry. Service Providers may need to share Your Information to conduct such research. <strong>If you do not want Service Providers to conduct necessary research to provide you with information for your Inquiry, then you should not submit an Inquiry.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please note that if you submit an Inquiry through our Services and we share Your Information as described above in connection with your Inquiry, you will not have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of Your Information in connection with that Request.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aggregation and De-Personalization</span><br>
We may take Your Information and de-identify it either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating Your Information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-identifying Your Information). We reserve the right to share, loan, rent, sell, or otherwise disclose such information to third parties at any time, for any lawful purpose, without notice or compensation to you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sharing with Friends</span><br>
If the Services contains any functionality allowing you to send content to a friend, then please be aware that: (a) we may display your email address to your friend; and (b) we may use information you provide about your friend to facilitate the communication and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We do not store your friends email address in our database. Your friend will receive a one-time message notifying them of the shared content.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sweepstakes </span><br>
If you are submitting information to us pursuant to a sweepstakes entry, we reserve the right to share, loan, rent, sell or otherwise disclose the information that you submit with third parties at any time, for any lawful purpose without notice or compensation to you. Participation in these sweepstakes is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose Your Information. Please refer to the official rules and privacy policy for each individual sweepstakes for our specific policies regarding information sharing and disclosure pursuant to that sweepstakes entry.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Circumvention of Security Measures</span><br>
No method of transmission or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. Additionally, by way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose Your Information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary within this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use or any other applicable agreement or policy, you use our Services at your own risk and we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that Your Information will always remain private. In the event that an unauthorized third party compromises our security measures, we will not be responsible for any damages directly or indirectly caused by an unauthorized third party’s ability to view, use or disseminate Your information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Transfers</span><br>
We specifically and expressly reserve the right to disclose, lease, sell, assign or transfer Your Information collected through our Services, and any of our databases, together with any personally identifiable information contained in such databases, to third parties in connection with a Business Transfer. A “Business Transfer” means a share or asset sale, acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, spin-off, bankruptcy or other corporate change involving us and/or our affiliates, even if the Business Transfer is only being contemplated and regardless of whether the Business Transfer relates to a part or a whole of our business. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our business, equity, and/or assets (including our Services) to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any lawful purpose, without compensation to you.</p>
