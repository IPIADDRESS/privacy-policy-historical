          <small>Version 2.0.0 of This Agreement was created on May  1, 2018.</small>
        </p>
<p>At Sentry, we provide real-time error tracking for your web apps, mobile apps
and games, which gives developers the insight needed to reproduce and fix
crashes.</p>

<p>Sentry is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy
Policy (this “Policy”) sets out how we collect and process personal information
about you when you visit our website sentry.io, when you use our products and
services (our “Services”), or when you otherwise do business or make contact
with us.</p>

<p>Please read this policy carefully to understand how we handle and treat your
personal information.</p>

<a id="what-information-do-we-collect" class="anchor" href="#what-information-do-we-collect" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What information do we collect?</h2>

<p>Sentry collects data to enable us to operate the Services effectively, and to
provide you with the best experiences on our website and our Services. You
provide some of this data to us directly, such as when you register to use our
Services, subscribe to a newsletter, respond to a survey, make an enquiry
through our website, contact us for support, or contact us as a prospective
customer, vendor, supplier, or consultant. We get some of your data by
recording how you interact with our website and our Services by, for example,
using technologies like cookies. We also obtain and process data in the context
of providing the Services.</p>

<details>
<summary>Learn more</summary><p>You have choices about the data we collect. When you are asked to provide
personal data, you may decline. But if you choose not to provide data that is
necessary to enable us to provide the Services, you may not be able to use all
or part of those Services.</p>

<p>The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Sentry,
the choices you make (including your privacy settings), and the Services you
use. The data we collect can include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Name and contact information</strong>. We may collect your first and last name,
email address, password, postal address, phone number, company information, and
other similar contact data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Payment information</strong>. When you make purchases
on our website, a secure window will be opened directly to our payment provider
(currently, Stripe), and any payment information that you provide is sent
directly to the payment provider. We have no access to that information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Customer information</strong>. When you subscribe to our Services from your website,
game, or app, you will control what event data is collected and stored on our
systems. For example, you might ask Sentry to log basic user data (e.g., email
address or username), device identifiers, IP addresses, event type, and related
source code. In such cases, we act as a data processor, in accordance with your
instructions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Device and Usage information</strong>. We may collect data about your device and
how you and your device interact with Sentry and our Services. For example, we
may collect:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><em>Use data</em>. We may collect data about the features you use, the Services
you purchase, and the web pages you visit. This also includes your
interactions on our website, and your interactions with us via email.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Device, connectivity and configuration data</em>. We may collect data about
your device and the network you use to connect to our Services. This may
include data about the operating system and other software installed on
your device, including product keys. It may also include IP address, browser
type, operating system, and referring URLs.</p>

<a id="how-do-we-protect-your-information" class="anchor" href="#how-do-we-protect-your-information" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do we protect your information?</h2>

<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your
personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal
information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit
information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then
encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by
those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required
to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private
information (e.g., credit cards, social security numbers, financials) will not
be stored on our servers. For more information, please review our
<a href="/security/">Security &amp; Compliance Policy</a>.</p>

<p>We implement a variety of measures to ensure that our processing systems remain
confidential, resilient, and available. Specifically, we have implemented
processes to help ensure high availability, business continuity, and prompt
disaster recovery. We commit to maintaining strong physical and logical access
controls, and conduct regular penetration testing to identify and address
potential vulnerabilities.</p>

<details>
<summary>Learn more</summary><p><strong>High Availability</strong>. Every part of the Services utilize properly-provisioned,
redundant servers (e.g., multiple load balancers, web servers, replica
databases) in case of failure. We take servers out of operation as part of
regular maintenance, without impacting availability.</p>

<p><strong>Business Continuity</strong>. We keep encrypted backups of data every hour in
multiple regions on Google Cloud Platform. While never expected, in the case of
production data loss (i.e., primary data stores loss), we will restore
organizational data from these backups.</p>

<p><strong>Disaster Recovery</strong>. In the event of a region-wide outage, we will bring up a
duplicate environment in a different Google Cloud Platform region. Our
operations team has extensive experience performing full region migrations.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Access Controls</strong>. Sentry is hosted on Google Cloud Platform. Google
data centers feature a layered security model, including extensive safeguards
such as custom-designed electronic access cards, alarms, vehicle access
barriers, perimeter fencing, metal detectors, and biometrics. According to the
Google Security Whitepaper: “The data center floor features laser beam
intrusion detection. Data centers are monitored 24/7 by high-resolution
interior and exterior cameras that can detect and track intruders. Access logs,
activity records, and camera footage are reviewed in case an incident occurs.
Data centers are also routinely patrolled by professional security guards who
have undergone rigorous background checks and training.” Sentry employees do
not have physical access to Google data centers, servers, network equipment, or
storage.</p>

<p><strong>Logical Access Controls</strong>. Sentry is the assigned administrator of its
infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform, and only designated authorized Sentry
operations team members have access to configure the infrastructure on an
as-needed basis behind a two-factor authenticated virtual private network.
Specific private keys are required for individual servers, and keys are stored
in a secure and encrypted location.</p>

<p><strong>Penetration Testing</strong>. We engage an independent, third-party agency to
perform black box penetration testing on an annual basis. Information about
security vulnerabilities that are successfully exploited through penetration
testing is then used to set mitigation and remediation priorities. If you are a
customer on one of our “Enterprise” plans, we will provide a summary of
penetration test findings to you upon request.</p>

<p><strong>Intrusion Detection and Prevention</strong>. Unusual network patterns or suspicious
behavior are among Sentry’s biggest concerns for infrastructure hosting and
management. Google Cloud Platform’s intrusion detection and prevention systems
(IDS/IPS) rely on both signature-based and algorithm-based security to help
identify traffic patterns that are similar to known attack methods. IDS/IPS
involves tightly controlling the size and make-up of the attack surface,
employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points, and developing
and deploying technologies that automatically remedy dangerous situations, as
well as preventing known threats from accessing the system in the first place.
We do not provide direct access to security event forensics, but we do provide
access to our engineering and customer support teams during and after any
unscheduled downtime.</p>

the purposes outlined in the policy. You can ask to close your account by
contacting us at the details above, and we will delete your personal

Services to you, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our
legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because
these needs can vary for different types of data in the context of the
different Services we provide, actual retention periods can vary significantly.
The criteria we use to determine the retention periods include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>How long is the personal data needed to provide the Services and/or operate
our business?</em> This includes such things such as maintaining and improving the
performance of the Services, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining
appropriate business and financial records. This is the general rule that
establishes the baseline for most data retention periods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Is there an automated control, such as in your privacy dashboard, that
enables you to access and delete the personal data at any time?</em> If there is
not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Is the personal data of a sensitive type?</em> If so, a shortened retention time
would generally be appropriate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period?</em> If so, we will
retain the data in accordance with your consent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Is Sentry subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain
the data?</em> Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable
jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation,
or data that must be retained for the purposes of litigation.</p>
