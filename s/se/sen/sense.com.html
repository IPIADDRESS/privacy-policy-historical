            <p>Sense was built from the ground up with the privacy of your
                data in mind. Keeping your data secure, and in your control, is central
                to how we run our company and how we build and sell our product. Most
                importantly, we believe that your data belongs to you, and that it is
                confidential. We use best-in-class practices and technology to keep it
                private and secure. We will not share it with others unless you have
                given us permission to do so, or we have anonymized and / or aggregated it such
                that your information is not personally identifiable.</p>

            <p>Our Privacy Policy lays out what data we collect, how we use
                it, and what your rights are. If you have any questions, please let us
                know at <a href="mailto:privacy@sense.com">privacy@sense.com</a>.</p>

            <p>Terms not defined herein are defined in the Sense Terms &amp; Conditions (<a href="https://sense.com/legal">https://sense.com/legal</a>).</p>

            <h2>Information Collected</h2>

            <p><b>Product Data.</b> The Sense monitor collects detailed
                data about the usage of electricity through the electrical panel in which it is
                installed. It collects detailed wattage and voltage information, and uses
                this data to generate hypotheses about specific devices in use. A subset
                of this data is sent to our servers, where it is stored indefinitely.</p>

            <p><b>Service Data.</b> The Sense Application collects
                various information at setup time, and in the course of usage. We collect
                location data to set your time zone and to enhance product operations (for
                example, to correlate to weather), we track application usage information to
                monitor customer experience, and we collect crash and error information for
                improving application experience.</p>

            <p><b>Information for Purchase.</b> We collect
                information about the purchase and delivery of Sense. This includes your
                email address, billing and shipping address, and (optionally) your phone
                number. Credit card information is not collected by Sense and is
                processed by a third party.</p>

            <p><b>General Website Data.</b> We collect information
                about you in various ways when you use the Site. We collect personal
                information you provide to us. For example, we collect your name, email
                address, and other information you provide via the Site when you submit
                inquiries or request more information about our Product and Service.</p>

                language, and the website you visited before our site are logged automatically.
                We also collect information about your usage and activity of the Site.</p>

            <p><b>Cookies</b>. We may automatically collect

                Web beacons. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used via the Service
                or in our emails. We use Web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits,
