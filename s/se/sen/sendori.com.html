In order to use this Web site, you must first complete the application form 
and create an account by providing an email and password.  In addition, a security 
question and answer is collected for password recovery. Within the application you are 
required to give contact information such as name and email address. We use this 
information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.  
<br><br>
If approved, you must provide your full address and financial information such as PayPal
or bank account information. The address and financial information is used to make and
receive payments - i.e. we use Paypal to facilitate our order/payment processing.
When you place an order you will be automatically transferred to Paypal's site.
Please be aware that their privacy policy governs the use and collection of the information and is shared back with us to fulfill the order.
PayPal is not currently integrated into the Sendori website, so all payments are
handled manually.  That is, we collect a PayPal address from our users, and use that address to
send payments through the PayPal website.  We also provide an email address which can
be used to send payments to Sendori through PayPal.
<br><br>
The Sendori Service is run using a hosting service. In addition,
third-party domain parking companies are used to monetize Web visitors, 
not monetized by the Sendori Service. Sendori does not provide any personally
