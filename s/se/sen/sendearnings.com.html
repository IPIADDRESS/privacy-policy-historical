			<h2>III. CO-REGISTRATION</h2>
					<div class="clearfix"></div>
			<ol class="privacy-groopt-ol">
				<li>
					<h4>Definition</h4>
					<p>
						SendEarnings® signup pages may contain co-registration checkboxes, where Users can choose to 
						“co-register” for other websites, tools, or services during their registration with 
						SendEarnings® by checking the checkbox next to the co-registration Offer. Users are not required 
						to select any co-registration boxes to join SendEarnings®; however, they may be required to do so 
						in order to qualify for Signup Bonus(es) and/or other promotions.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Information Sharing</h4>
					<p>
						When a User co-registers for an Offer by checking the co-registration checkbox, any information they 
						provide to SendEarnings® may be shared with the Advertiser associated with the co-registration 
						Offer. SendEarnings® cannot control what Advertisers subsequently do with that information.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Privacy on Other Sites and Within Third Party Frames</h4>
					<p>
						The Service Platform may contain links to third party websites, services, or tools. Similarly, the 
						Service Platform may contain framed / webview content from a third party. We provide these links and 
						framed / webview content for your convenience. We do not review, control or monitor the privacy 
						practices of websites, services or tools operated by others. We are not responsible for the performance 
						of these sites, services or tools or for your business dealings with them. Your use of other websites, 
						services, or third party tools is subject to the terms and conditions of those third party items, 
						including the privacy policies of those websites, services, and/or/ third party tools.
					</p>
									</li>

				<p>in short:</p>
				<div class="pullbig">Our Advertisers each have their own Privacy Policies.</div>
			</div>

					</div>
				<div class="groopt mainlevel">
			<h2>IV. COOKIES AND THIRD PARTY TRACKING TECHNOLOGY</h2>
					<div class="clearfix"></div>
			<ol class="privacy-groopt-ol">
				<li>
					<h4>About Cookies and Third Party Technology.</h4>  
					<p>
						A “cookie” is a small data file that may be saved to and stored on your computer when you visit 
						a website or similar technology or open an email. Cookies permit a website or similar technology operator to 
						“remember” whether your computer has visited the website, tool or service before and helps the 
						operator create a more personalized experience for you and records activities taken by you, such as offers 
						completed. (In all cases in this Privacy Policy, the word “computer” includes all forms and styles 
						of computing technologies including but not limited to desktop computers, laptop computers, tablet devices, 
						smart-phones, other mobile or wearable computing technology.)
					</p>  
					<p>
						In addition to cookie technology, SendEarnings® and our Advertisers use additional third party 
						technology and tracking tools to record offers and activities completed by you, friends referred by you, 
						and to communicate information about you, such as demographic information (e.g., age, gender), in order 
						to target offers and advertisements to specific groups as requested by Advertisers. These items are 
						referred to as “Cookies and Recording Tools” as further described elsewhere in this 
						Privacy Policy.
					</p>
					<p>
						Your computer, tablet, smart-phone or similar device should permit you to change the settings on your 
						web browser to not accept and/or disable Cookies and Recording Tools. However, if you do not accept 
						Cookies and Recording Tools used by SendEarnings® and our Advertisers, you may not be able to 
						use certain functions on certain websites, services or tools. More importantly, if you do not accept 
						Cookies and Recording Tools you will not receive credit for offers or other actions completed by you 
						because we and our Advertisers are unable to track and record your activity. If you do not want to 
						accept Cookies and Recording Tools, you must stop using the Service Platform.
					</p>  
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Third Party Cookies</h4>
					<p>
						Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, we or a data provider we have engaged may place or 
						recognize a unique Cookie and/or Recording Tool on your browser or elsewhere on your computing device 
						to enable you to receive customized ads or content. These Cookies and Recording Tools contain no 
						personally identifiable information. The Cookies and Recording Tools may reflect de-identified 
						demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, 
						that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of these 
						Cookies and Recording Tools, please go to 
						<a class="aboutads" target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Referral and Affiliate Tracking</h4>
					<p>
						SendEarnings® uses Cookies and Recording Tools in order to track new User registrations. This 
						ensures Users are properly credited for referring other Users, as well as to track earnings for our 
						Affiliates.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>User Recognition</h4>
					<p>
						After a User has logged into the SendEarnings® Member’s Section, Cookies and Recording 
						Tools are used to remember their Username and Password so they do not need to be entered during every 
						visit to the Service Platform. Users can logout of the Member’s Section if they do not wish to have 
						this information saved.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Location (Geo) Tracking</h4>
					<p>
						From time to time, SendEarnings® may permit Members to participate in activities, or provide 
						offers, that involve use of location tracking / geo-tracking technology, that will share the physical 
						location of a Member’s computer or mobile device. For example, we may contract with a market 
						research firm that would track a Member’s physical location through geo-tracking / mobile technology 
						for market research purposes. A Member may choose to opt-out or opt-in to this experience and offer. 
						If the individual opts-in, the Member agrees to permit location-tracking, and also may be required to 
						agree to the terms of service of such third party.  If a Member opts-in to location (geo) tracking, 
						SendEarnings® may then share such information with any/all the third parties with whom it does 
						business that request such information.
