SendEarnings reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. The date and time of the last update will always appear below, which serves as notice to our Users.
<br><br>Last Updated: <em>September 05, 2005 6:33 p.m. CST</em>


<br><br><br><strong>I.    INFORMATION COLLECTION</strong>

<br><br>1. <strong>Information Collected</strong>
<br><br>All Users must provide the following information in order to join SendEarnings: name, mailing address, phone number, email address, username, and password. Users may be required to provide subsequent demographic information in order to receive Signup Bonus(es) and/or qualify for other promotions. Demographic information includes, but is not limited to: birth date, gender, marital status, education completed, household income, and number of children in household.
<br><br>2. <strong>Means of Collection</strong>
<br><br>Currently, the only way to join SendEarnings is through one of our signup forms. We do not acquire Users through purchase, co-registration, or any other means; however, we may do so at any time in the future.


<br><br><br><strong>II.    USE OF INFORMATION</strong>

<br><br>1. <strong>Use of Information</strong>
<br><br>User information is used by SendEarnings in all of the following, but not limited to, ways:
	<br><br><strong>(a)</strong> E-Mail Address is used to send paid email advertisements and important announcements about SendEarnings to User
	<br><strong>(b)</strong> Mailing Address is used to send payments earned by User
	<br><strong>(c)</strong> Demographic information is used to target advertisements to User
	<br><strong>(d)</strong> Username and Password are used for User protection to restrict access to their account
<br><br>2. <strong>Sharing of Information</strong>
<br><br>SendEarnings does not rent, sell, or share User information, except in the following circumstances:
	<br><br><strong>(a)</strong> We are required to release User information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes
	<br><strong>(b)</strong> We are sold to or acquired by another company, in which case all User information would then belong to said company
	<br><strong>(c)</strong> We share User information when co-registration boxes (explained below) are checked during the course of registration
	<br><strong>(d)</strong> We suspect a User of committing fraud, in which case User information may be shared during the course of our investigation
	<br><strong>(e)</strong> We provide User information to trusted partners in order to enhance the service provided to our Users


<br><br><br><strong>III.    CO-REGISTRATION</strong>

<br><br>1. <strong>Definition</strong>
<br><br>SendEarnings signup pages may contain co-registration checkboxes, where Users can choose to "co-register" for other Web Sites during their registration with SendEarnings by checking the checkbox next to the co-registration Offer. Users are not required to select any co-registration boxes to join SendEarnings; however, they may be required to do so in order to qualify for Signup Bonus(es) and/or other promotions.
<br><br>2. <strong>Information Sharing</strong>
<br><br>When a User co-registers for an Offer by checking the co-registration checkbox, any information they provide to SendEarnings may be shared with the Advertiser associated with the co-registration Offer. SendEarnings cannot control what Advertisers subsequently do with that information.


<br><br><br><strong>IV.    COOKIES</strong>

<br><br>1. <strong>Referral and Affiliate Tracking</strong>
<br><br>SendEarnings uses cookies in order to track new User registrations. This ensures Users are properly credited for referring other Users, as well as to track earnings for our Affiliates.
<br><br>2. <strong>User Recognition</strong>
<br><br>After a User has logged into the SendEarnings Member's Section, cookies are used to remember their Username and Password so they do not need to be entered during every visit to our Web Site. Users can logout of the Member's Section if they do not wish to have this information saved.
<br><br>3. <strong>Cookies are Safe!</strong>
<br><br>Cookies used by SendEarnings can only be seen by SendEarnings, and cannot in any way cause harm to your computer. Because we cannot properly track user actions without the use of Cookies (to ensure Users are credited for completing Offers, referring friends, etc), our Web Site will not function properly for Users who have Cookies disabled.
