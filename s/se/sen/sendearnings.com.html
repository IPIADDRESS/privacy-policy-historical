			<h2>CO-REGISTRATION</h2>
			<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
				<li>
					<h3>Definition</h3>
					<p>
						SendEarnings signup pages may contain co-registration checkboxes, where Users
							can choose to “co-register” for other Web Sites during their registration with SendEarnings
							by checking the checkbox next to the co-registration Offer. Users are not required to select any
							co-registration boxes to join SendEarnings; however, they may be required to do so in order to
							qualify for Signup Bonus(es) and/or other promotions.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Information Sharing</h3>
					<p>
						When a User co-registers for an Offer by checking the co-registration checkbox,
							any information they provide to SendEarnings may be shared with the Advertiser associated with
							the co-registration Offer. SendEarnings cannot control what Advertisers subsequently do with that
							information.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Privacy on Other Sites</h3>
					<p>
						This website may contain links to third party websites. We provide these links
							for your convenience, but we do not review, control or monitor the privacy practices of websites
							operated by others. We are not responsible for the performance of these sites or for your business
							dealings with them. Your use of other websites is subject to the terms and conditions of those
							websites, including the privacy policies of those websites.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>COOKIES</h2>
			<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
				<li>
					<h3>Referral and Affiliate Tracking</h3>
					<p>
						SendEarnings uses cookies in order to track new User registrations. This ensures
							Users are properly credited for referring other Users, as well as to track earnings for our Affiliates.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>User Recognition</h3>
					<p>
						After a User has logged into the SendEarnings Member’s Section, cookies are used to remember
						their Username and Password so they do not need to be entered during every visit to our Web Site.
						Users can logout of the Member’s Section if they do not wish to have this information saved.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Cookies</h3>
					<p>
						Cookies used by SendEarnings can only be seen by SendEarnings. Because we cannot
							properly track user actions without the use of Cookies (to ensure Users are credited for completing
							Offers, referring friends, etc), our Web Site will not function properly for Users who have Cookies
							disabled.
					</p>
					<p>
						We also use cookies to track non-personal information such as date and time the
							website is visited and number of pages viewed. Because non-personal information does not identify
							the identity of any specific User we may use or disclose non-personal information in any way and
							with any third party.
