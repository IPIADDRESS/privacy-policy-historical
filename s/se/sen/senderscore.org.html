<h1>Return Path Privacy Statement</h1>
<p>Effective: October  15, 2006</p>
<p>Protecting your privacy is very important to Return Path. We know that you're concerned with privacy on the Internet, and we've taken many steps to help safeguard your information.</p>
<p>This privacy statement is provided to inform you of our privacy policy and practices and of the choices you can make about the way your personal information is collected online and how that information is used. By personal information we mean information about you collected through this Web site, including your email address, or any other information.</p>
<h4><a name="1"></a>The organization collecting information at this Web site</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.returnpath.com" title="Go to the Return Path Web site">Return Path</a> ("Company" or "we"), operates the website located at <a href="/">senderscore.org</a> (the "Site"). Through the Site, Company operates the Sender Score Reputation Data Lookup  Service (the "Service"), by which it allows users who register with us to receive feedback messages from participating Internet Service Providers. Return Path provides this service on behalf of select Internet Service Providers partnered with Return Path.</p>
<h4><a name="2"></a>The information we collect</h4>
<p><em>Collection and Use</em><br>
To simply view the Site without registering for the, you will not be required to provide any personal information. &nbsp;If you elect to sign-up for the Service, you will be registering with Return Path on the form provided and such registration may require you to provide personally identifiable information such as your name and email address.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you provide us with your email address or other personal information, or if we obtain such information about you from you or from one of our marketing partners, we will retain and use that information solely for the purpose of sending email regarding information and changes to our products and services that affect our partners and users, to ensure continuing operation of our web site. We also reserve the right to send these messages whenever an important update to our existing products and services or a new product, feature or functionality becomes available. When necessary, we may also use your personal information to ensure compliance with Company policies and applicable law.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>With whom it may be shared</h4>
<p>Except for the limited situations discussed in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personal information with third parties. </p>
<p>As the Company develops, we may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that Company or all of its assets are acquired, customer information, including any visitor information collected through the Site or the Service, would be one of the transferred assets. In the event of corporate change, users will be notified in accordance with the “Changes to these terms” section of the policy if their personal information is provided to the new corporate entity as a result of corporate ownership change.</p>
<p>Finally, Company reserves the right to disclose list member information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Company’s rights or property, other visitors, list members, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Company also reserves the right to disclose visitor or list member information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>
<h4>Aggregate information</h4>
<p>From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Site and the Service, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. We collect this information through the use of technologies such as “cookies” and “IP addresses”, which are discussed in greater detail below. We may also group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Site and Service to our existing or potential business partners or other third parties, or in response to a government request. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you, other list members or any other visitors to the Site.</p>
<p><em>IP Addresses</em><br>
  An IP address is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer whenever you’re surfing the web. Web servers, the computers that “serve” web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. Company collects IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to third parties and to track the use of the Site. When visitors request pages from the Site or click on a link in a mailing sent through the Service our servers log the visitors’ IP addresses. We reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor or list member when it will enhance the users experience or if we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Site’s policies or to protect Company, the Site, its visitors, the Service, our Internet Service Provider partners, the list members or others.</p>
<p><em>Cookies</em><br>
  Cookies are pieces of information that a websites transfers to an individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you’re at the Site. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you’ll find them at most websites. We use cookies on the subscription review site to verify the subscriber’s login status. They are not used to store personal information, nor to retain historical or transactional subscriber data. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Information such as the total number of visitors and pages viewed is most easily tracked with cookies. We may use the information from cookies to make improvements and updates to the Site and to tailor our services to our visitors’, list members’ and survey participants’ needs.</p>
<p>You always have the option of disabling cookies using your browser preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, please be aware that some features of the Site will not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies.</p>
<h4>Links to other sites</h4>
<p>Please be aware that when you are on the Site, or when you receive an email message from us through the Service, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There may be links to other sites from the Site’s pages or from the email message we send to you that take you outside our Site. These other sites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data or solicit personal information. The privacy policies of these other sites may be significantly different from this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your personal information collected there. Note that when you link to a third party site from the Site, you may see pre-populated data fields with your personal information; however, that information is not available to the third party unless you take certain actions on the third party’s site, such as submitting a form</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a>Firewalls</h4>
<p>Protecting the security of your personal information is very important to us. When we store information that you have provided to us when registering for the Service, that information is protected by security measures that include “firewalls” (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information within our computer network), “intrusion detection systems” (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps detect any unauthorized visitors) and other tools such as data encryption and physical security, where appropriate. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data repository can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Company strives to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personal information.</p>

If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide any personal information to us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.</p>
<h4>Changes to these terms</h4>
<p>The terms of this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes to this Privacy Policy by posting a notice on the homepage of the Site for a reasonable period of time after such changes are made, that this Privacy Policy has been updated, and by changing the “Effective” date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Site and participation in the following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.</p>
