<p align="center"><strong>California  Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></p>
<p>CalOPPA  is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online  services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond  California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably  the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable  information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on  its website stating exactly the information being collected and those  individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See  more at:&nbsp;<a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" target="_blank">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a><br>
  <br>
  <strong>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</strong><br>
  Users  can visit our site anonymously<br>
  Once  this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or  as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.<br>
  Our  Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on  the page specified above.<br>
  <br>
  Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>•</strong>&nbsp;On  our Privacy Policy Page<br>
  Users  are able to change their personal information:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>•</strong>&nbsp;By  logging in to their account<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How does our site handle do not track signals?</strong><br>
  We  honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising  when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</strong><br>
  It's  also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking</p>
<p><strong>COPPA  (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from  children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts  parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer  protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of  websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety  online.<br>
  We  do not specifically market to children under 13. </p>
<p><strong>What type of information is collected from the  students?</strong><br>
1) First Name<br>
2) Last Name<br>
3) Email (optional)</p>
<p>According to COPPA regulation, schools are  allowed to provide consent on behalf of the student parent. The school may  consider providing parents with a notice of Sense-lang online service personal  information collection.</p>
<p><strong>How does Sense-lang use this personal information?</strong><br>
  The student personal information is  essential to support internal operations and account personalization solely  for&nbsp;the use and benefit of the school, and for no other commercial  purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Does Sense-lang use or share personal information for  commercial purposes not related to the provision of the online services  requested by the school?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>
  No. The students personal information is  stored solely for the use and benefit of the school.</p>
<p><strong>Does Sense-lang enable the school to review and delete  the personal information collected from their students?</strong><br>
  Yes. The teacher management tools allow  the school to review, modify or delete the collected personal information.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>What measures does Sense-lang take to protect the  security, confidentiality, and integrity of the collected personal  information?&nbsp;</strong><br>
  We follow accepted industry standards to  protect any provided personal information. Each student (and teacher) account  has personalized credentials (unique username and password chosen by the school  or student). The teacher account holds the credentials of all students'  accounts.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>What are Sense-lang data retention and deletion  policies for children’s personal information?</strong></p>
Student accounts can be  removed only by the teacher. From time to time, Sense-lang reserves the right  to remove teacher accounts (along with student accounts) with no activity for  at least 6 months.
