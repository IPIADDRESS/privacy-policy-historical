<p class="1">Web Site Use Information</p>
<p class="content" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0cm;">Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a  standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below,  "What Are Cookies?") and Web server logs to collect information about  how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server  logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at  our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web  site.&nbsp; We, our advertisers and ad  serving companies may also use small technology or pieces of code to determine  which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to  them.</p>
<p class="MsoTitle" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to  Us?</span></p>
<p class="content" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0cm;">Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of  administering and expanding our business activities, providing customer service  and making available other products and services to our customers and  prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect  to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services and special  offers we think you will find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do  not wish to receive these offers by emailing us at senselang.support@gmail.com.</p>

<p class="content" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0cm;">A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes  an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer  asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard  drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own  cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect  your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has  already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.&nbsp; Some of our business partners (e.g.,  advertisers) use cookies that originate from their sites. We have no access or  control over those cookies.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sub" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0cm;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.0pt; ">How Do We Use Information We Collect from  Cookies?</span></p>
<p class="content" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0cm;">As you use our Web site, the site uses its cookies to  differentiate you from other users.

Cookies, in conjunction with our Web  server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people  visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps  us gather feedback in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve  our customers. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about  you and we do not generally store any personal information that you provided to  us in your cookies.</p>
