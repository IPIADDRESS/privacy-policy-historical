<p class="copy"><b>Information collected if you only browse this site.</b></p>

<p>If you do nothing during your visit to our web site but browse, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit. This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:

</p><ol>
<li>The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used. The Internet Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you.  This address can be translated to determine the domain name of your service provider (e.g. xcompany.com or yourschool.edu). Generally, the City only determines visitor domain names if a security issue is suspected;
</li><li>The type of browser and operating system you used; 
</li><li>The date and time you visited this site;

<p>Information is collected for statistical purposes and to help the City manage the site. The City's web site uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.<br>
<br>
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, the City's web site employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations and the security purposes mentioned elsewhere in this notice, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with public records retention schedules.</p>

<p>The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us.</p>

<p>We use your e-mail address to respond to you. It is the City's Policy to not use your e-mail address to send you unsolicited e-mail unless you specifically elect to receive it.  Online discussion lists or "threads" are maintained and controlled in accordance with the City's <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/pan/ListServicesPolicies.htm">Electronic Conferencing and List Services Policy</a>. Survey information is used for the purpose identified by the survey.  Information from other online forms is used only for conducting City business related to the online form.<br>
<br>
Information provided for a transaction is used only for the purpose of completing and recording the transaction. Information requested will be no more specific than if a visitor were engaging in the transaction by other means, including by telephone or in-person while visiting a City facility. In all cases, the City strives to collect the minimum information necessary to comply with applicable law or provide the service requested.</p> 

<p>The City does not sell, rent or otherwise distribute visitor's information, including electronic mail addresses, to any outside company or organization, unless legally required to do so. This applies to information that may be collected on the City's site and on that of any third party with whom the City contracts to provide Internet related services.</p>

<p class="portalgroupheader"><a name="personal">Section C.  Personal Information and Choice</a></p>

<p>You may choose whether to provide personal information online.</p>

<p>"Personal information" is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual.  Personal information includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone number.  A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information.</p>  

<p>We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us by sending us e-mail, participating in a survey, completing an online form, or engaging in an online transaction.  You may choose not to contact us by e-mail, participate in a survey, provide personal information using an online form, or engage in an electronic transaction. However, some information available through this site is specific to individual users. Visitors interested in viewing this user specific information are requested to sign up for a password-protected account. Your choice to not participate in these activities will not impair your ability to browse, read, or download general information provided on the site. Information protected on this site by a password, which is subject to disclosure, may be obtained by contacting the City directly.</p>

<p>If personal information is requested on the web site or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it.  However, this information is treated like any other information provided to the city, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law.</p>

<p>If you believe that your personal information is being used for a purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact the person identified in the Contact Information Section of this statement.</p>

<p>Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children online or by e-mail will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public access.</p>

<p class="portalgroupheader"><a name="access">Section D.  Public Access to Information</a></p>

<p>In the State Of Washington, Public Disclosure laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by City government (The Public Disclosure Act or "PDA" <a href="http://www.leg.wa.gov/RCW/index.cfm?section=42.17.260&amp;fuseaction=section">RCW 42.17.260</a>).  At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals.  Both state and federal laws provide exceptions.  The PDA requires the disclosure of all public records unless a particular record (or particular information contained in a record) is specifically exempt under the PDA or other applicable law. For example, there is no categorical exemption for residential telephone numbers, residential addresses, or personal e-mail addresses. However, the PDA does not require the disclosure of "credit card numbers, debit card numbers, electronic check numbers, card expiration dates, or bank or other financial account numbers supplied to [the City] for the purpose of electronic transfer of funds, except when disclosure is expressly required by law" <a href="http://www.leg.wa.gov/RCW/index.cfm?section=42.17.310&amp;fuseaction=section">RCW 42.17.310(1)(ss)</a>.<br>
<br>
The PDA does not authorize the City to give, sell, or provide access to lists of individuals to entities seeking to use the lists for commercial purposes. City practice is to require those who request lists of individuals to sign an affidavit stating that they do not have a commercial purpose (such as contacting those on the list to propose a commercial transaction). However, the City cannot guarantee that a requester will not, despite signing such an affidavit, contact individuals on the list for a commercial purpose.<br>
<br>
In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and the Public Records Act or other law governing the disclosure of records, the Public Records Act or other applicable law will control.

<p class="portalgroupheader"><a name="fraud">Section I. Avoiding Internet Fraud</a></p>

<p>Fraudulent scams called "phishing" have been increasing in frequency. "Phishing" involves a victim receiving an e-mail appearing to be from a legitimate business. The "from" line is often forged and the e-mail usually contains authentic looking graphics making it appear to be legitimate. The e-mail may also contain what appears to be a legitimate link to that organization, e.g., <a href="http://www.seattle.gov">http://www.seattle.gov</a>. When the victim clicks on this link, they are then taken to what appears to be a legitimate looking website. Criminals can even make your browser's address bar contain the address of the legitimate organization despite the fact that the website is a forgery. Victims are then encouraged to enter personal information including credit card numbers and expiration dates.<br>
<br>
It is the City's policy never to request confidential personal or financial information from our customers via an unsolicited e-mail. The City will also never send you an unsolicited e-mail containing a link to a City website where confidential personal or financial information is requested. If you receive such an e-mail, purportedly from the City, you are encouraged to immediately contact the City's Citizen Service Bureau at: (206) 684-CITY.<br>
<br>
For more general information about "phishing" <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/phishingalrt.htm">visit the Federal Trade Commission web site</a>. For specific information about a suspected phishing attempt you may have received contact the organization represented in the suspect e-mail.
