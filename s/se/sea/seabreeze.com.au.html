<h1>Seabreeze.com.au Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Welcome! Read on how Seabreeze.com.au treats your personal information, along with ways to control your preferences and settings. </p>

<p>When you register we may ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, postcode, occupation, industry, and personal interests. For some products and services we might also ask for your address.</p>
<p>Seabreeze.com.au collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of services that we offer.</p>
<p>Seabreeze.com.au automatically receives and records information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, Seabreeze.com.au cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request.</p>
<p>Seabreeze.com.au uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.</p>
<p><b>Information Sharing &amp; Disclosure</b></p>
<p>Seabreeze.com.au does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Seabreeze.com.au under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Seabreeze.com.au communicate with you about offers from Seabreeze.com.au and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.</p>
<p>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process (such as law enforcement requests), or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>
<p>We believe it is necessary to view &amp; share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Seabreeze.com.au's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>We transfer information about you if Seabreeze.com.au is acquired by or merged with another company.</p>
<p>Seabreeze.com.au may display targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteriaâ€”for example, men ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.</p>
<p>Seabreeze.com.au does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.</p>
