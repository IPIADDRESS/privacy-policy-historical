					<p><strong>LAST UPDATED:</strong>  June 9, 2010<br>
<br>
We, SearchIgnite, Inc., are concerned about privacy issues and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose Personal Information (as defined below).  This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with Personal Information that we collect through <a href="http://www.searchignite.com/" target="_blank">http://www.searchignite.com/</a> (the <strong>"Site"</strong>) and offline in connection with the services we provide.  This Privacy Policy does not address the collection, use or disclosure of information through our SearchIgnite analytics services; if you wish to understand our practices with respect to information we collect via our SearchIgnite analytics services, please review our <a href="/en/about/privacy-services.html" target="_blank">SearchIgnite Services Privacy Policy</a>.   <br>
<br>
By providing Personal Information to us, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy.  If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy, please do not provide any Personal Information to us.  We reserve the right to change this Policy.  You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the "LAST UPDATED" legend at the top of this page.  Any changes to our Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Policy on the Site.  Use of the Site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Policy then in effect.<br>
<br>
<strong>1. What Types of Information Do We Collect From You?</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Personal Information</strong> is information that identifies you as an individual.  In order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided by us (for example, to sign up to be a customer or to register for a webinar), we may require that you furnish Personal Information.  We collect Personal Information from you, such as your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number or other payment account number, only when you voluntarily provide it to us.  <br>
<br>
<strong>Non-Personal Information</strong> is aggregated information, demographic information and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity.  We and our third party service providers may collect Non-Personal Information from you, including your MAC address, computer type, screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, demographic data (for example your country), as well as information collected through the use of cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other similar technologies to better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing use of our Site and our services.  We and our third party service providers may also aggregate Personal Information in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other person, for example, by using Personal Information to calculate the number of customers we have in a particular state.  If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies.  You can also delete the cookie we set for you.  This will eliminate our ability to link your past behavior with future behavior, but we will be able to monitor your future behavior based on a new cookie we supply.  To learn more about cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>.<br>
<br>
<strong>IP Addresses.</strong>  Your IP Address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).  This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever users visit the Site, along with the time(s) of such visit(s) and the page(s) that were visited.  Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.  <br>
<br>
<strong>2. How Does We Use Information Collected From You?</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Personal Information.</strong>  We may use Personal Information:<br>
<img src="/images/carat_orange.gif" width="6" height="8" border="0" style="padding-right: 10px;">   for the purpose for which it was provided (e.g., to provide services to you and contact you regarding these services, to sign you up as a customer or partner and/or to send requested information to you).<br>
<img src="/images/carat_orange.gif" width="6" height="8" border="0" style="padding-right: 10px;">   for billing and customer care purposes (e.g., to fulfill your purchase of services). <br>
<img src="/images/carat_orange.gif" width="6" height="8" border="0" style="padding-right: 10px;">   to respond to your problems and comments. <br>
<img src="/images/carat_orange.gif" width="6" height="8" border="0" style="padding-right: 10px;">   to approve and enable your participation in the Site and Site services (e.g., to permit you to subscribe to our blogs and RSS feeds, as applicable).<br>
<img src="/images/carat_orange.gif" width="6" height="8" border="0" style="padding-right: 10px;">   to permit you to participate in a webinar. <br>
<img src="/images/carat_orange.gif" width="6" height="8" border="0" style="padding-right: 10px;">   to permit you to request access to our client login on the Site, and use our client login and the services offered therein (e.g., permit you to review your company's bill), as applicable.<br>
<img src="/images/carat_orange.gif" width="6" height="8" border="0" style="padding-right: 10px;">   to inform you of products, programs, services and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you.   <br>
<img src="/images/carat_orange.gif" width="6" height="8" border="0" style="padding-right: 10px;">   to send you important information regarding the Site, changes to our terms, conditions, and policies and/or other administrative information.  Because this information may be important, you may not opt-out of receiving such communications.<br>
<img src="/images/carat_orange.gif" width="6" height="8" border="0" style="padding-right: 10px;">   for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, enhancing our website, improving our services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns.<br>
<br>
<strong>Non-Personal Information.</strong>  Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose.  In addition, we reserve the right to share such Non Personal Information, which does not personally identify you, with affiliates and other third parties, for any purpose.  In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location).  If we do combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information hereunder as long as it is so combined.  <br>
<br>
<strong>IP Addresses.</strong>  We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, administering the Site and tracking your Internet usage, including identifying your geographic location.  We may also use and disclose IP Addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.  Please note that we treat IP Addresses, server log files and related information as Non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.  <br>
<br>
<strong>3. How Is Personal Information Disclosed?</strong>  We may disclose Personal Information:<br>
<img src="/images/carat_orange.gif" width="6" height="8" border="0" style="padding-right: 10px;">   to our <a href="http://www.innovationinteractive.com/affiliates.html" target="_blank">affiliates</a> so that they may use such Personal Information for the purposes described in this policy.  SearchIgnite, Inc. is the party responsible for the management of the jointly-used Personal Information.<br>
<img src="/images/carat_orange.gif" width="6" height="8" border="0" style="padding-right: 10px;">   to our third party service providers who provide services such as website hosting, data analysis, payment processing, order fulfillment, infrastructure provision, IT services, customer service, email delivery services, credit card processing and other similar services to enable them to provide services.  For example, we may use third party analytics services, and they may place cookies on your computer and record data about your Site usage on our behalf.<br>
<img src="/images/carat_orange.gif" width="6" height="8" border="0" style="padding-right: 10px;">   to an affiliate or other third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).<br>
<img src="/images/carat_orange.gif" width="6" height="8" border="0" style="padding-right: 10px;">   as we believe to be appropriate: (a) under applicable law including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others; and (g) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.<br>
<br>
<strong>4. Other Important Notices Regarding Our Privacy Practices.</strong><br>

<strong>Third Party Sites.</strong>  This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including without limitation any of our affiliates and any third party operating any site to which this Site contains a link.

<br>
<strong>Third Party Advertisers.</strong>  We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on the Site and/or on the sites on which we advertise.  Please note that these companies may use information (not including Personal Information) about your visit to the applicable site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.  In the course of serving advertisements, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.  In addition, we may use web beacons provided by third-party advertising companies to help manage our online advertising.

<br>
<strong>Security.</strong>  We use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information under our control.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Please do not send us sensitive information through email.  If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the <em>"Contacting Us"</em> section below (note that if you choose to notify us via physical mail, this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem).<br>
<br>
<strong>Opt-Out.</strong>  If you no longer wish to receive marketing-related emails from us on a going-forward basis, or if you would prefer that we do not share Personal Information about you on a going-forward basis with our affiliates for our affiliates' marketing purposes, you may opt-out of receiving such marketing-related emails or from such sharing by sending an email containing your request to <a href="mailto: privacy@searchignite.com">privacy@searchignite.com</a>.  Please specify clearly which of the following choices you are opting out of:<br>

<br>
We will endeavor to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.  For your protection, we will only implement opt-out requests with respect to the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.  Please note that if you opt-out as described above, we will not be able to remove your Personal Information from the databases of our affiliates with which we have already shared your Personal Information (i.e., to which we have already provided your Personal Information as of the date that we implement your opt-out request).  If you wish to cease receiving marketing-related emails from such affiliates, please contact such affiliates directly or utilize any opt-out mechanisms set forth in their respective privacy policies or marketing-related emails.<br>
<br>
<strong>Changing or Suppressing Personal Information.</strong>  If you would like to change, suppress or otherwise limit our use of your Personal Information that has been previously provided to us, you may contact us by sending an email containing your request to <a href="mailto: privacy@searchignite.com">privacy@searchignite.com</a>.
