		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

	
<p>SearchIgnite, a division of Innovation Interactive LLC, ("SearchIgnite") values its users and their concerns about privacy. SearchIgnite engages in consistent information practices and uses reasonable commercial efforts to clearly disclose those practices. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") is a part of that effort. The instances in which SearchIgnite collects, stores and uses information it obtains through your use of the SearchIgnite services ("Services") are specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy. Other services offered by Innovation Interactive and its subsidiaries are governed by other privacy policies. This Privacy Policy may be part of the terms and conditions or End User License Agreement ("EULA") to which you agreed.</p>
<p>What does this Privacy Policy cover?<br>
This Privacy Policy applies to the collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by SearchIgnite through your use of the Services. If there are any exceptions, we will clearly disclose them prior to collecting any information, and will give you an opportunity to choose not to participate or provide the information. By using the Services, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we outline in this Privacy Policy. SearchIgnite may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post any changes here so that you are always informed of the information we collect, how we use it, and the circumstances under which we disclose it.<br>
SearchIgnite is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices or the content of third party Web sites or applications.</p>
<p>SearchIgnite may collect any or all of the following types of information: (a) traffic or clickstream data, (b) cookies, (c) Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses, or (d) contact information and other personally identifying information. SearchIgnite's collection and use of each type of data is described below, as well as the ways (if any) in which the data may be shared with third parties.</p>
<p>(a) Traffic or Clickstream Data.  Data about traffic and usage, including keywords, search results, bids, time of search, time of click, browser type and default language setting, is not personally identifying or identifiable, and is not supplemented or combined with personally identifying or identifiable information. SearchIgnite may share information it collects with certain selected third parties, but only in anonymous form Importantly, all information collected from a search query is recorded on a non-personally identifiable basis and is kept anonymous. SearchIgnite collects some information regarding use of the Services by observing browser functions and the files (pages) users access. In addition to the foregoing applications, SearchIgnite uses the information (in aggregate form) to better design and market the Services.</p>
<p>(b) Cookies..  Like many companies, SearchIgnite collects information about online behavior using cookies. In order to provide search engine optimization services through the Services, SearchIgnite places tracking tags on your web site. SearchIgnite tracks usage of your web site through cookies.

<p>(c) IP Addresses..  An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer each time you connect to the Internet. When you use your web browser to request a web page from another computer on the Internet, your web browser automatically gives that computer your IP address so that the data you request can be sent to your computer. Through your IP address, SearchIgnite may track your Internet usage, including identifying Affiliates and geographic location, which may be disclosed to advertisers, search engines and other partners. SearchIgnite may strip a portion of numbers from your IP address and provide such information to our third-party advertising companies. This information collected by SearchIgnite though your IP address is not personally identifiable.</p>
<p>(d) Contact Information or Personally Identifying Information.   SearchIgnite may obtain access to your name, e-mail address, physical address, telephone number, fax number, credit card number and other contact or personally identifiable information, when you: (1) sign up for the Service or; (2) provide comments, submit a problem, or request information from SearchIgnite.

<p>The contact information that you provide to SearchIgnite is used for billing, marketing and customer care purposes. Contact information specifically provided in connection with problems, comments or requests is used only to respond to those problems, comments or requests. This contact information is only provided to a third party if necessary to respond to the comment, problem or request. The information you submit through the SearchIgnite will also be disclosed to the subject search engines. The information submitted to the subject search engines will be held pursuant to their privacy policies. SearchIgnite may disclose this information to third parties under the following circumstances: (i) to the subject search engines if you use SearchIgnite; (ii) to SearchIgnite's independent auditors, consultants or attorneys, all of whom are obliged to keep such information confidential; (iii) to comply with government agency or court orders or requests; and (iv) in aggregated and non-personally identifiable form to promote and market the Services. SearchIgnite employs other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as hosting and other technical services. To perform those functions, it may be necessary for these parties to obtain access to SearchIgnite's servers that may contain personally identifying information. These parties are bound by appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
<p>In addition, as companies grow and change, we may buy and sell companies, subsidiaries and assets. In such transactions, customer information is generally one of the transferred business asset. In the event that SearchIgnite is acquired, your information may be one of the transferred assets.</p>
<p>Is data stored by SearchIgnite secure?
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, SearchIgnite has put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information it collects online.
