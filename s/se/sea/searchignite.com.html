		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

	
<p>
SearchIgnite, Inc. (“Searchignite”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Innovation Interactive Inc. (“Innovation Interactive”), values its users and their concerns about privacy. SearchIgnite engages in consistent information practices and uses reasonable commercial efforts to clearly disclose those practices. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") is a part of that effort. The instances in which SearchIgnite collects, stores and uses information it obtains through your use of the SearchIgnite Services through our websites or through your use of the SearchIgnite services on our clients’ websites (collectively,"Services") are specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy. Other services offered by Innovation Interactive and its subsidiaries are governed by other privacy policies.

<b>It is very important that you review the respective privacy policy of each website that you visit, because such privacy policies govern the use of information on those websites, including our client’s use of the Services.
</b>
</p>

<p><b>Clients</b><br>

SearchIgnite serves as an agent for each of our clients, in that we provide the Services for the benefit of our clients.  Each of our clients uses the Services to help maximize their advertising campaign.  Each client instructs us as to what types of data it would like us to collect on their behalf, including personally identifiable data such as purchase behavior.   We may track certain actions on our client’s websites, including users visiting certain pages on our client’s sites or users’ specific actions on these sites.  We use persistent cookies and a variety of other tracking mechanisms to determine activity at the client’s sites.  With respect to individuals who visit those websites as a result of clicking on a customer ad on a search engine, our ad server will place a unique tracking code on the computer and will use non-personally identifiable information about the browser and activity at this site (such as a user’s IP address, web pages that have been viewed by a user, date and time) to track whether the referral results in a transaction, as defined by our client.  All of this information may be passed back to our clients and the use of this information is subject to each client’s privacy policy.

</p>

<p>
<b>What information does SearchIgnite collect and use and what ways (if any) does SearchIgnite share this information with third parties?
</b><br>
SearchIgnite may collect any or all of the following types of information: (a) traffic or clickstream data, (b) cookies, (c) Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses, or (d) contact information and other personally identifying information. SearchIgnite's collection and use of each type of data is described below, as well as the ways (if any) in which the data may be shared with third parties.
<br><br>

(a) Traffic or Clickstream Data. (i) For users of the SearchIgnite website, data about traffic and usage, including keywords, search results, bids, time of search, time of click, browser type and default language setting, is not personally identifying or identifiable, and is not supplemented or combined with personally identifying or identifiable information. SearchIgnite may share information it collects with certain selected third parties, but only in anonymous form; (b) For users of our clients’ websites, data about traffic and usage, including keywords, search results, bid, time of search, time of click, browser type and default language setting may be supplemented and combined with personally identifying or identifiable information that the client collects and may be passed back to our clients. SearchIgnite collects some information regarding use of the Services by observing browser functions and the files (pages) users access. In addition to the foregoing applications, SearchIgnite uses the information (in aggregate form) to better design and market the Services.
<br><br>(b) Cookies. Like many companies, SearchIgnite collects information about online behavior using cookies. In order to provide search engine optimization services through the Services, SearchIgnite places tracking tags on its website and its clients’ websites. These cookies track your usage on these websites. They contain identification information that lets us know about repeat visitors and if our marketing campaigns are successful. SearchIgnite may also use cookies to identify which sites our repeat visitors are coming from. To SearchIgnite, using information within cookies is a way to improve the value of the Services to the users of the SearchIgnite website as well as our clients’ websites. SearchIgnite may share information about usage of the Services on a client’s website with that particular client.  SearchIgnite may share information about the usage of the Services with third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form.
<br><br>(c) IP Addresses. An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer each time you connect to the Internet. When you use your web browser to request a web page from another computer on the Internet, your web browser automatically gives that computer your IP address so that the data you request can be sent to your computer. Through your IP address, SearchIgnite may track your Internet usage, including identifying Affiliates and geographic location, which may be disclosed to advertisers, search engines and other partners. SearchIgnite may strip a portion of numbers from your IP address and provide such information to our third-party advertising companies. This information collected by SearchIgnite though your IP address is not personally identifiable.
<br><br>

(d) Contact Information or Personally Identifying Information. SearchIgnite may obtain access to your name, e-mail address, physical address, telephone number, fax number, credit card number and other contact or personally identifiable information, when: (1) you become an advertiser with SearchIgnite; ; (2) you provide comments, submit a problem, or request information from SearchIgnite, or (3) SearchIgnite’s clients pass such information to us.
<br><br>When you become an advertiser with SearchIgnite, your contact information is used for billing, marketing and customer care purposes as well as for the purpose of approving and enabling your participation in the Services.
<br><br>Contact information specifically provided in connection with problems, comments or requests is used only to respond to those problems, comments or requests. This contact information is only provided to a third party if necessary to respond to the comment, problem or request. The information you submit through the SearchIgnite will also be disclosed to the subject search engines. The information submitted to the subject search engines will be held pursuant to their privacy policies. 
<br><br>
When you use one of our client’s sites, the client may pass your contact  information to SearchIgnite.  Such information may be supplemented or combined with your traffic and usage information and may be disclosed to such client.  Any information obtained by SearchIgnite from our client’s web sites and any other information provided to SearchIgnite as directed by its clients is our client’s property and will be treated as proprietary and confidential information of our client.  SearchIgnite may disclose this personally identifiable information to third parties under the following circumstances: ( (i) to the client who has passed this information to SearchIgnite; (ii) to SearchIgnite's independent auditors, consultants or attorneys, all of whom are obliged to keep such information confidential; (iii) to comply with government agency or court orders or requests; and (iv) in aggregated and non-personally identifiable form to promote and market the Services. SearchIgnite employs other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as hosting and other technical services. To perform those functions, it may be necessary for these parties to obtain access to SearchIgnite's servers that may contain personally identifying information. These parties are bound by appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
<br><br>In addition, as companies grow and change, we may buy and sell companies, subsidiaries and assets. In such transactions, customer information is generally one of the transferred business assets. In the event that SearchIgnite is acquired, your information may be one of the transferred assets.
<br><br>
<b>Is data stored by SearchIgnite secure? </b>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, SearchIgnite has put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information it collects online. However, data security is a constantly evolving art and science. You should consider any communication that you transmit to SearchIgnite (such as data, questions or answers, comments, or suggestions) as non-confidential, and agree that SearchIgnite will not be liable or responsible if information that belongs to you is intercepted and used by an unintended recipient.
<br><br>
<b>How can I access or correct any personally identifying information about me? </b>
To request a copy of the personally identifiable information you have sent to SearchIgnite, through your use of the SearchIgnite website (and not through the use of the Services through our clients’ web sites) please send an e-mail containing your request to privacy@searchignite.com You must provide your full name and the e-mail from which the request is received (and to which the response will be sent) must match the e-mail on file with SearchIgnite. You may then correct or delete such information using the procedures specified in the e-mail.

<br><br>
<b>How do I find out more about SearchIgnite's information practices?</b> If you have any questions about anything in this Privacy Policy, or about collection of personally identifiable information, or information generally, please contact SearchIgnite as follows:
