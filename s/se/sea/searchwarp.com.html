We never sell your personal information to third parties. The SearchWarp.com Web site is owned and operated by IcoLogic, Inc.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions regarding our privacy statement, please feel free to contact us.<br>
<br>
<strong>Gathering of Information </strong>
<p>
	<strong>Voluntary Submission</strong></p>
<p>
	SearchWarp.com does not collect personally identifying information about any individual web site user except when knowingly provided by such individual. For example, when a visitor comes to SearchWarp.com to read an article, we do not ask for nor do we collect personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Search Engine / Web Site Directory</strong></p>
<p>
	When a person submits a URL to be evaluated and possibly added to our search index and/or our directory of web sites, we require the person to include an email address to receive a confirmation email when the URL has been added to our database.&nbsp; You always have the option not to provide the information we request. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still utilize most of the SearchWarp.com Web site, but you may be unable to access certain options and services.</p>
<p>
	Each SearchWarp.com search engine listing allows for an email address to be associated with it, which is provided by the person who submits the URL for listing at the time of submission.&nbsp;SearchWarp is part of a network of search engine and directory web sites and these search engines exchange listing information to give the user more exposure for their web site.&nbsp; These network search engine and directory web sites may also receive the email address submitted along with the listing URL and may use this email address for business contact purposes</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
	<br>
	A cookie is a data file that certain Web sites write to your computer's hard drive when you visit such sites. A cookie file can contain information, such as a user identification code, that the site uses to track the pages you have visited. SearchWarp.com uses cookies solely to track user traffic patterns throughout the SearchWarp.com Web site.

However, if you choose to disable the receipt of cookies from our Web site, you may not be able to use certain features of the site.</p>
<p>

These parties, as well as advertisers who contract directly with a third-party service to serve their advertisements, may set their own cookies.</p>
<p>
