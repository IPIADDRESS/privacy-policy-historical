                At SearchWarp.com, we recognize that privacy of your personal 
information is important. Here is information on what types of personal 
information we receive and collect when you use visit SearchWarp.com, and how we 
safeguard your information. We never sell your personal information to third 
parties. The SearchWarp.com Web site is owned and 
            operated by IcoLogic, Inc.<br>
            <br>
            If you have any questions regarding our privacy statement, please 
            feel free to contact us though our

<p><font size="2">
SearchWarp.com does not collect personally identifying information about any 
individual web site user except when 
            knowingly provided by such individual. For example, when a visitor 
            comes to SearchWarp.com to read an article, we do not 
            ask for nor do we collect personally identifiable information.&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#0066CC">Search Engine / Web Site Directory</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2">
When a person submits a URL to be evaluated and possibly added to 
            our search index and/or our directory of web sites, we require the person to include an email address to 
            receive a confirmation email when the URL has been added to our 
            database.&nbsp; You always have the option not to provide the 
            information we request. If you choose not to provide the information 
            we request, you can still utilize most of the SearchWarp.com Web 
            site, but you may be unable to access certain options and services.
            </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Each SearchWarp.com search engine listing allows 
            for an email address to be associated with it, which is provided by 
            the person who submits the URL for listing at the time of 
            submission.&nbsp;SearchWarp is part of a network of search engine 
			and directory web sites and these search engines exchange listing 
			information to give the user more exposure for their web site.&nbsp; 
			These network search engine and directory web sites may also receive 
			the email address submitted along with the listing URL and may use 
			this email address for business contact purposes</font></p>

            A cookie is a data file that certain Web sites write to your 
            computer's hard drive when you visit such sites. A cookie file can 
            contain information, such as a user identification code, that the 
            site uses to track the pages you have visited. SearchWarp.com uses 
            cookies solely to track user traffic patterns throughout the 
            SearchWarp.com Web site. We use this data on an anonymous basis and 
            we do not correlate this information with personal data of any user.
            <br>
            <br>
            Most Web site browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can 
            usually change your browser settings to display a warning before 
            accepting a cookie, or to refuse all cookies. However, if you choose 
            to disable the receipt of cookies from our Web site, you may not be 
            able to use certain features of the site. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">We also use third party advertisements on SearchWarp.com to 
help support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies 
and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these 
advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information 
including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, 
and various browser options you may have installed on your web browser. This is generally used for 
geotargeting purposes or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited.<br>

            <b>Browser Level Information </b></font></p>
<p><font size="2">As with most other websites, we collect and use the data 
contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP 
address, your Internet Service Provider, the web browser you used to visit our site, the time you visited our site and which pages you visited 
throughout our site. If available, we may also record referral information to 
determine how you were referred to our site from external web sites.</font></p>

            <b>Use of Information</b> </font> <br>
            <br>
            Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your 
experience on our Web site. We achieve this goal by, among other things, 
providing interactive communications such as our welcome email, and developing 
future products and services based on your interests. To develop content 
targeted to your interests, we use aggregated user information to determine 
which areas of our Web site users prefer based upon traffic to those areas. <br>
            <br>
            SearchWarp.com derives the majority of its revenue from 
            advertising. In order to attract and retain advertisers we may use 
            the aggregated, anonymous information that we gather to describe our 
            services to partners and to assist our advertisers and sponsors to 
            better understand our audience. We do not disclose personally 
            identifying information about our users to these parties. <br>
            <br>
            SearchWarp.com may also disclose information about our users when 
            we believe, in good faith, that the disclosure is required by law.</font></p>

            When you are on an area of SearchWarp.com and are asked for 
            personal information, you are sharing that information with 
            SearchWarp.com as well as business partners and vendors providing 
            hosting and other services for SearchWarp.com. If you do not want 
            your information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the 
            transfer of your information by not using that particular service. 
            These parties, as well as advertisers who contract directly with a 
            third-party service to serve their advertisements, may set their own 
            cookies. <br>
            <br>
            In addition, any personally identifiable information provided by our 
            users as part of an advertiser promotion online may be provided 
            directly to advertisers. <br>

            <b>IP address:</b> </font>Every computer connected to the Internet has a 
            numeric address called an “IP address." This may or may not 
            correspond uniquely to a particular computer. In some cases, IP 
            addresses can be resolved to domain names, which may indicate a site 
            visitor's Internet service provider, employer, university, etc. As 
            part of its database analysis SearchWarp.com resolves IP addresses

            <b>Browser type:</b></font> A user’s browser is a software program running 
            on a computer that allows users to access documents on the World 
            Wide Web. Browsers can be either text or graphic. They read HTML 
            coded pages that reside on a server and interpret the coding into 
            what the user sees as Web pages. Netscape Navigator and Microsoft 
            Internet Explorer are examples of Web browsers. Browser type 
            typically discloses hardware platform, operating system, and browser
