Exactly what Enlightenment represent&nbsp;is not easy to describe, but we can say that it is the liberation from the material world and its dualism. Now the question is: can mobile devices actually help keep you focused and achieve this state? Can an app really bring a sense of calm? Yes, they can and here you can find&nbsp;many Zen apps to help you meditate and be mindful.&nbsp;</p>
