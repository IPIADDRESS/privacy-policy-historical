Refusing to provide some of this information may lead to us being unable to provide you with the products or services you’ve requested.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>A prime example of limited access to our website is where content may be protected by a username and password. Whether a username and password are generated by our website or created by you, these will almost always be connected with some other information related to or connected with you. This is true since much content that is protected on the internet is subscription based, often paid for. Thus, the username and password must necessarily be tied to your other account data. Usernames and passwords, by their very nature, should be kept private.</div>

<div><strong>What Data We Collect About You</strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>Personal data means any information capable of identifying an individual. It does not include anonymized data.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We may process certain types of personal data about you as follows:</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>• Identity Data may include your first name, maiden name, last name, username, marital status, title, date of birth and gender.</div>
<div>• Contact Data may include your billing address, delivery address, email address and telephone numbers.</div>
<div>• Financial Data may include your bank account and payment card details.</div>
<div>• Transaction Data may include details about payments between us and other details of purchases made by you.</div>
<div>• Technical Data may include your login data, internet protocol addresses, browser type and version, browser plug-in types and versions, time zone setting and location, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access this site.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>We may also process Aggregated Data from your personal data but this data does not reveal your identity and as such in itself is not personal data. An example of this is where we review your Usage Data to work out the percentage of website users using a specific feature of our site. If we link the Aggregated Data with your personal data so that you can be identified from it, then it is treated as personal data.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>

<div>We do not collect any Sensitive Data about you.

<div></div>
<div><strong>Handling of Personal Information&nbsp;</strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>Note that any personal information you provide to others apart from us or our vendors is wholly optional. As an example, you might disclose something in a blog post comment. That “private” information is now “public,” and we have no control over that. In like fashion, you sharing information with any other third party not functioning as a service provider to us puts that information beyond our control and becomes subject to the policy that party has in place.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Our primary intention for collecting personal and private information from you is simply to conduct our business. We can use this internally to better serve you. Accordingly, we see no reason to share your personal information with other parties and outside interests unless you have authorized us to do so.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Of course, there are instances where your information is stored with third party service providers, such as email service providers, as they provide services that are industry-leading in quality and security and are far more beneficial to our end user than attempting such services “in-house.” However, you are never required to deal with any such third party directly, they are limited in how they use your information, and they cannot sell or transfer it to others in any way.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>However, of course, your information does comprise part of an overall whole. This aggregate of information, by contrast, may be used to understand our overall user base. Further, we may share this information about our website visitors as a whole, not individually, with third parties for various purposes, in our sole discretion.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>While we are staunch privacy advocates, there are times when even we may be forced to abandon these ideals. Just as major search engines face ongoing compulsion to provide data against their will, so too may the same occur with our website. Illegal activity or other serious acts or allegations could create legal liability for our website. In those cases, we reserve the right to share your information, or else may simply be compelled to do so by law.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>On the other hand, there may be times when we would need to share your private information in order to protect our own interests. For instance, in cases of suspected or alleged copyright infringement or other intellectual property violations, it may be necessary to share personal information.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Disclosures of your personal data.</strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the section above titled “Lawful basis and purposes for processing personal data”</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>• Service providers who provide IT and system administration services.</div>
<div>• Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors, and insurers.</div>
<div>• Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities based in the United Kingdom and other relevant jurisdictions who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.</div>
<div>• Third parties to whom we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>We only permit such third parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Marketing communications</strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have:</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>(a) requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us; or</div>
<div>(b) if you provided us with your details and ticked the box at the point of entry of your details for us to send you marketing communications; and</div>
<div>(c) in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you OR by emailing us at support@seanwalters.com at any time..</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>Where you opt out of receiving our marketing communications, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Change of purpose &nbsp;</strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another purpose and that purpose is compatible with the original purpose.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>If we need to use your personal data for a purpose unrelated to the purpose for which we collected the data, we will notify you and we will explain the legal ground of processing.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>We may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Third-party service providers outside of the European Economic Area.</strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>Many of our third parties service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>• We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; or</div>
<div>• Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or</div>
<div>• Where we use providers based in the United States, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Please email us at support@seanwalters.com if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Data Security</strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>We have in place appropriate security measures to protect your personal data and to prevent it from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. Additionally, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know such data. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Retention of Data</strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>We only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>We are legally required to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see below for further information.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>We reserve the right to anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</div>

<div><strong>Comments Policy&nbsp;</strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>As you know, Web 2.0 is all about the conversation. But without a few simple ground rules, that conversation can turn into a shouting match that discourages others from entering into the fray.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>So here is Alpha Marketing Systems comments policy. By posting on my blog, you agree to the following:</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>You may comment without registering. You can log-in via Disqus, OpenID, Twitter, Facebook—or not at all. It’s up to you. You may post anonymously. I don’t recommend this, but you may do so if you wish. I may change this rule if it is abused.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>You may post follow-up questions. If you have a question, chances are you are not alone. Others are likely thinking similarly. Therefore, I would rather receive your comments on Alpha Marketing Systems than via email. It is a better use of my time to address everyone at once rather than answer several similar emails.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You may disagree with me. I welcome debate. However, I ask that if you disagree with me—or anyone else, for that matter—do so in a way that is respectful. In my opinion, there is way too much shouting in the public square to tolerate it here.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>Alpha Marketing Systems reserves the right to delete your comments. This is my blog. I don’t have an obligation to publish your comments. The First Amendment gives you the right to express your opinions on your blog, not mine.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>Specifically, I will delete your comments if you post something that is, in my sole opinion, (a)snarky; (b) off-topic; (c) libelous, defamatory, abusive, harassing, threatening, profane, pornographic, offensive, false, misleading, or which otherwise violates or encourages others to violate my sense of decorum and civility or any law, including intellectual property laws; or (d) “spam,” i.e., an attempt to advertise, solicit, or otherwise promote goods and services. You may, however, post a link to your site or your most recent blog post.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>You retain ownership of your comments. I do not own them and I expressly disclaim any and all liability that may result from them. By commenting on my site, you agree that you retain all ownership rights in what you post here and that you will relieve me from any and all liability that may result from those postings.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>You grant Alpha Marketing Systems a license to post your comments. This license is worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, and royalty-free. You grant me the right to store, use, transmit, display, publish, reproduce, and distribute your comments in any format, including but not limited to a blog, in a book, a video, or presentation.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>In short, my goal is to host interesting conversations with caring, honest, and respectful people. I believe this simple comments policy will facilitate this.</div>
