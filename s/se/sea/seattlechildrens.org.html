      <h1 id="content">Privacy Statement</h1>
      <p>Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center (Children's) is committed to providing its users with an Internet experience that respects and protects their personal privacy choices and concerns.</p>
      <p>We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the website: www.seattlechildrens.org.</p>
      <p>This site contains links to other sites. Children's is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.</p>
      <h2>Your Privacy Rights</h2>
      <p>Children's is committed to keeping your child or teen's health information private and confidential. 
        Our Notice of Privacy Practices tells how we use your child's health information and lists reasons why we would need to give 
        this information to others.</p>

      <h2>Traffic Data Collected</h2>
      <p>When you use our site, we collect anonymous information. Anonymous information is information about how you use our site (such as places visited and searches performed). </p>
      <p>Anonymous information also includes the domain names and/or IP addresses of browsers that visit our site, time of day the site was visited, and other non-personally identifiable information. Anonymous information is information that is not tied to any individual, but helps to characterize Children's users to improve our services.</p>
      <p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. We use cookies to identify returning visitors, so that they do not have to reenter a password whenever they return to our site.</p>
      <h2>Personal Information Collected</h2>
      <p>Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect a visitor's contact information (such as an e-mail address) and financial information (such as an account or credit card numbers) in the online gift store and the Ways to Help sections. This information is used to fulfill orders and process payments or donations.</p>
      <p>The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. For example, we might have a question about the processing of an order. If a user so requests, we may use the contact information to send the user additional information about Children's.</p>
      <p>Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section below). Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address). The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary. Again, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section below).</p>
      <h2>Secure Area</h2>
      <p>When you register for access to the secured content area for Medical Staff and Healthcare Professionals we ask for information such as your name, title, practice name and address, email address, phone number and role.</p>
      <p>This information is used to confirm your identity, the appropriateness of your request to access sensitive healthcare information and to improve your experience by presenting you with appropriate content.</p>
      <p>Once you register and sign in, you are not anonymous to us. In the event of abuse, this information may be used to revoke your existing access to this and other Children's systems.</p>
      <p>You may request to have your account for accessing the secured section of the Health Care Professionals area removed by <a href="/home/contact/contact_form.asp?name=Web%20Services&amp;email=ehealth">sending an e-mail</a> including your name, practice and userid to us.</p>
      <p>The personally identifiable information we collect is not used for any purposes other than order fulfillment, processing of donations, dissemination of information and authentication to the secured content on this web site.</p>
      <p>It is not disclosed to anyone other than Children's and its partners, contractors and agents, unless we must do so to comply with a court order or other legal process, or we must do so to protect our rights or property.</p>
