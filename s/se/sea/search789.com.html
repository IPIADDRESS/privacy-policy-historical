        information. In order to ensure your privacy, information we 
        collect from Search789.com and other Search789 operated 
        websites (hereinafter referred to as the "Web sites" is used 
        only in the manner and for the purposes described 
        below.<br>
        <br>
        Anonymous User Information: Search789 collects 
        some anonymous information each time you visit our Websites so 
        we can improve the overall quality of your online experience. 
        We collect your IP address, referral data, and browser and

        before we can collect this anonymous information. We do not

        you to share information that identifies you personally, such 
        as your name or email address, in order for you to use the 
        Website search. Search789 assigns an anonymous ID number to 
        your requests and links the following additional data to that 
        number: the date and time you visited the Website, your search 
        terms, and the links upon which you choose to click. Like most 
        standard Web site servers, we use log files to collect and 
        store this anonymous user information. We analyze this 
        information to examine trends, administer the site, track 
        user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic 
        information for aggregate use. Search789 may present links in 
        a format that enables us to understand whether they have been 
        followed. We use this information to understand and improve 
        the quality of the Website search. <br>
        <br>
        Cookies: We use a 
        feature of Internet web browsers called a "cookie," which is a 
        small file that is sent to your computer when you visit a 
        website. This enables us to store user preferences and track 
        user trends and search patterns. We use cookies to improve the 
        quality of the services and to better understand how users 
        interact with us. We do not and cannot use Cookies to retrieve 
        individual personally identifiable information about you from 
        your computer unless you knowingly and willingly provided such 
        information. The cookie technology we use cannot obtain 
        information from your hard drive or pass on a computer virus. 
        You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to 
        indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Website 
        features or services may not function properly without 
        cookies. <br>

        unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. We
