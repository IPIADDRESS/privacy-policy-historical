		  <p class="subHead" id="Advertisements">What About Online Advertisements?</p>
		  <p class="regtext">We partner with third-party service providers known as Ad Networks to serve ads on
		    our behalf across the Internet. Using Cookies and Pixel Tags (also known as Web
		    Beacons), Ad Networks collect anonymous information about your visits to our web
		    site and other web sites in order to deliver advertisements that may be of particular
		    interest to you. This process does not involve the collection of any personally
		    identifiable information (PII). The Ad Networks do not know your name, phone
		    number, address, email address or any personally identifying information. If you
		    do not wish to receive relevant ads based on this technology, you can opt-out by
		    visiting the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) opt-out page *<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>*</p>
		  <p class="regtext">This web site may also carry advertisements from other companies. Sears Holdings
		    and its affiliates are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other
		    companies. Once you click on an advertisement, you should check the applicable
		    privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine, among other things,
		    how they will handle any PII they collect from you. These third party advertisements
		    may also contain cookies or web beacons. We do not control these third party
		    cookies or web beacons and you should check the applicable privacy policy of the
		    third party or advertiser site to see whether and how it uses cookies or web beacons.</p>

		  <p class="subHead" id="InformationSecure">Is My Information Secure?</p>
		  <p class="regtext">We maintain reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic and procedural
		    safeguards to protect your information. Your information is located on a secured
		    server behind a firewall. When you enter PII, we encrypt that information using
		    secure socket layer technology (“SSL”). While we do work very hard to protect your
