In some instances, we will share your contact information with carefully selected service providers to assist us in processing your online transactions or to deliver the services requested. For example, if you are a patron who requests information about a certain event hosted by one of our clients, we will supply your contact information to our clients who will then contact you to complete your request.

Potential Clients who request more information may have their information shared with a third party company only for purposes of ensuring that the potential client receives the information requested.</font></div>

				<div id="contentHeader"><font id="contentHighlightFont">How we use your e-mail address</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">We recognize that e-mail can be the preferred mode of communication for some of our patrons and clients. If you provide us with your e-mail address when registering for an online service or product or when accessing your account online, we will use it to contact you about online services and products for which you have registered or about your account.</font></div>
				<div id="contentHeader"><font id="contentHighlightFont">We may use your e-mail address to send you the following types of e-mail messages</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody">
                <ul>
				<li><font id="contentTextFont">Service notifications related to your accounts</font></li>
				<li><font id="contentTextFont">Regularly scheduled e-mail information related to SeatAdvisor, Inc.</font></li>
				<li><font id="contentTextFont">Product or service information</font></li>
				<li><font id="contentTextFont">Optional e-mail communications which you have signed up for (e.g. newsletters)</font></li>
				<li><font id="contentTextFont">Occasional updates about our products and services as well as SeatAdvisor, Inc. marketing offers</font></li>
				</ul></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">Also, once you have requested information from us, we may communicate with you via e-mail regarding your request to provide additional information related to your initial information request. For example, we may send you materials to help you prepare for an upcoming meeting with an SeatAdvisor, Inc. advisor. However, we will never ask you to send personal information such as account or Social Security numbers by non-secure e-mail.</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">To make our e-mail more relevant to you, we may use information you provided in your initial transaction with us, in surveys, from information we have about you as a patron or client and information available from external sources.</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">We do not share your e-mail address with non-affiliated companies for them to market their products or services directly to you. However, we may partner with selected non-affiliated companies to offer certain products or services we believe may be of interest to you.</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">You may receive e-mail offers from other companies for SeatAdvisor, Inc. products and services if you registered to receive third-party offers on their website, or if you receive ongoing e-mail newsletters from the other companies that include third-party ads. If you have recently opted out of receiving e-mail offers from SeatAdvisor, Inc., we will process and honor your request as soon as administratively possible. In certain circumstances, you may receive e-mail offers for SeatAdvisor, Inc. products and services during the time period when we are processing your opt-out request.</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">To opt-out of receiving offers or e-mail newsletters from other companies, follow the instructions provided by those companies.</font></div>
				<div id="contentHeader"><font id="contentHighlightFont">Ads that link to our website</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">SeatAdvisor, Inc. may use third parties to place banner ads on other websites and will perform tracking and reporting activities through use of Ad Servers. We do not provide Ad Servers with your personal information and Ad Servers do not collect your personal information. Ad Servers are subject to their own privacy policies.</font></div>
				<div id="contentHeader"><font id="contentHighlightFont">How we safeguard your information</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">SeatAdvisor, Inc. realizes how important security is to you, so we've taken a number of steps to enhance the protection of personal or confidential information sent to, or from SeatAdvisor, Inc. over the Internet. First, we require that a "secure session" be established, using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Technology. This is done any time you supply or access personal or confidential information in one of our secure online areas.</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">SSL Technology creates a private conversation that only your computer and SeatAdvisor, Inc. systems can understand. The SSL Technology encodes information as it is being sent over the Internet between your computer and SeatAdvisor, Inc. systems, helping to ensure that the transmitted information remains confidential. The use of SSL requires two components: an SSL-compatible browser and a Web server to perform the "key-exchange" that establishes a secure connection to SeatAdvisor, Inc. Web server systems. In addition, all of our secure sites require that your browser support 128-bit encryption.</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">In order to securely access your personal information via our website, you will need the latest browser version available with SSL and 128 bit encryption capabilities.</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">Second, client designated areas of the site require the use of a User ID and Password as an additional security measure that helps protect your confidential information. This allows SeatAdvisor, Inc. to verify who you are, thereby allowing you access to your account information, and preventing unauthorized access. It is the client's responsibility to maintain their user accounts and SeatAdvisor will not be held liable for any misuse of account access.</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">When a client has finished using a secure area of SeatAdvisor, Inc., make sure you always click on the "Log Out" link which appears on the top of every page. When you click on it, no further management transactions can be conducted without re-entering your User ID and Password. This also helps prevent unauthorized access to your account if you walk away from your computer.</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">You should be aware that browser software often "caches" a page as you look at it, meaning that some pages are saved in your computer's temporary memory. Therefore, you may find that clicking on your "Back" button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page. Caching in no way affects the security of your confidential User ID or Password. If you use a computer in a public place to access your account information, simply quit/exit the browser software before leaving to minimize the possibility of anyone else accessing your account.</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">Third, in order to bring you the many online products and services offered through <a href="http://www.seatadvisor.com">seatadvisor.com</a>, we work with carefully selected vendors and non-affiliated companies. If we have to share any information with these companies in order to provide a product or service to you, we first conduct a careful evaluation of their information and security systems and practices, and require administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of SeatAdvisor, Inc. client information. At any time, we may audit these companies to verify the continued security of their systems and practices.</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">Lastly, you should be aware that other Internet sites that you link to from the SeatAdvisor, Inc. site or an SeatAdvisor, Inc. e-mail may contain privacy provisions that differ from the provisions of our Privacy Statement. To ensure your privacy is protected, we recommend that you review the privacy statements of other Internet sites you visit.</font></div>
				<div id="contentHeader"><font id="contentHighlightFont">Your opt-out choices</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">We strive to send you e-mail communications that are informative and relevant, but also appreciate that you are in the best position to evaluate the type and frequency of our communications to you.</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">There are two types of e-mail communications we will send to you: service communications and marketing communications. Service communications may include information about your online registration, verification that your account has been accessed online, in response to a service related inquiry or confirmation of an online transaction. Marketing communications may include information about SeatAdvisor, Inc.'s services and products, newsletters, and joint or special offers or information from our selected non-affiliated companies and SeatAdvisor, Inc. affiliates.</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">To opt-out of receiving e-mail offers or newsletters, send us an 
				<script language="JavaScript">document.write('<a hr'+'ef="mai'+'lto'+':'+'%65%78%70%72%65%73%73%40%73%65%61%74%61%64%76%69%73%6f%72%2e%63%6f%6d">&#101;&#45;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#32;&#109;&#101;&#115;&#115;&#97;&#103;&#101;<\/a>');</script><a href="mailto:%65%78%70%72%65%73%73%40%73%65%61%74%61%64%76%69%73%6f%72%2e%63%6f%6d">e-mail message</a> requesting you be removed from our mailing list. Note: If you are a patron who wishes to opt out of a venue's e-mail marketing you must contact the client directly. You may receive separate newsletters pertaining to different SeatAdvisor, Inc. products and services that you are enrolled in automatically when you register for those products or services. In this case, you must request to be removed individually. If you opt-out, we will still send you e-mail with service updates as well as other important information related to the SeatAdvisor, Inc. online products or services for which you have signed up.</font></div>
				<div id="contentHeader"><font id="contentHighlightFont">Transaction security</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">Because SeatAdvisor Inc, is a private labeled software provider, Our clients present their event listings in a framed browser window the page may not contain the familiar security indicators including the small "lock" icon at the bottom right corner of the browser frame and the "s" in the address bar (for example, "https"). Please be assured that although these indicators are not present in the master page, the checkout component of this page is secure.</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">To verify that this page is secure and that your credit card number and personal information is being transmitted with an SSL-encrypted page, you may right click on the checkout page and view information about the page (most browsers work this way). You will see that the page is using 'https' indicating an SSL-Encrypted page.</font></div>
				<div id="contentBody"><font id="contentTextFont">Please feel free to <a href="http://www.seatadvisor.com/contact/contact.html">contact us</a> directly with questions regarding check-out security.</font></div>
