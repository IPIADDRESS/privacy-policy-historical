<p>Sears, Roebuck and Co. values the trust its customers place in the company. As an authorized licensee of Sears, Consumer Programs Incorporated (searsportrait.com) adheres to the Privacy Policies and standards of Sears. This Privacy Policy is intended to explain what searsportrait.com does with your information, and what you can expect from searsportrait.com. If you have additional questions or would like further information on this topic, please feel free to email <a href="mailto:privacy@searsportrait.com">privacy@searsportrait.com</a>.

<h2>What type of information does searsportrait.com collect and how is it used? </h2>
<p>Searsportrait.com gathers only the customer information that we need to administer our business, provide superior service and communicate offers on merchandise and services that we believe will be of interest to you. </p>
<p>There are two categories of information we may collect about you when you visit our site. The first type is personally identifiable information, such as, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card number. This type of information may be provided as part of a purchase process and allows us to process and fulfill your order and notify you of your order status.&nbsp;We also&nbsp;collect personally identifiable information&nbsp;for promotional contests,&nbsp;automatic e-mail updates, or when you choose to provide us preference information to allow us to customize your experience. Personal information will be used solely by Sears Portrait Studio or its agents for internal purposes, and will not be sold or otherwise transferred to third parties. </p>
<p>Our promotional contests require that certain fields be completed for an entry to be valid. Participation in our contests is limited to visitors age 18 or older. We invite parents to involve their children in the sweepstakes activity, but personal information required to enter the sweepstakes must be submitted by the parent or guardian only. Full name, street address, city/province, state, zip/postal code, country, e-mail address and telephone number are necessary to alert the visitor if he/she is a daily, weekly or grand prize winner. </p>
<p>Personal information is also collected when you sign up for weekly or monthly automatic e-mail messages regarding offers or announcements of new things on the web site or in our Portrait Studios. This personal information is used solely to respond to your request for automatic e-mail updates. Subscribers have the option of "un-subscribing" at any time. </p>
<p>The second category is non-personally identifiable information. Data, such as, your IP address, browser type, domain name and specific web pages through which you click, is gathered in order to gain a better understanding of site development needs. This data is collected automatically and is used&nbsp;in aggregate to help us look for trends so that we can improve our website and your user experience. </p>
