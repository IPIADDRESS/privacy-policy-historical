      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b></font></p><font color="#FFFFFF">
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Information Collection and Use</b> Incisive Media is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. 
        We will not sell, share, or rent this information to third parties in 
        ways other than those disclosed in this policy. Incisive Media        collects information from our users at several different points on our 
        website. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Registration</b> Some of our 
        sites restrict access to online content. To gain entry a user must first 
        complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to 
        give their contact information (such as name and email address). For sites 
        where online access to content is part of a subscription package, registration 
        forms will often contain full subscriber details used to identify and 
        fulfil that subscriber's account. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Email alerts</b> If a user 
        wishes to subscribe to our alerts, updates, briefings etc. we ask for 
        contact and delivery information such as name and email address. All 
        of these email lists provide opt out facilities online and with each 
        email broadcast. In some cases the user is asked to provide optional 
        demographic and personal interest information that is used to keep our 
        content as relevant as possible. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Sharing</b> We will share aggregated 
        demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not 
        linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 
        We would also share information when using an outside shipping company 
        to ship orders or a credit card processing company to bill users for goods 
        and services.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">On some sites, which generate reports 
        from directories and listings, we share the names and email addresses 
        of an individual user with some of companies whose products and services 
        are mentioned within that report. Where this occurs there is an opt out 
        provided if a user does not wish to receive any contact from those companies.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Orders</b> We request information 
        from the user on our order forms. Here a user must provide contact information 
        (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit 
        card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes 
        and to fulfil customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, 
        this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. All online 
        transactions are processed using SSL encryption (see Security for more 
        detail)</font></p>
      <p align="justify"> <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Cookies</b> Many of our sites 
        use cookies - A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive 
        containing information about the user. Usage of cookies is for the convenience 
        of visitors. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would 
        not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while 
        on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. 
        Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users 
        in order to enhance the experience on our site. Some of our business partners 
        use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no 
        access to, or control over, these cookies.</font></p>

<p align="justify"> <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Clear Gifs</b> We employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to usersâ€™ personally identifiable information. In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. All of our email newsletters provide the facility to opt-out (see opt-out section below). 



</font></p>

      <p align="justify"> <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Log Files</b> We use IP addresses 
        to analyse trends, administer the site, track a user's movement, and gather 
        broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not 
        linked to personally identifiable information. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Links</b> Some of our websites 
        contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Incisive Media       is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. This privacy 
        statement applies solely to information collected by this website. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b> From 
        time to time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. 
        Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and 
        the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. 
        Information requested may include contact information (such as name and 
        shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age 
        level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award 
        prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or 
        improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Recommend this site </b>If a 
        user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our 
        site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. We will automatically 
        send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. This 
        information is not stored except for the sole purpose of sending this 
        one-time email.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Security </b>This website takes 
        every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit 
        sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both 
        online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter 
        sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security 
        number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best 
        encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such 
        as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as 
        Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as 
        opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. While we use 
        SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything 
        in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, 
        not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our 
        offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific 
        job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) 
        are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers 
        that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure 
        environment.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"> <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Special Offers</b> On some 
        sites new members receive a welcome email to verify password and username. 
        Established members will occasionally receive information on products, 
        services, special deals, and a newsletter. Where this is the case we present 
        the option to not receive these types of communications at the point of 
        sign up. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Site and Service Updates</b> 
        We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are 
        not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important 
        information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide 
        requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account 
        via email or phone. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Correction/Updating Personal 
        Information</b> If a user's personally identifiable information changes 
        (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we 
        will endeavour to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's 
        personal data provided to us. This can be done at the registration page 
        or by emailing the site editor. Many of our sites will offer subscribers 
        an account management facility that will allow them to change or amend 
        their own records.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Choice/Opt-out</b> Our users 
        are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used 
        for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask 
        for the information. Users who no longer wish to receive a newsletter/alert/briefing 
        etc. may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to the 
        unsubscribe link in the email or online. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Notification of Changes</b> 
        If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will seek to advise all 
        users of these changes.</font></p>
