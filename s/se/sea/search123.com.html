This privacy statement is intended to disclose the privacy practices for Search123's Web site, located at <a class="copy_link" href="http://www.search123.com"> http://www.search123.com</a>, as required by our association with TRUSTe, an independent, non-profit organization with the mission of building trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting fair information practices by Web sites. -->

</span><br><br>

<span class="sub_head">Information Collection and Use</span>

<ul><p class="body_copy">
Search123 is the sole owner of the information collected on this Web site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to any third parties in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Search123 collects information from its advertisers and traffic partners (the "users") at several different points on our Web site.</p></ul>

<span class="sub_head">Registration</span>

<ul><span class="body_copy">
In order to become an advertiser or traffic partner, a user must first complete our online registration form. During registration, a user is required to give their contact information (including name and e-mail address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site. Part of the registration process requires some users to provide their Social Security or Federal Tax ID Number in order to receive payments from Search123 as part of our Traffic Partner Program.</span></ul>

<span class="sub_head">Regular Communication with Users</span>

<ul><span class="body_copy">
We routinely communicate via e-mail, mail or phone with our users.  In addition to our welcome e-mail, which confirms their username and password, we send account activity reports, low balance e-mails, funding confirmation e-mails, site and service announcement updates, and other information relating to the management of their accounts with us.  From time to time, users may receive e-mails directly from a member of our staff offering optimization or other services designed to assist the user.  Also, we often contact our users by US Mail or by telephone.  Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we will honor every request not receive these types of communications.</span></ul>

<span class="sub_head">Newsletter</span>

<ul><p class="body_copy">
Our users receive a regular newsletter from us.  If a user wishes to unsubscribe to our newsletters, he or she may do so by unsubscribing directly from our newsletter.  We do not sell, share, or rent our newsletter e-mail list.  </p></ul>

<span class="sub_head">Surveys &amp; Contests</span>

<ul><span class="body_copy">
From time-to-time, we may request information from our users via e-mail or online surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any of the requested information.  Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address), demographic information (such as zip code, age and income level), and information related to the user's experience as a Search123 advertiser or traffic partner or information related to the business of the user. Information that we gather in this way is intended to get important feedback from our users and to improve our services.  We may share this information, either specifically or in the aggregate, but no information will be attributed to any individual user without written authorization for such attribution from the user.  </span></ul>

<span class="sub_head">Credit Card Information</span>

<ul><span class="body_copy">
We request credit card information from our advertisers. As part of this process, an advertiser must provide contact information (including name and billing address) and financial information (including credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill the advertiser's requests to fund their online advertising accounts. This contact information is used to authorize the charge to their credit card and, if necessary, to contact the advertiser if we have trouble processing a request, or to otherwise address billing issues.</span></ul>

<span class="sub_head">Cookies</span>

<ul><span class="body_copy">
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.</span></ul>

<span class="sub_head">Log Files</span>

<ul><span class="body_copy">
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</span></ul>

<span class="sub_head">Sharing</span>

<ul><span class="body_copy">
We will share aggregated demographic information with our traffic partners and advertisers from time to time. The information that we may share is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual user.  We use an outside credit card processing company to process the credit cards of our users.  This company has advised us that they do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any purpose other than processing transactions on our behalf.  We may partner with other parties to provide other specific services related to the services that we provide for our users.  In such instances, we may be required to share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party service provider to provide these services.  These parties will not  be allowed to use personally identifiable information related to our users  except for the purpose of providing these services.</span></ul>

<span class="sub_head">Links to Other Sites</span>

<ul><span class="body_copy">
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be advised that Search123 is not responsible for the privacy practices of any other sites that link to or from Search123. We encourage our users to be aware that privacy policies may differ when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</span></ul>

<span class="sub_head">Security</span>

<ul><span class="body_copy">
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and offline.  Sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and e-mail addresses) is encrypted using SSL.  While on a secure page, such as all of the pages within our account management interface, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape NavigatorÒ and Microsoft Internet ExplorerÒ becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just "surfing." To learn more about SSL, click <a href="http://developer.netscape.com/tech/security/ssl/howitworks.html" class="copy_link" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user information offline. All information related to our users is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific function (for example, our billing services manager or a client services representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All our databases are accessible only through password-protected interfaces and we require all those with access to this information to use password-protected screen-savers.   <br><br>
Furthermore, all employees are routinely advised of our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure the integrity of our users' personal information.  Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage, at a third party hosting facility.
</span></ul>

<span class="sub_head">Corrections/Updating Personal Information</span>

<ul><span class="body_copy">
If our users' personally identifiable information changes, or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data. This can be done at the "Account Info" page within the "Admin" section of our Account Management interface or by e-mailing Client Services at us at <a href="mailto:privacy@search123.com">privacy@search123.com</a>. </span></ul>

<span class="sub_head">Notification of Changes</span>

<ul><span class="body_copy">
We have the right to change our privacy policy at any time.  If we do so, we will post those changes in this section of our Web site so that our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose such information.<br><br>
If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.  </span></ul>

<br><br><br><br>
<span class="strong_body_copy">If you require further information regarding the above policies, or would like to request that you cease receiving any particular form of communication from us, please contact us by e-mail at <a class="copy_link" href="mailto:privacy@search123.com">privacy@search123.com</a>.</span>
