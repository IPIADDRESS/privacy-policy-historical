                            <p>As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience for all recipients we may use log files, web beacons and cookies to collect data from browsers, advertiser and third party sites (?Sites?) to aggregate Information. The Information collected is used for marketing purposes, enables us to determine which advertisements perform well, allows us to more effectively match advertisements and website content to your interests, assists us in improving the operation of our services, helps us to maintain the quality of our services, enhances our services to our business partners and clients and enables us to provide general statistics to our business partners and clients regarding use of Search 123services.</p>
                            <p>?Log files? track actions occurring on Sites and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, click data and types of advertisements viewed.</p>
                            <p>?Image requests? or ?web beacons? can transmit information used to track your data, which may include the navigation of a website or collection of sites, the completion of transactions, submittal of applications and browsing behaviour. This information is written to cookies.</p>
                            <p>"Cookies" are files (e.g. HTTP cookies) that are stored on your Internet enabled device (which includes your computer, BlackBerry or other PDA). Cookies are used to improve the experience web users have when they see web advertisements and ensure that when a web user clicks on an advertisement, they are sent to the correct click-through destination. We may use Cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display. This allows advertisers to determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach. Cookies are also used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser, and to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement.</p>
                            <p>There are two classes of Cookies based on how long they remain on your system: (i) ?Session Cookies? are used only during your visit to the Sites and are erased once you close your browser, and (ii) ?Persistent Cookies? remain on your browser for 2 years from your last visit to the Sites and enable us to remember you on subsequent visits to the Sites and provide more relevant content to you on such Sites.</p>
                            <p>There are many misconceptions about Cookies, some of which we will try to address in this policy.

                            <h3>Security.</h3>
                            <p>Search123 employs appropriate measures to ensure the security of all Information and we routinely evaluate our practices to identify security threats or opportunities for the improvement of our services. No transmission of information is guaranteed to be completely secure. Unauthorised entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise data security. You acknowledge and agree to assume this risk when communicating with us.</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>If a Member no longer desires our service we provide two ways to remove that Member's personal data from being live in our system.  All requests to remove a Member from our system will be verified prior to removal to insure the proper identity of the requester.<br>

                            <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on the first page a Member views after successful login so our Members are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify Members by way of an email. Members will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. </p>
