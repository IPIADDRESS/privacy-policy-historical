      <p>Your privacy is important to Citibank. This is why, as a member of Citigroup, 
        we are committed to the Citigroup Privacy Promise for Consumers, which 
        is as follows: <br>
        <br>
        <b><span class="subhdrTxt">Citigroup Privacy Promise for Consumers</span></b> 
      </p><p>While information is the cornerstone of our ability to provide superior 
        service, our most important asset is our customers' trust. Keeping customer 
        information secure, and using it only as our customers would want us to, 
        is a top priority for all of us at Citibank as a member of the Citigroup 
        family of companies. Here then, is our promise to our individual customers:<br>
        <br>
      </p><ol>
        <li>We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security and confidentiality, 
          any information our customers share with us. <br>
        </li><li>We will limit the collection and use of customer information to the 
          minimum we require to deliver superior service to our customers, which 
          includes advising our customers about our products, services and other 
          opportunities, and to administer our business. <br>
        </li><li>We will permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper 
          handling of customer information, to have access to that information. 
          Employees who violate our Privacy Promise will be subject to our normal 
          disciplinary process. <br>
        </li><li>We will not reveal customer information to any external organization 
          unless we have previously informed the customer in disclosures or agreements, 
          been authorized by the customer, or are required by law or our regulators. <br>
        </li><li>We will always maintain control over the confidentiality of our customer 
          information. We may, however, facilitate relevant offers from reputable 
          companies. These companies are not permitted to retain any customer 
          information unless the customer has specifically expressed interest 
          in their products or services. <br>
        </li><li>We will tell customers in plain language initially, and at least once 
          annually, how they may remove their names from marketing lists. At any 
          time, customers can contact us to remove their names from such lists. 
          <br>
        </li><li>Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, 
          we will require them to conform to our policy standards and to allow 
          us to audit them for compliance. <br>
        </li><li>For purposes of credit reporting, verification and risk management, 
          we will exchange information about our customers with reputable reference 
          sources and clearinghouse services. <br>
        </li><li>We will not use or share – internally or externally – personally 
          identifiable medical information for any purpose other than the underwriting 
          or administration of a customer's policy, claim or account, or as disclosed 
          to the customer when the information is collected, or to which the customer 
          consents. <br>
        </li><li>We will attempt to keep customer files complete, up to date, and accurate. 
          We will tell our customers how and where to conveniently access their 
          account information (except when we're prohibited by law), and how to 
          notify us about errors which we will promptly correct.
