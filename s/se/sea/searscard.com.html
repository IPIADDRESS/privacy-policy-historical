		 <strong><span id="internetPrivacyP4">1. What Information Do We Collect? </span></strong><br><br>
		 <span id="internetPrivacyP5">We collect two types of online information: non-personal and personal.</span><br><br>
		 
		 <strong><span id="nonpersonalInfoP">Non-Personal Information</span></strong><br><br>
		 <span id="nonpersonalInfoP1">When you visit our site, we collect the <a href="# " onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">IP address</a> of the device you use to connect to the Internet. In addition, we gather information such as what browser and which version of it you're using, the type of operating system you have, and which site you came from. This information helps us provide an online experience that matches your device.</span><br><br> 
		 <span id="nonpersonalInfoP2">When you browse our site or receive one of our emails, Citi and <a href="# " onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">companies we work with</a>, use <a href="# " onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">cookies</a> and/or <a href="# " onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">pixel tags</a> to collect information and store your online preferences. <a href="# " onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">Cookies</a> are widely used and most browsers are set up to accept them automatically. If you would prefer, you can choose to <a href="#anchor4 ">not accept cookies</a>.</span><br><br>
		 <span id="nonpersonalInfoP3">It's important to note that <a href="# " onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">cookies</a> and <a href="# " onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">pixel tags</a> do not capture any information that can personally identify you. The information they gather helps us improve your online experience and may include:</span> 
		   <ul>
	       	<li><span id="nonpersonalInfoL1">Your response to one of our emails</span></li>
	        <li><span id="nonpersonalInfoL2">Time and duration of your visit to our site</span></li>
	        <li><span id="nonpersonalInfoL3">Pages you viewed while on our site</span></li>
	       </ul>
		 <span id="nonpersonalInfoP4">We may also supplement the information we collect with information we receive from other companies. For example, we may use <a href="# " onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">marketing segments</a> developed by us or other companies to customize certain services to your local area and provide relevant Citi offers tailored to you.</span><br><br>
		 
		 <strong><span id="personalInfoP">Personal Information</span></strong><br><br>
		 <span id="personalInfoP1">In addition to the information described in the previous section, we may also gather personal information that you provide to us such as your name, address, phone number, and email. Collecting this personal information enables us to offer you online experiences that help you with your financial needs. For example, we collect personal information when you are:</span>
		   <ul>
	       	<li><span id="personalInfoL1">Banking online</span></li>
	        <li><span id="personalInfoL2">Applying for a new program or account</span></li>
	       </ul>
		 <span id="personalInfoP2">If you've enrolled in Citi services, such as online bill payment, we collect personal information about your transactions, and how you interact with third parties such as those you pay like a utility company or phone company. Collecting this information enables us to provide you these services. You can refer to the terms and conditions for your account or service to learn how your information is collected and used.</span><br><br>
		 <span id="personalInfoP3">If we have personal information from you, or information that's publicly available from other sources, we may use it in combination with the information that Citi has collected online.  We can use this information to better tailor and personalize our service and marketing communications with you, both online and offline.</span><br><br>
		 <span id="personalInfoP4">The personal information you provide online is held by the Citi business that maintains your account or is processing your application for a new product or service.  You can access and/or change information in connection with your account or application by logging on to your account online or telephoning customer service.  </span><br><br>
		 <span id="personalInfoP5">Please see the <a href="/us/cards/BrandPrivacyNotice.pdf">Privacy Notice</a>, which we provide to all our customers, for a comprehensive explanation of how we collect, use and share personal information and what you can do to limit the use and sharing of your information.  If you have a retail store or gas card issued by Citibank, N.A., you may call the number that appears on the Privacy Statement you receive.  All customers may also call Customer Service at any time with questions or to make privacy choices.</span><br><br>

		 <strong><span id="useInfoP">2. How Do We Use the Information We Collect?</span></strong><br><br>
		 <span id="useInfoP1">Citi uses the information we collect about and from you to manage our business and to offer an enhanced, personalized online experience on our site and <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">third-party websites</a>.</span><br><br>
		 <span id="useInfoP2">The information we collect allows us to:</span><br><br>
		   <ul>
	       	<li><span id="useInfoL1">Recognize you when you return to our site so we can personalize your experience</span></li>
	        <li><span id="useInfoL2">Process applications and transactions</span></li>
	        <li><span id="useInfoL3">Respond to your requests</span></li>
	        <li><span id="useInfoL4">Provide you relevant product and service offers on our site and in other advertising</span></li>
	       </ul>
	     
	     <a name="anchor3"></a>  
	     <strong><span id="adInfoP">3. How Do We Use Information from Our Advertisements on Other Websites?</span></strong><br><br>
	     <span id="adInfoP1"><a href="# " onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">Companies we work with</a> place and track advertisements on <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">third-party websites</a>. </span><br><br>
		 <span id="adInfoP2">Like most advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to customers.  We place advertisements by developing and using our own <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">marketing segments</a> that may combine online and offline information about our current and prospective customers.  In addition, we may use <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">marketing segments</a> provided by online publishers and network advertising companies.</span><br><br>
		 <span id="adInfoP3">Network advertising companies that provide these services have their own privacy policies and are not subject to our Online Privacy Statement. Many of these companies provide ways to <a href="#anchor4">avoid targeted advertising</a> provided by, or thru, them.</span><br><br>
		 
		 <a name="anchor4"></a>
		 <strong><span id="controlInfoP">4. Can You Control Your Information That's Collected and Used Online?</span></strong><br><br>
		 <span id="controlInfoP1">It's important to note that the information we use about you helps us provide you with products, services and experiences that benefit you. You have the ability to control how your non-personal information is collected and used online.</span><br><br>
		 <strong><span id="controlInfoP2">Cookies</span></strong><br><br>
		 <span id="controlInfoP3">You can control whether to accept <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">cookies</a> or not.  If you decide to not accept <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">cookies</a>, some features and services on our site may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your Citi account(s). In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.</span><br><br>
		 <span id="controlInfoP4">If you would prefer not to accept <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">cookies</a>, you can: </span><br><br>
		   <ul>
	       	<li><span id="controlInfoL1">Change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">cookie</a>, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it</span></li>
	        <li><span id="controlInfoL2">Set your browser to automatically not accept any <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">cookies</a> </span></li>
	       </ul>
	     <strong><span id="controlInfoP5">Targeted Advertising </span></strong><br><br>
	     <span id="controlInfoP6">If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information.  To do so please visit the <a href="/us/cards/opt_out.htm" target="_blank">NAI Opt-Out Page</a>. Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests.</span><br><br>
	     <span id="controlInfoP7">Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive.  The <a href="/us/cards/opt_out.htm" target="_blank">NAI Opt-Out Page</a> provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">cookies</a> on your browser and provides links to those companies. </span><br><br>
	     
	     <span id="internetPrivacyP6">From time to time, we may change this Online Privacy Policy. The effective date of this policy, as stated below, indicates the last time this policy was revised or materially changed. Checking the effective date below allows you to determine whether there have been changes since the last time you reviewed the policy.</span><br><br>
