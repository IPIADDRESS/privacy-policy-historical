<br>
Insufficient content: Your pages need to have enough text on them for our specialists to review and to be able to determine what your pages are about.<br>
<br>

<h6>To resolve this issue, please work through the following suggestions:</h6><br>
<br>
- Make sure that your pages have sufficient text - websites that contain mostly images, videos or Flash animations will not be approved.<br>
<br>
- Your content should contain complete sentences and paragraphs, not only headlines.<br>
<br>
- Ensure that your website is fully built - do not publish while your site’s still in a beta or "under construction” phase or only consists of a website template.<br>
<br>
- Provide a clear navigation system for your visitors so that they can easily find all of the sections and pages of your website.<br>
<br>
As soon as you've made the necessary changes, we’ll be happy to take another look at your account.<br>
