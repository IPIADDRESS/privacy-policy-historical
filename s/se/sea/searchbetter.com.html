<div>We use the information that we collect to facilitate the delivery of relevant and/or targeted search results, improve the overall quality of your experience with the Site and Site Services, and to facilitate evaluation, improvement, and development of the Site Services. We aggregate query information for internal reporting purposes and optimization of advertising revenue.

<p>Information about the search queries you submit to the Site and how you interact with search results may also be used to personalize the content and advertisements that we present to you. We may, based on the search queries you submit and the search results you select (including paid search results), draw inferences about your interests and display advertisements matched to such interests. You may receive such customized ads on the Site and on third-party sites (see also "<a href="#infoshared">What information do we share with third parties?</a>" below). If you would like to terminate and Site's access to your search history you may remove our cookies from your computer (see "<a href="#cookieused">How are cookies used on the Site?</a>" below and consult your browser's "help" menu to learn how to delete cookies).</p>

Cookies are a standard Internet technology that allows us to store and retrieve information on a user's system. To understand more about cookies click <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">here</a>. Our web server automatically asks a new user's browser whether it will accept our cookie file. If the user's browser accepts our cookie, our web server will record the cookie's unique ID for our use in internal reporting and for customized advertising (see "<a href="#datause">How may we use the information we collect?</a>" above).

<p id="infoshared"><b>What information may we share with third parties?</b></p>
<div>We do not share your name name, or email address or any other personal information with third parties for the purpose of enabling them to send you information about their products or services (or for any other purpose, except to respond to <a href="#law">legal process</a> as described below).</div>
<p><i>Third-party service providers. </i>Some elements or features of the Site, such as the sponsored results advertising on our Site pages, are supplied to us by third parties under contract. We may supply some of the information we collect from you to those third parties so that they can provide those elements or features for display on the Site.

For example, when you submit a query, we transmit it (and some of the related information described above) to our paid-listing providers in order to generate relevant advertising to display in response to your query and to optimize the number and quality of sponsored results that will be provided to you on the Site. We may merge information about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers. If you provide us with answers to voluntary survey questions, we may furnish this information to our advertisers and partners in the form of group statistics compiled from our users' answers to such questions.</p>
<p><i>Search Partners. </i>If you have accessed the Site through an APN or third party application installed on your computer or mobile device, then our search partners that developed or distributed the search application may collect information about you including the queries you submit via our Site, the search application or your browser, as well as the search results and ads you click on and the address of the web pages you previously listed. </p>
<p>We have agreements in place with our search partners and our third-party service providers that limits their use and disclosure of any information about you that you provide directly to us (i.e., information not provided directly by you to the applicable search partner or third-party service providers.</p>

We also may disclose such information in compliance with a law-enforcement or other governmental request, or where we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a>.  </p>
<p><i>Corporate restructuring. </i>We also may transfer your information to a third party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger, or other transfer of assets).</p>
<p id="leavesite"><b>What happens when you leave the Site to go to other Internet sites?</b></p>
<div>We do not control the information collection and dissemination policies of third-party companies. When you are on the Site, you may be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. For example, if you click on a search result, the click may take you to a third-party website. These other sites may independently collect data from or about you, solicit information from you, or place their own cookies on your computer. We are not responsible for any use of the information such third-party sites may collect. </div>
<p>We also offer you access to "co-branded" services that are jointly provided by us and selected companies. In many cases, these co-branded services will contain the Site branding, but might not be hosted by us. You may notice that you are on a co-branded site if the pages say "provided by SearchBetter" and/or if our standard branding is  otherwise displayed on the page. In such cases, you should click on the privacy link on the page to determine which company's privacy policy applies to the information you enter on the page. Even if the page is governed by a separate privacy policy, we might be entitled to receive information about you when using that service. If you elect to provide registration information when using a co-branded service, the information you provide may be shared and/or retained by the provider of that service in accordance with its own privacy policy and terms of service. </p>
<p>We encourage you to consult the privacy policies of such other companies and to contact them directly if you have any questions about their use of your information. </p>
<p id="below13"><b>What is our policy regarding personally identifiable information from children under 13?</b></p>
<div>We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we determine that a user is under 13, we will immediately delete all information pertaining to that user. </div>
<p id="precautions"><b>Do we take security precautions to protect your information? </b></p>
<div>We have security measures in place that are designed to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access to information we collect online. We utilize both industry and proprietary standards to preserve the confidentiality of information. We seek to limit access to our users' information to employees who we believe reasonably need access to that information to provide products or services to you or in order to perform their jobs. These employees have been informed of the need to maintain the security and confidentiality of such information. Unfortunately, no security system can be 100% secure; accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that we collect online.</div>
<p id="considerations"><b>Are there special considerations if you are visiting the Site from outside of the United States?</b></p>
<div>If you are visiting the Site from outside of the United States, your information will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data-protection and other laws in the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your own country. Please be assured, however, that we seek to take reasonable steps to protect your privacy. By using the Site Services, you consent to the transfer of your information to our facilities and those third parties with whom we may share it as described in this Privacy Policy.</div>
