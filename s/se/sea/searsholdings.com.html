The Sears Holdings family of businesses includes all Sears Holdings affiliates, as well as other selected third party businesses with which Sears Holdings or its affiliates have a relationship and which have agreed to appropriate restrictions on the disclosure and use of your information.

<h4>How Do We Handle Personally Identifiable Information Collected from Children?</h4>

<p>This Site is a general audience site and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. In the event a Sears Holdings Site or portion thereof is directed to children under 13, the Site will contain a Children's Online Privacy Policy that complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.</p>

<h4>What About Links to Other Sites?</h4>

<p>This Site may contain links to other Sites that are not owned and operated by Sears Holdings. Sears Holdings is not responsible for the privacy practices of non-affiliated Sites. You should read the privacy statements of each and every Site that collects PII.</p>

<h4>Interest-Based Ads – Online Advertisements</h4>

<p>This Site may display ads from other companies. We also partner with third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf on other non-affiliated third party Sites. Some of the ads on this Site or on third party Sites may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on what we or the online advertising network serving the ad know about you or your computer's browsing activity. For example, anonymous information collected across multiple Sites that you visit may enable the ad network to predict your preferences and show you ads that are most likely to be of interest to you. Please note that we do not share any information that identifies you personally with the third party service providers who serve ads on our behalf.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you do not wish to receive personalized advertising from us on other Sites, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out</a>&nbsp;page. To learn more about interest based advertising and to manage your preferences for Sears and Kmart branded online ads, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sears.com/trusteprivacy/dap-120000000391831">Sears Online Advertising Preference Center</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kmart.com/trusteprivacy/dap-120000000391830">Kmart Online Advertising Preference Center</a>.<br>
<br>
The Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about internet advertising companies, including information about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by their members. See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>&nbsp;for general information about the NAI. You may also visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/">http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/</a>&nbsp;to learn about online behavioral advertising and how to opt-out from online behavioral ads served by some or all participating companies.&nbsp;<br>
If you delete your cookies, use another computer or device, or change browsers, you will need to repeat this process. In addition, opting out of interest-based ads will not opt you out of all ads, but rather only those ads that are personalized to your interests based on activities observed on web sites or mobile apps not owned and operated by Sears Holdings.</p>

<h4>Is My Information Secure?</h4>

<p>We maintain reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your PII. While we do work very hard to protect your privacy, no method of security is 100% effective, and we cannot be responsible for the actions of those who may gain unauthorized access to your PII. Sears Holdings makes no warranties, express, implied or otherwise, as to the ultimate effectiveness of its reasonable and appropriate safeguards.</p>
