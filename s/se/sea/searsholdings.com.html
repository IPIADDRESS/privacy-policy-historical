  <br>
  We use single sign-on services that allow you to sign into this Site using your  third-party social networking login credentials for accounts such as Facebook,  Google or Twitter. This allows you to link your existing social network profile  to your Site account. Once connected, you will be able to post content on the  third-party web site from this Site and interact with your friends from the  third-party site(s). Any information or content that you post to the  third-party site will be subject to that site’s own privacy policy. This Site  may also access and use available information from your third-party social  network profile, such as your name, location, profile picture and information,  gender, list of friends, friends’ profiles or postings, email address, wall  postings and news feed. <br>
  <br>
  We  may use your PII to allow you to send messages to a  friend through this Site. By using this functionality, you are telling us that  you are entitled to use and provide us with your friend’s name and email  address. </p>

  <br>
  Some Site features may make use of your device attributes and settings that  will allow our Site to determine your physical location. Such technologies may  include IP address mapping, WiFi, GPS signals, cell tower positioning or other  technologies. We use this information to enhance and personalize your  experience and provide you with offers and services that may be of interest to  you. For example, this Site may help you find your closest store or send you  messages that may be of interest to you based on your current location. Sears  Holdings has no control over your device settings, but we do recommend enabling  location services on your device so you can take advantage of the location  based features and functionality offered by this Site.  <br>
  Non-PII  may be collected from you by means of cookies and pixel tags. Cookies are small  bits of information that this Site places on your computer. We and our third  party service providers use various types of cookies, local shared objects and  pixel tags to identify your IP address, browser type, device characteristics,  domain name, referring urls and specific links and web pages through which you  click. This data is collected automatically and utilized for site operations,  fraud prevention and to help us improve this Site and your overall experience.  This technology  also allows us to  recognize you when you return to this Site and to provide you with a customized  experience that we feel will be of value to you.    We may use and disclose non-PII in any  manner for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under  applicable law.<br>
</p>
<h4>What Information Do We Share and with Whom? </h4>
<p>We  may share your PII with members of the Sears Holdings family of businesses to  provide you with products or services that you have requested, to provide you  with promotional offers we believe will be of interest to you and for any other  purpose described in this Privacy Policy. The Sears Holdings family of businesses  includes all Sears Holdings affiliates, as well as other selected third party businesses  with which Sears Holdings or its affiliates have a relationship and which have  agreed to appropriate restrictions on the disclosure and use of your  information.  We do not rent or sell your  PII to marketers outside the Sears Holdings family of businesses, unless you  authorize us to do so. <br>
  Sears  Holdings may make third party applications available to you on our Sites and  you may choose to authorize us to share your information with the application  and its publisher. We require third parties who publish applications on our Sites  to give you notice of their own privacy policy, which you should review prior  to authorizing the application to access your information. <br>
  We  may disclose your PII to identify you to anyone to whom you send messages  through this Site. You may disclose your own PII on message boards, chat,  profile pages, blogs and other social networking features and services to which  you are able to post information and materials. Please note that any  information you post or disclose through these services may be available to Site  visitors and to the general public, depending on the particular service and any  privacy settings in place (such as through your profile). Be careful when  deciding to disclose your PII, your location or any other information, on this  Site.<br>
  <br>
  In certain circumstances, we may share your PII with service providers that  need access to your information to provide operational or other support  services, such as credit card processors or shipping agents. Our service  providers must agree to appropriate restrictions on the disclosure and use of  your information. Unless otherwise disclosed to you, our service providers are  prohibited from using your PII for their own marketing purposes.  <br>
  <br>
  We may provide information about you, which may include PII, to regulatory  authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law,  when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it or to respond  to requests from government authorities. There may be instances when we may use  or disclose your PII in order to protect or defend the legal rights, property  or operations of Sears Holdings or our employees or agents; to protect the rights,  privacy, safety or security of users, members or others; to protect against  fraud; and to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that  we may sustain. <br>
  Sears  Holdings may sell, transfer and/or share PII with third parties in connection  with a merger, reorganization, joint venture, assignment, spin-off, transfer or  sale or disposition of all or any portion of our business, and in the event of  a store closing or bankruptcy.<br>
</p>
<h4>Can I Disable Cookies? </h4>
<p>Most  web browsers allow you to exercise control over cookie files on your computer  by erasing them, blocking them, or notifying you when such a file is stored.  Please take a look at your particular browser for instructions on this  function.  <br>
  We may also use Flash Cookies, LSOs  and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information  about your use of the Services, fraud prevention and other site operations.   If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your  computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO  storage using the tools contained in the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" title="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Website  Storage Settings Panel</a>. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html" title="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">Global  Storage Settings Panel</a> and following the instructions (which may include  instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs  (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent  Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and  (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being  delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).  Please note that setting the Flash Player to  restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the  functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash  applications used in connection with the Services or our online content.  <br>
  If  you do elect to disable cookies, please note that you may not be able to take  full advantage of a personalized experience on this Site and on other Sears  Holdings Sites.<br>
</p>
<h4>How Do We Handle Personally Identifiable  Information Collected from Children? </h4>
<p>This  Site is a general audience site and we do not knowingly collect personal  information from children under 13 years of age. In the event a Sears Holdings Site  or portion thereof is directed to children under 13, the Site will contain a  Children's Online Privacy Policy that complies with the Children’s Online  Privacy Protection Act.<br>
</p>
<h4>What About Links to Other Sites? </h4>
<p>This  Site may contain links to other Sites that are not owned and operated by Sears  Holdings. Sears Holdings is not responsible for the privacy practices of  non-affiliated Sites. You should read the privacy statements of each and every Site  that collects PII.<br>
</p>
<h4>Interest-Based Ads – Online Advertisements</h4>
This Site may display ads from other companies. We also partner with  third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf on other non-affiliated  third party Sites. Some of the ads on this Site or on third party Sites may be  personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on  what we or the online advertising network serving the ad know about you or your  computer's browsing activity. For example, anonymous information collected  across multiple Sites that you visit may enable the ad network to predict your  preferences and show you ads that are most likely to be of interest to you. Please  note that we do not share any information that identifies you personally with  the third party service providers who serve ads on our behalf. <br>
<br>
If  you do not wish to receive personalized advertising from us on other Sites,  please visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out</a> page.    To learn more about interest based  advertising and to manage your preferences for Sears and Kmart branded online  ads, please visit the <a href="http://www.sears.com/trusteprivacy/dap-120000000391831">Sears Online Advertising Preference Center</a> or  the <a href="http://www.kmart.com/trusteprivacy/dap-120000000391830">Kmart Online Advertising Preference Center</a>.<br>
<br>
The Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about internet  advertising companies, including information about how to opt-out of  interest-based advertising by their members. See <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a> for general information about the NAI. You may also visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/">http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/</a> to learn about online behavioral advertising and how to opt-out from online  behavioral ads served by some or all participating companies. <br>
If  you delete your cookies, use another computer or device, or change browsers,  you will need to repeat this process. In addition, opting out of interest-based  ads will not opt you out of all ads, but rather only those ads that are  personalized to your interests based on activities observed on web sites or  mobile apps not owned and operated by Sears Holdings.<strong> </strong>
<h4>Is My Information Secure? </h4>
<p>We  maintain reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic and procedural  safeguards to protect your PII. While we do work very hard to protect your  privacy, no method of security is 100% effective, and we cannot be responsible  for the actions of those who may gain unauthorized access to your PII. Sears  Holdings makes no warranties, express, implied or otherwise, as to the ultimate  effectiveness of its reasonable and appropriate safeguards. </p>
<h4>How Can I Access My Information? </h4>
<p>You  can personalize your experience on this Site and other Sears Holdings Sites by  becoming a Registered User or Member. By registering, you will be able to tell  us what products and services interest you, and whether you wish to receive information  about special sales, promotions and other events. Once registered, you can submit,  review and maintain your account profile information at any time by accessing  your profile from within the particular Site. Your account information is  accessible by using a password that you select or by using third-party social  networking login credentials for accounts such as Facebook, Google or Twitter  if you choose to enable this feature. <strong></strong></p>
<h4>Can I "Opt-Out" of Receiving  Promotional E-mails? </h4>
<p>From  time to time, we may send you e-mails with promotional offers and messages. If  you would no longer like to receive e-mails with promotional offers and messages  from this Site, you can unsubscribe from these e-mails by following the  unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each promotional e-mail. Please note  that you may still receive transactional or relationship or other  non-promotional e-mails (e.g., order confirmations, shipping notices,  statements, important information regarding a product you have purchased, etc.).<strong></strong></p>
<h4>Where Is My Information Stored? </h4>
<p>Your PII may be stored  and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage  service providers, and by using our Site,<strong> </strong>you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your  country of residence, including the United States, which may have different  data protection rules than in your country. This Site is controlled and  operated by us from the United States and is not intended to subject us to the  laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the  United States. <strong></strong></p>
<h4>How May I Contact You? </h4>
If you have any  questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@customerservice.sears.com">webmaster@customerservice.sears.com</a>. Because email communications are not always  secure, please do not include credit card or other financial information, health  or prescription-related information or other sensitive information in your  email to us.
