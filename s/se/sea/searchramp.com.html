feature does</strong></p><p>           Activation reduces software counterfeiting, which helps ensure that Microsoft customers receive the software quality they expect. Once your software is activated, a specific product key becomes associated with the PC (or the hardware) on which your software is installed. This association prevents the product key from being used to activate the same copy of the software on multiple PCs. Some changes to your PC hardware or software might require you to reactivate Windows. Activation can detect and disable activation exploits (software that circumvents or bypasses Microsoft software activation). If an activation exploit is present, a software or hardware vendor might have tampered with genuine Microsoft software in order to create counterfeit copies of the software. Activation exploits may interfere with the normal operation of your system.</p><p><strong>Information collected, processed, or transmitted</strong></p><p>           During activation, the following info is sent to Microsoft:         </p><ul><li><p>               The Microsoft product code (a five-digit code that identifies the Windows product you're activating).             </p></li><li><p>A channel ID or site code that identifies how the Windows product was originally obtained. For example, a channel ID or site code identifies whether the product was originally purchased from a retail store, obtained as an evaluation copy, obtained through a volume licensing program, or pre-installed by a PC manufacturer.</p></li><li><p>The date of installation, and whether the installation was successful.               </p></li><li><p> Information that helps confirm that your Windows product key hasn't been altered.</p></li><li><p>PC make and model.</p></li><li><p>Version information for the operating system and software.</p></li><li><p>Region and language settings.</p></li><li><p>A unique number called a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) assigned to your PC.</p></li><li><p>Product Key (hashed) and Product ID.</p></li><li><p>BIOS name, revision number, and revision date.</p></li><li><p>Hard drive volume serial number (hashed).</p></li><li><p>The result of the activation check. This includes error codes and information about any activation exploits and related malicious or unauthorized software found or disabled:</p><ul><li><p>The activation exploit's identifier.</p></li><li><p>The activation exploit's current state, such as cleaned or quarantined.</p></li><li><p>PC manufacturer's identification.</p></li><li><p>The activation exploit's file name and hash, as well as a hash of related software components that may indicate the presence of an activation exploit.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The name and a hash of the contents of your PC's start-up instructions file. If your Windows license is on a subscription basis, information will also be sent about how your subscription works. Standard computer information is sent as well. </p></li><li><p>If you’re using a volume licensed copy of Windows that uses an activation server, the IP address of that server may be sent to Microsoft.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Use of information</strong></p><p>           Microsoft uses the information to confirm that you have a licensed copy of the software. Microsoft doesn't use the information to contact individual consumers. License server information is used to ensure that license servers comply with their license agreements.</p><p><strong>Choice and control</strong></p><p>           Activation is required and occurs automatically while you set up Windows.

Owners of digital information can define how recipients use the information contained in a file, such as who can open, modify, print, or take other actions with the file. In order to create or view a file with restricted permissions, your PC must be running an AD RMS enabled app and have access to an AD RMS server.</p><p><strong>Information collected, processed, or transmitted</strong></p><p>           AD RMS uses your email address to identify you to an AD RMS server. As a result, your email address is stored on the server, and on your PC in licenses and identity certificates created by the server. Identity certificates and licenses are transferred to and from AD RMS servers when you attempt to open, print, or perform other actions on a document protected by rights management. If your PC is connected to an enterprise network, the AD RMS server is typically operated by the enterprise. If you're using Windows Live AD RMS services, the server is operated by Microsoft. To help protect your privacy, information that is sent to Microsoft AD RMS servers is encrypted.</p><p><strong>Use of information</strong></p><p>           The license allows you to access protected files. The identity certificates are used to identify you to an AD RMS server, and allow you to protect files and to access protected files.         </p><p><strong>Choice and control</strong></p><p>           AD RMS features must be enabled through an AD RMS-capable app. By default, they aren’t enabled. You can choose to not enable or use them. However, if you don’t enable them, you won’t be able to access protected files.         </p><p><a href="#TopOfPageTarget ">Top of Page</a></p></div><div class="m-b-bl" id="advertising"><h2 class="section-heading ">Advertising  ID</h2><p><strong>What this feature does</strong></p><p>To provide more relevant advertising, Windows allows apps to access a unique identifier for each user on a device. You can reset or turn off access to this identifier at any time.</p><p><strong>Information collected, processed, or transmitted </strong></p><p>If you allow apps access to the advertising ID, Windows will provide it to all apps that request it. Apps might store or transmit this information.</p><p><strong>             Use of information           </strong></p><p>Your advertising ID is used by app developers and advertising networks to provide more relevant advertising to you by understanding which apps you use and how you use them. It can also be used by app developers to improve quality of service by allowing them to determine the frequency and effectiveness of ads and to detect fraud and security issues.</p><p>If you allow apps to access the advertising ID, each app’s use of the identifier is subject to that app’s privacy practices. </p><p><strong>Choice and control</strong></p><p>If you choose express settings while setting up Windows, Windows will allow apps to use your advertising ID. If you choose to customize settings, you can control access to your advertising ID by selecting <strong>Let apps use my advertising ID for experiences across apps</strong> under <strong>Share info with Microsoft and other services</strong>. After setting up Windows, you can change this setting in <strong>Privacy</strong> in PC settings. If you turn this setting off, the advertising ID is not sent to apps that request it. If you choose to turn the setting on again, a new identifier will be generated.</p><p><a href="#TopOfPageTarget ">Top of Page</a></p></div><div class="m-b-bl" id="audit"><h2 class="section-heading ">Audit</h2><p>           Audit allows an administrator to configure Windows to record operating system activity in a security log that can be accessed using the Event Viewer and other apps. This log can help an administrator detect unauthorized access to the PC or resources on the PC. For example, this log can help administrators troubleshoot problems and determine whether someone has signed in to the PC, created a new user account, changed a security policy, or opened a document.         </p><p><strong>Information collected, processed, or transmitted</strong></p><p>           Administrators determine what information is collected, how long it is retained, and whether it is transmitted to other parties. The information might include personal information, such as user names or file names. For more information, contact your administrator.         No information is sent to Microsoft.</p><p><strong>Use of information</strong></p><p>           Administrators also determine how the audit information is used.

When BitLocker is enabled on a supported drive, Windows encrypts the data on the drive.</p><p><strong>Information collected, processed, or transmitted</strong></p><p>           When BitLocker is enabled using software encryption, cryptographic keys in memory continually encrypt and decrypt data as it is read from or written to the protected drive. When BitLocker is enabled using hardware encryption, data encryption and decryption is performed by the drive.         </p><p>           During BitLocker setup, you can choose to print a recovery key or save it to a location on your network. If you set up BitLocker on a non-removable drive, you can also save your recovery key to a USB flash drive.         </p><p>           If your PC isn't joined to a domain, you can back up your BitLocker recovery key, recovery key ID, and computer name to MicrosoftOneDrive. To help protect your privacy, the information is sent encrypted via SSL.         </p><p>You can set up BitLocker to encrypt data using a certificate stored on a smart card. When you protect a data drive using a smart card, the public key and unique identifier for the smart card are stored unencrypted on the drive.

Windows location services consist of two components. Windows Location Provider connects to a Microsoft online service to determine your location. Windows Location Platform determines your PC’s location using hardware, such as a GPS sensor, or software, such as Windows Location Provider.         </p><h3>               Windows Location platform             </h3><p><strong>What this feature does</strong></p><p>If you choose to turn on the Windows Location Platform, apps you install from the Windows Store, as well as some Windows features, can ask for permission to determine your PC’s location. If you let an app use your location, in addition to providing your location while you use the app, Windows Location Platform can tell the app when your PC moves inside or outside of app-defined geographical boundaries. For example, an app could let you set a reminder to pick up groceries when you leave work. Depending on your system’s configuration, the Windows Location Platform may determine your PC’s location using hardware, such as a GPS sensor, or software, such as Windows Location Provider.</p><p>               Windows Location Platform doesn’t prevent apps from determining your PC’s location in other ways. For example, you can install devices (such as a GPS receiver) that might send location information directly to an app and bypass the platform. Regardless of your Windows Location Platform settings, online services can use your IP address to determine its approximate location—usually the city your PC is in.</p><p><strong>Information collected, processed, or transmitted</strong></p><p>The Windows Location Platform itself doesn’t transmit any information from your PC, but individual Location Providers (such as the Windows Location Provider) might transfer information when Windows Location Platform asks them to determine your PC’s location. Apps, websites, and features that are authorized to use the platform to determine your PC’s location could also transmit or store that information. If an app sets up geographical boundaries to monitor, those boundaries are stored encrypted on your PC. The information stored about these boundaries includes a name, a location, and whether your PC was inside or outside the boundary the last time its location was determined. Apps that set up geographical boundaries might transmit or store this information</p><p><strong>Use of information</strong></p><p>If you turn on the Windows Location Platform, authorized apps, websites, and Windows features will be able to access your PC’s location and use it to give you personalized content. If you use a third-party app or Location Provider, its use of your PC’s location is subject to the third party’s privacy practices. Before you download a Windows Store app, you’ll be able to see whether the app is location aware in the app description.</p><p><strong>Choice and control</strong></p><p>By choosing express settings during Windows Setup, you turn on the Windows Location Platform. If you choose to customize settings, you can control the Windows Location Platform by selecting Let Windows and apps request my location from the Windows Location Platform under Share info with Microsoft and other services. The first time each Store app requests your PC’s location, Windows will ask whether you want to allow the app to use your location. You can view and change this setting for each Store app in Permissions in the app’s settings. </p><p>If you use a desktop app that uses Windows Location Platform, it should ask your permission to use your PC’s location, and when it accesses your PC’s location, an icon will appear in the notification area to let you know that your PC’s location has been accessed. Each user can control their own location settings for apps in <strong>Privacy</strong> in PC settings. In addition, administrators can choose to turn off the location platform for all users in <strong>Location Settings</strong> in Control Panel. To prevent apps from being notified when geographic boundaries defined by apps are crossed, an administrative user can turn off the Windows Location Framework Service in Control Panel.</p><h3>               Windows Location Provider             </h3><p><strong>What this feature does</strong></p><p>               The Windows Location Provider connects to the online Microsoft Location Service, which helps determine your PC’s approximate location based on Wi‑Fi networks near your PC and your PC's IP address.</p><p><strong>Information collected, processed, or transmitted</strong></p><p>               When an app you’ve authorized to receive your location requests it, the Windows Location Platform will ask all installed Location Providers (including Windows Location Provider) to determine your PC's current location. The Windows Location Provider will first check to see if it has a stored list of nearby Wi‑Fi access points from a prior request made by a location-aware app. If there isn't already a list of nearby Wi‑Fi access points, or the list is out of date, the provider sends information about nearby Wi‑Fi access points and GPS information (if available) to the Microsoft Location Service. The service returns your PC’s approximate location back to the provider, which passes the location to the Windows Location Platform, which in turn provides it to the app that requested your PC's location. Windows Location Provider may also update its stored list of Wi‑Fi access points. The Windows Location Provider maintains this list so it can determine your PC’s approximate location without connecting to the Internet each time. This list of access points is encrypted when stored on disk so that apps can't directly access it.</p><p>The information that's sent about nearby Wi‑Fi access points includes BSSID (the MAC address of the Wi‑Fi access point) and signal strength. The GPS information includes observed latitude, longitude, direction, speed, and altitude. To help protect your privacy, Windows Location Provider doesn’t send any information to uniquely identify your PC beyond the standard computer information sent with all connections to the Internet. To help protect the privacy of Wi‑Fi network owners, Windows doesn’t send information about SSIDs (Wi‑Fi access point names) or hidden Wi‑Fi networks. For privacy and security purposes, information sent about Wi‑Fi networks is sent encrypted via SSL.</p><p>If you choose to help improve the Microsoft Location Service, Windows might send information about nearby Wi‑Fi access points to Microsoft again after an app has requested your PC’s location. If you’re using a metered Internet connection, Windows will limit the number of times per day it sends this information to limit the use of your Internet connection.</p><p><strong>Use of information</strong></p><p>               The information is used by the Windows Location Provider to give Windows Location Platform the approximate location of your PC when an authorized app requests it.             </p><p>If you choose to help improve the Microsoft Location Service, the Wi‑Fi and GPS info sent to Microsoft is used to improve Microsoft’s location services, which in turn helps to improve the location services provided to your apps. Microsoft doesn't store any data collected from this service that could be used to identify, contact, target advertising to you, or to track or create a history of your PC’s location.</p><p><strong>Choice and control</strong></p><p>               The Windows Location Provider is used only if an authorized app has requested your PC's location. For more info about how to control whether apps can request your PC's location, see the Windows Location Platform section. If you authorize apps to request your PC's location, the cached list of nearby Wi‑Fi access point locations that are encrypted and stored by the Windows Location Provider will be deleted and replaced periodically.</p><p>If you choose express settings while setting up Windows, you choose to help improve the Microsoft Location Service. If you choose to customize settings, you can control whether to help improve the Microsoft Location Service by selecting <strong>Send some location data to Microsoft  when location-aware apps are used</strong> under <strong>Help improve Microsoft products and services</strong>. After setting up Windows, you can change this setting in Location Settings in Control Panel. If you choose not to help improve the service, you'll still be able to use the Windows Location Provider to determine your PC’s approximate location.</p><p>               You can turn the Windows Location Provider on or off by opening <strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong> in Control Panel.

Windows features that use the TPM include Device Encryption, Virtual Smart Card, Secure Boot, Windows Defender, and TPM Based Certificate Storage.         </p><p><strong>Information collected, processed, or transmitted</strong></p><p>           By default, Windows takes ownership of the TPM and stores the full TPM owner authorization information so it’s only available to the Windows administrators. Limited authorization values are created to perform typical administrative actions and standard user actions and are managed by Windows.         </p><p>           The TPM Management Console allows you to interactively provision the TPM and save the TPM owner authorization value to external media like a USB flash drive after the TPM has been provisioned. A saved file contains the TPM owner authorization information for the TPM. The file also contains the PC name, operating system version, creation user, and creation date information to assist you in recognizing the file.         </p><p>           In a domain environment, the full TPM owner password can be configured by the domain administrator to be stored in Active Directory under a TPM object when the TPM is provisioned.         </p><p>           Each TPM has a unique cryptographic Endorsement Key that it uses to indicate its authenticity. The Endorsement Key can be created and stored in the TPM by your PC's manufacturer, or for older PCs, Windows might need to trigger creation of the Endorsement Key inside the TPM. The private portion of the Endorsement Key is never exposed outside of the TPM, and once it has been created, it usually can't be reset.  An Endorsement Key Certificate will be stored in the TPM of most Windows computers.  The Endorsement Key Certificate indicates that the Endorsement Key exists in a hardware TPM.  The certificate is useful for remote verifiers to confirm the TPM conforms to the TPM specifications.  The Endorsement Key Certificate is usually signed by the TPM manufacturer or the platform manufacturer.         </p><p><strong>Use of information</strong></p><p>           Once the TPM is initialized, apps can use the TPM to create and help secure additional unique cryptographic keys. For example, Device Encryption uses the TPM to help protect the key that encrypts the drive.         </p><p>           If you choose to save the TPM owner password to a file, the additional PC and user information saved inside this file helps you to identify the matching PC and TPM. The TPM endorsement key is used by Windows during TPM initialization to encrypt your TPM owner authorization value before sending it to the TPM. Windows doesn’t transmit cryptographic keys outside of your PC. Windows does provide an interface for third-party apps like antimalware software to use the Endorsement Key for certain TPM scenarios, such as Measured Boot with Attestation.  For antimalware software the endorsement key and the endorsement key certificate also are useful to confirm boot measurements are provided by a TPM from a specific manufacturer. By default, only administrators or apps with administrative rights can use the TPM endorsement key.         </p><p><strong>Choice and control</strong></p><p>           Users or administrators opt in to using the TPM by turning on a Windows feature or running an app that uses the TPM.         </p><p>           You can choose to clear the TPM and reset it to factory defaults. Clearing the TPM removes owner information, and with the exception of the endorsement key, all TPM-based keys or cryptographic information that apps might have created when the TPM was in use.         </p><p><a href="#TopOfPageTarget ">Top of Page</a></p></div><div class="m-b-bl" id="section_39"><h2 class="section-heading ">Update Root Certificates</h2><p><strong>What this feature does</strong></p><p>           Certificates are used primarily to verify the identity of a person or device, authenticate a service, or encrypt files. Trusted root certification authorities are the organizations that issue certificates. Update Root Certificates contacts the online Windows Update service to see if Microsoft has added a certification authority to its list of trusted authorities, but only when an app is presented with a certificate issued by a certification authority that isn't directly trusted (a certificate that isn't stored in a list of trusted certificates on your PC). If the certification authority has been added to the Microsoft list of trusted authorities, its certificate will automatically be added to the list of trusted certificates on your PC.         </p><p><strong>Information collected, processed, or transmitted</strong></p><p>           Update Root Certificates sends a request to the online Windows Update service that asks for the current list of root certification authorities in the Microsoft Root Certificate Program. If the untrusted certificate is on the list, Update Root Certificates obtains that certificate from Windows Update and places it in the trusted certificate store on your PC. The information transferred includes the names and cryptographic hashes of root certificates.         </p><p><strong>Use of information</strong></p><p>           The information is used by Microsoft to update the list of trusted certificates on your PC. Microsoft doesn’t use this information to identify, contact, or target advertising to you.         </p><p><strong>Choice and control</strong></p><p>           Update Root Certificates is turned on by default.

Advanced membership reports are more comprehensive and might occasionally contain personal information, for example, file paths and partial memory dumps. These reports, along with reports from other Windows Defender users who are participating in MAPS, help our researchers discover new threats more rapidly. Malware definitions are then created, and these updated definitions are made available to all users through Windows Update.</p><p>If you join MAPS, Windows Defender might send specific files or web content from your PC that Microsoft suspects might be potentially unwanted software. The sample report is used for further analysis. If a file is likely to contain personal information, you'll be prompted before it is sent. If Windows Update hasn't been able to obtain updated signatures for Windows Defender for a period of time, Windows Defender will attempt to use MAPS to download signatures from an alternate download location.</p><p>To help protect your privacy, all information sent to MAPS is sent encrypted via SSL.</p><p>To help detect and fix certain kinds of malware infections, Windows Defender regularly sends MAPS some information about the security state of your PC.

When you first connect to the Store, a list of all the apps preinstalled on your PC is sent to the Store, which then associates licenses for those apps with your Store account.</p><p>               As you browse the Store and use apps from it, Microsoft collects some information to help us understand usage patterns and trends, similar to the way many websites analyze their visitors’ browsing data.</p><p><strong>Use of information</strong></p><p>               Microsoft uses your contact information to send you email necessary to provide the Store services, such as receipts for apps you buy. It uses your payment information to let you pay for purchases; if you choose to store this information, you won't need to enter it every time. Microsoft uses information about your purchases to operate the Store and provide customer support.             </p><p>               The Store keeps track of all the apps you’ve installed. You can use the Store to manage the list of devices you’ve installed apps on, and customer support can also help you manage this information. Once you install an app, you'll always be able to see it in your Store purchase history, even if you choose to uninstall it. The Store also uses this list to help enforce the limit on the number of PCs you can install apps on, as described in the Windows Store terms of use. When you write a review for an app, the name and account picture associated with your Windows account will be published next to the review in the Store. If you report a problem with an app, the problem report is made available to Store representatives to assess and take action on. They might use your name and the email address associated with your Store account to contact you, if necessary, when they review the report.             </p><p>               When there are updates available to apps you’ve installed, a notification will display in the Store, and the Store’s tile will indicate the number of available updates. You can then view the list of available updates and choose which ones to install. Updated apps might use different Windows capabilities than the previous versions, which could give them access to different resources on your PC. You can see the updated lists of capabilities on the App Description pages linked to from the page listing available updates.             </p><p>               The Store uses the information it collects about your copy of Windows to determine how Windows was installed on your PC (for example, whether your PC’s manufacturer preinstalled it). This information allows the Store to let you access apps provided exclusively by that manufacturer for its customers. It is also used to provide information to Microsoft (and in aggregate to the manufacturer, in some cases) about Windows usage patterns.             </p><p>               Microsoft uses some app purchase and usage data in aggregate to learn how people use the Store (for example, how users find the apps they install). Microsoft might share some of these aggregate statistics with app developers. Microsoft doesn't share any of your personal information with app developers.

App updates may include security updates, performance updates, or new functionality or content.  Updated apps might use different Windows capabilities than the previous versions, which could give them access to different resources on your PC. You can learn about capability changes on the Product Description Page for the app in the Windows Store.</p><p><strong>Information collected, processed, or transmitted</strong></p><p>To provide automatic app updates, the Store sends the following information to Microsoft:</p><ul><li><p>A list of all the apps installed from the Store by all users on your PC</p></li><li><p>The licensing information for each app</p></li><li><p>The successes, failures, and errors you experience when updating apps from the Store</p></li><li><p>Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) – a randomly generated number that doesn't contain any personal information</p></li><li><p>BIOS name, revision number, and revision date</p></li><li><p>Basic information about your PC, such as manufacturer, model, and the edition of Windows you’re using</p></li></ul><p><strong>Use of information</strong></p><p>This information is used to provide the update service.

It isn’t used to identify, contact, or target advertising to you. </p><p><strong>Choice and control</strong></p><p>If you choose express settings when setting up Windows, the Windows Store will check for, download, and install app updates automatically, even if you’re signed out of the Windows Store. If you turn off automatic app updates, you can choose whether or not you want to install an app update when you sign in to the Windows Store. </p><p>To turn off automatic app updates:</p><ol><li><p>Open the Windows Store.</p></li><li><p>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, then tap <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>If you’re using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, then click <strong>Settings.</strong></p></li><li><p>Tap or click <strong>App updates</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Tap or click <strong>Automatically update my apps</strong> to turn off automatic app updates.</p></li></ol><p>To learn about what the most current version of the app can do, and to learn when an app was last updated, you can review the Product Description Page for the app in the Windows Store.  </p><h3>Permission for Store apps</h3><p><strong>What this feature does</strong></p><p>               Many apps you install from the Windows Store are designed to take advantage of specific hardware and software features of your PC. For example, a photo app might need to use your webcam, and a restaurant guide might need to know your location to provide nearby recommendations.             </p><p><strong>Information collected, processed, or transmitted</strong></p><p>Here’s a list of features that apps must disclose they use:</p><ul><li><p>Your Internet connection. Allows the app to connect to the Internet.                 </p></li><li><p>Incoming connections through a firewall. Allows the app to send information to or from your PC through a firewall.                 </p></li><li><p>A home or work network. Allows the app to send information between your PC and other PCs on the same network                 </p></li><li><p>Your pictures, videos, music, or documents libraries. Allows the app to access, change, or delete files in your libraries. This includes access to any additional data embedded in these files, such as location information in photos.                 </p></li><li><p>Removable storage. Allows the app to access, add, change, or delete files on an external hard drive, USB flash drive, or portable device.                 </p></li><li><p>                     Your Windows credentials.

Allows the app to manage your mobile broadband account.                 </p></li></ul><p>               You’ll see the features an app uses listed on its App Description page. If you install an app, Windows will allow it to use these features, except for location, text messaging, and webcam and microphone, which are considered especially sensitive. When an app requests access to one of these sensitive features for the first time, Windows will ask you whether you want to allow the app to use it. You can change whether the app can use it at any time.             </p><p>In addition to the permissions above, if an app requests information from a device that stores information about you or your behavior, Windows will ask you whether you want to allow the app to use it. For example, if you connect a fitness device that tracks your location, Windows will ask if you want to allow the app to access it.</p><p><strong>Use of information</strong></p><p>Each app's use of these features will be subject to its developer's privacy practices. If an app uses one of the sensitive features described above, a link to the app publisher's privacy statement will be available on its App Description page in the Store.</p><p><strong>Choice and control</strong></p><p>               You can see what features an app requires in the Store before installing the app. Windows will ask whether you want to allow or deny access to the most sensitive of these features—location, text messaging, webcam, and microphone—before the first time each app uses them.             </p><p>               When you look at an app’s App Description page in the Windows Store, there will be an abbreviated list of the features used by the app at the bottom of the left column. You can see the full list on the Details page of the App Description. After you install an app, you can see the full list of features it uses at any time, and control its access to the especially sensitive ones. To do this, open the app, open <strong>Settings</strong>, and then select <strong>Permissions</strong>.</p><h3>Personalized Store search and app recommendations</h3><p><strong>What this feature does</strong></p><p>When you browse or search for apps in the Windows Store, Microsoft provides recommendations and search results to help you find apps that are relevant to you.</p><p><strong>Information collected, processed, or transmitted</strong></p><p>To help improve search results, Windows Store sends information to Microsoft about how you interact with it, including what you search for and what search results you select. Windows Store also sends an identifier associated with your Microsoft account to provide personalized search results based on your interactions with Bing and other Microsoft products and services. You can choose not to get personalized results, in which case the identifier won't be sent.</p><p><strong>Use of information</strong></p><p>The Store uses the identifier associated with your Microsoft account to provide personalized search results and recommendations based on your interactions with the Store and other Microsoft products and services, such as Bing and the Windows Phone Store. This includes information such as apps you’ve purchased, profile information you’ve provided in your Microsoft account, and your ratings and reviews of apps. This information may also be used to personalize other Microsoft products and services.</p><p><strong>Choice and control</strong></p><p>When you’re signed in to Windows with a Microsoft account, Windows Store personalized results and recommendations are turned on by default. You can choose not to get personalized results and recommendations from the Store in the <strong>Preferences</strong> section of Store settings.</p><h3>               Help improve the Windows Store by sending URLs for web content that apps use</h3><p><strong>What this feature does</strong></p><p>               Some apps you get from the Store are like websites and might expose your computer to potentially unsafe software, such as malware.  If you choose to turn this feature on, it collects information about the web content used by these apps to help Microsoft diagnose potentially unsafe behavior. For example, Microsoft might use this information to remove an app from the Store.             </p><p><strong>Information collected, processed, or transmitted</strong></p><p>               If you choose to send information about the web content used by your apps, Microsoft will collect information about the URLs and types of content that these apps access when you use them. This can help us identify which of these apps are receiving content from harmful or unsafe websites. Reports sent to Microsoft include information such as the name or identifier of the app, the full URLs of addresses the app accesses, and full URLs that indicate the location of any JavaScript that the app accesses. Windows generates a number called a globally unique identifier (GUID) that is sent to Microsoft with each report. The GUID lets us determine which data is sent from a particular computer over time. The GUID doesn’t contain any personal information and isn’t used to identify you.             </p><p>               To help protect your privacy, the information sent to Microsoft is encrypted. Information that might be associated with a webpage that these apps access, such as search terms or data you entered into apps, might be included. For example, if you look up a word in a dictionary app, the word you look up might be included in the information sent to Microsoft as part of the full address accessed by the app. Microsoft filters these addresses to try to remove personal information where possible.             </p><p><strong>Use of information</strong></p><p>               Microsoft periodically reviews the information sent to help detect apps that might be interacting with unsafe web content, such as harmful web addresses or scripts. We might use this information to take action against potentially harmful apps. Addresses of web content can unintentionally contain personal information, but this information isn't used to identify, contact, or target advertising to you. We use the GUID to determine how widespread the feedback we receive is and how to prioritize it. For example, the GUID allows Microsoft to distinguish between potentially unsafe behavior occurring 100 times on a single PC, and the same behavior occurring once on each of 100 PCs.             </p><p><strong>Choice and control</strong></p><p>               If you choose express settings while setting up Windows, Windows will send information about the web content used by your apps from the Store built using JavaScript. If you choose to customize settings, you can control this setting by selecting <strong>                 Use SmartScreen online services to help protect against malicious content in sites loaded by Windows Store apps and Internet&nbsp;Explorer, and in malicious downloads</strong> under <strong>Help improve Microsoft products and services</strong>. After installation, you can change this setting in <strong>Privacy</strong> in PC settings.</p><p><a href="#TopOfPageTarget ">Top of Page</a></p></div><div class="m-b-bl" id="section_54"><h2 class="section-heading ">           Windows Time service         </h2><p><strong>What this feature does</strong></p><p>           The Windows Time service automatically synchronizes your PC's time with a time server on a network.         </p><p><strong>Information collected, processed, or transmitted</strong></p><p>           The service connects to a time server over the Internet or a local network using the industry standard Network Time Protocol.

AD FS helps administrators enable users to collaborate across organizations and to easily access apps on local or other networks, while maintaining app security. AD FS uses a security token service that uses Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to authenticate users and issue them security tokens using various protocols. The token is digitally signed and contains claims about the user, which come from each or any combination of AD DS, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), SQL&nbsp;Server, or a custom store.         </p><p><strong>Information collected, processed, or transmitted</strong></p><p>           A user’s credentials are collected when the user authenticates with AD FS. The credentials are immediately sent to Active Directory Domain Services for authentication, and AD FS doesn't store them locally. The user’s attributes in Active Directory Domain Services might be used to generate&nbsp;outgoing claims, depending on the claim rules that an AD FS administrator has configured.  Outgoing claims will be sent to trusted partners that an AD FS administrator has established a trust relationship with.
