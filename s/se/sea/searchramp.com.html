SearchRamp.com does not collect personally identifying information about any 
individual web site user except when 
            knowingly provided by such individual. For example, when a visitor 
            comes to SearchRamp.com to read an article, we do not

When a person submits a URL to be evaluated and possibly added to 
            our search index and/or our directory of web sites, we require the person to include an email address to 
            receive a confirmation email when the URL has been added to our 
            database.&nbsp; You always have the option not to provide the 
            information we request. If you choose not to provide the information 
            we request, you can still utilize most of the SearchRamp.com Web

            contain information, such as a user identification code, that the

            Most Web site browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can 
            usually change your browser settings to display a warning before

            <br>
            Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your 
experience on our Web site. We achieve this goal by, among other things, 
providing interactive communications such as our welcome email, and developing 
future products and services based on your interests. To develop content

            advertising. In order to attract and retain advertisers we may use 
            the aggregated, anonymous information that we gather to describe our

            third-party service to serve their advertisements, may set their own 
            cookies. <br>

            what the user sees as Web pages. Netscape Navigator and Microsoft 
            Internet Explorer are examples of Web browsers. Browser type
