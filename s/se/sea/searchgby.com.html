A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your computer when you visit a web site or use a service. When stored on your computer, a cookie uniquely identifies your browser and records your preferences and other data about your visit or use. Cookies are also sometimes used to complete transactions requested by users. Web beacons, also known as web bugs, are small, graphic images that transparently reside on a web site or other web-based service and are designed to allow the web site or service owner to monitor who is visiting the web site or using the service. Action tags assist in delivering cookies and embed a random identifying number on a user's browser. We use information collected from these devices to track which pages our users view, which browsers they use, and other information about user activity when visiting the Sites or using our Services. We also use the information collected and stored by cookies to help us provide you with personalized features and preferences when using our Services in a manner that is linked to personal user information you elect to share with us. We use action tags to compile statistics and other data about our users on an aggregate basis.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For a session cookie, once you close your browser the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie stays stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can change the settings on your browser to refuse or notify you prior to accepting cookies and to remove them from your computer. However, some features and services may not function properly without cookies.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c6">Third Party Advertisements.</span><span class="c5"> From time to time,we will engage third party advertisement networks that may place cookies on your computer when accessing and using our Services. These cookies collect anonymous, non-personal information regarding your access and use of our Sites, and are used by us and our third party advertising network partners to identify and target related advertising to the computer's user when on the Sites or web sites within the third party's advertising network. Some of these third party advertising networks are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (</span><span class="c5 c6 c15">"NAI"</span><span class="c5">) and subject to the NAI Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Preference Marketing by Network Advertisers, available at </span><span class="c5 c9">www.networkadvertising.org</span><span class="c5"> (the </span><span class="c5 c15 c6">"NAI Principles"</span><span class="c5">). If you would like to opt-out from these services from NAI members, you may go to the NAI Non-PII Opt-Out Page, located at </span><span class="c0"><a class="c11" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a></span><span class="c5">, or the opt-out page of the particular third party advertising network identified in the cookie.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c6">Generally.</span><span class="c5"> In general, we use your personal information for the purpose it was collected, including internally to serve you the web sites and services you request, to enhance and extend our relationship with you, and to improve our Sites and Services.

When you conduct a search on the Sites, we use the search terms you submit along with the information set forth above to provide you with relevant search results, including results tailored to your geographic location based on the Internet Protocol address of your computer. This information is also used to maintain and improve the quality, security, and integrity of our Services and to detect and protect against security threats such as botnet attacks, click fraud, and worms.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c6">Inter-Company Transfers.</span><span class="c5"> We may internally transfer the information we collect, including your personal information, to and from the United States and any other country in which we or our agents maintain facilities for the purposes identified above, as well as for storage, processing, or other business use as permitted under this Privacy Policy. By accessing or using the Sites or our Services, you consent to the transfer of your personal information among these facilities, including those located outside of your country of residence.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">4. HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">In general, we do not sell, rent, or otherwise trade your personally identifiable information ("PII") with third parties. However, we do share your PII with third parties when we believe the sharing is permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer our services, or when legally required to do so. For example, sharing of your PII may take place under the following limited circumstances:</span></p><ol class="c8" start="1"><li class="c3"><span class="c4 c6">Consent. When we have received your consent or permission.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c4 c6"> Transaction Processing.</span><span class="c4"> When it is necessary to complete a requested transaction, such as verification of your credit card information.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c4 c6"> Third Party Service Providers.</span><span class="c4"> Occasionally, we engage third parties to provide us with products and services, such as support, consulting, statistical analysis, and marketing research that may require access to or use of your personal information. In such event, the third party will be obligated to maintain the privacy of any PII disclosed or shared as part of its provision to us of the product or service and to only use such information for that limited purpose. </span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c4 c6"> Business Transfers.</span><span class="c4"> Information about our users and the access and use of the </span><span class="c5">searchgby</span><span class="c4"> Sites and our products and services is one of our most important business assets. As such, information about our users, including PII, may be disclosed and transferred as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide our products and services, and the sale or pledge of company assets, as well as in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which PII would be transferred as one of the business assets. </span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c4 c6"> To Respond to Legal Requests and Prevent Harm.</span><span class="c4"> We may disclose, remove, destroy, or alter PII in our possession or control pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requests. Such action will only be done if we have a good faith belief that the response is necessary to comply with the legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect our rights, property, or the safety of our employees, customers, or the public.</span></li></ol><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c6">Anonymous Information.</span><span class="c5">We may access, use, disclose, and share any anonymous, non-PII and data we collect for any business purpose and with any third party in our sole discretion.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c6">Third Party Information Collection and Use. </span><span class="c5">The Sites and our Services use and provide access to products, services, and content of third parties ("Third Party Properties"), such as third party search results, web sites, links, and advertisements. Please be aware that we do not control and are not responsible for the information collection and use practices and policies of these third parties, and that by accessing or using Third Party Properties they may collect information regarding your use and access. In general, clicking on third party links on the Sites, whether part of a search result, advertisement, or other content, will allow the third party provider of the result, link, or content to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information about your browser and activity. We encourage you to be aware when you click on a link or visit a Third Party Property or otherwise leave our Sites, to review any such third party's data and information collection and use practices and policies with regard to their web site, products, or services.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">5. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">We have implemented and use a variety of industry-accepted physical, electronic, and managerial policies and procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect to help prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction and to maintain its accuracy and correct use.

However, you may not be able to access or use some features of the Sites, Services, and some of our other services if you choose not to provide us with the information required for those services.
