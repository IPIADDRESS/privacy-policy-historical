		 <h2>Search 4 Career Colleges Privacy Policy &amp; Terms of Use</h2>
		 <p>Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the highest-quality
		    products and services with the highest level of integrity. It is designed to assist you
		    in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide
		    and to help you in making informed decisions when using our site, products and services.
		    This Privacy Policy will be continually assessed against new technologies, business practices
		    and our customers'
needs.</p>
		 <p> Access to and use of the Search 4 Career Colleges web site is available only to United
			  States residents who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law.
			  If you do not qualify, you may not use the web site. In compliance with the Children's
			  Online Privacy
			  Protection Act of 1998, no one under 13 years of age can use the web site. If
			  you are a minor between the ages of 13 and 18, you may use the site only in conjunction
			  with your
			  parent, legal guardian or other responsible adult.</p>
			<p> As described below, some of your personally identifiable information will be used by
			  us and shared with third parties. By using the web site, you expressly consent to our
			  use of your personal information, and also to the disclosure to and use of this information
			  by third parties. You acknowledge that communications to, from and through the Search 4 Career Colleges
			  web site are not confidential. You agree that by submitting communications through the
			  Search 4 Career Colleges web site, no confidential, fiduciary, contractually implied, or
			  other relationship is created between you and Search 4 Career Colleges other than pursuant
			  to this Privacy Policy. </p>

			<h3>What information do we collect?</h3>
			<p> Search 4 Career Colleges collects personally identifiable information you voluntarily
			  choose to disclose, and "aggregate information" that is automatically collected
			  when you visit the web site. </p>
			<p> Personally identifiable information refers to information that tells us specifically
			  who you are and is collected when you choose to request information from a school
			  that is listed on the site. This information can include your name, current e-mail address,
			  programs of interest and other information you choose to provide. If you choose
			  to correspond
			  with us through e-mail, we may retain your e-mail address and messages together
			  with our responses. </p>
			<p> Aggregate information is automatically provided by your computer and cannot be tied
			  back to you as a specific individual. Examples include:</p>

			<ul>
              <li> referral data (the web sites you visited just before and just after the
                web site)</li>
              <li> date and time of your visits</li>
              <li> pages viewed and time spent at the web site</li>
              <li> browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform)</li>

              <li> Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address is a number that is automatically
                assigned to your computer on the Internet</li>
	  </ul>
			<h3>Cookies</h3>
			<p> Search 4 Career Colleges uses cookie technology to allow us to deliver customized information
			  to you and track which site features are most popular. Cookies let sites and advertisers "remember" users
			  across pages of a site and across multiple visits to a site. In addition, your computer
			  may occasionally receive cookies from our advertisers. Search 4 Career Colleges does not
			  control these cookies, and they are not subject to our Privacy Policy. You can disable
			  cookies, but doing so may impact the functioning of parts of the Search 4 Career Colleges
			  site.</p>
			<h3> How do we use the personal information that you provide to us?</h3>

			<p> Broadly speaking, your personal information is used to help match your interests with
			  schools that provide the training you seek. If your search yields no results,
			  we may store your information and send you updates if and when programs you specified
			  do become available.
			  We also use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities,
			  providing customer service, and making  other products and services available
			  to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information
			  we collect
			  to notify you about important changes to the web site, new services and special
			  offers we
			  think you will find valuable.</p>
			<h3> Sharing information with third parties</h3>
			<p> Search 4 Career Colleges offers a number of third-party services from the Site through
			  Co-Brand Service Provider and — if you choose to use these optional services  — may
			  share some of your personally identifiable information with the Co-Brand Service
			  Provider offering
			  such services. In addition, Search 4 Career Colleges may enter into strategic
			  marketing alliances with third parties such as advertisers, businesses, partners
			  and subsidiaries who may be given access to personal information, including your name,
			  address
			  and e-mail,
			  for the purpose of providing you with information about products and services
			  that may be of interest to you. We cannot and do not make any representations
			  about the practices
			  and policies of these companies, and they are not subject to our Privacy Policy.</p>
			<h3> Information collected in ad delivery </h3>

			<p> Search 4 Career Colleges may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our
			  behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single-pixel
			  gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that
			  these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.</p>
			<h3> How do we protect your information?</h3>
			<p> We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality of personal
			  information we collect. This software provides a limited degree of protection against
	  unauthorized access or disclosure, as well as accidental loss, alteration or destruction. </p>
			<h3>		      Do we comply with legally compelled disclosure of information?</h3>
			<p> We may release any private information about you that we possess when we believe release
			  is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce or apply our Privacy Policy
			  and/or other agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Search 4 Career Colleges,
			  the
	  site users, or others.</p>

			<h3>		      What about other  sites linked to Search 4 Career Colleges?</h3>
			<p>Many of the links in the Search 4 Career Colleges web site allow you to leave the site. Please
			  be aware that once you leave the site and enter another web site, our Privacy
			  Policy is no longer in effect. Search 4 Career Colleges is not responsible for
			  the privacy practices
			  employed by these sites, nor the information or content contained therein. Please
			  read over the rules and policies of these sites before proceeding.</p>
			<p>Although our site is called Search 4 Career Colleges, we feature a variety of educational options: technical schools, training centers, universities and other institutions that may or may not be classified as colleges. </p>
			<h3>Search 4 Career Colleges web site accessibility statement</h3>
			<p> The majority of the pages on this web site are accessible to individuals with disabilities
			  in accordance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. In addition, images
			  on our web site are accompanied by alternative text describing graphics if your
			  browser supports
			  the alt-text function. Documents on our web site are generally accessible to
			  users using screen-reading software. </p>
			<a name="tellafriend"></a>
			<h3> Tell a Friend</h3>

			<p> We take the privacy of our users very seriously, and as such, no information from the
			  Tell a Friend link is logged at any time. Tell a Friend is a referral service
			  in which e-mail addresses are used only to send this one-time message. The e-mail
			  addresses are
			  then automatically wiped from our system, and neither the e-mail addresses nor
			  the names of either party are kept, stored or sold at any time. The e-mail sent
			  is immediate, the information
			  is not passed along to our server and no data is kept for comparison purposes.
			  Because of this, it is possible to receive more than one e-mail from our site,
			  and we apologize
			  for any inconvenience this may cause. </p>
