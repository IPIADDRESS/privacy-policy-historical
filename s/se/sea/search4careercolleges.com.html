<h2>Privacy Policy  </h2>
<p>Our Privacy Policy was developed 
  as an extension of our commitment to combine the highest-quality products and 
  services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our visitors, members 
  and partners. It is designed not only to assist you in understanding how we 
  collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us, but 
  also to help you in making informed decisions when using our site and our products 
  and services. This Privacy Policy will be continually assessed against new 
  technologies, business practices and our customers' needs.</p>
 <p>This 
    Privacy Policy shall apply to the following PlattForm Advertising, Inc. properties: Search4College.com,
   Search4CareerColleges.com, Search4Art-Schools.com, Search4Automotive-Training.com, Search4Aviation-Schools.com,
   Search4Business-Schools.com,
     Search4California-Colleges.com, Search4Community-Colleges.com, Search4Computer-Schools.com,

     Search4Texas-Colleges.com, Search4TruckDriving-Schools.com, Search4Vocational-Training.com,
     Search4Welding-Schools.com and Career Explorer (collectively and individually
   hereinafter referred to as the "Search4 family of web sites," "the Web site," or   "the Site"). </p>
 <p>Access to and use of the Search4 
    family of web sites is available only to United States residents who can form 
    legally binding contracts under applicable law. If you do not qualify, you may 
    not use the Web site. If you are a minor, you may use the Search4 family of 
    web sites only in conjunction with your parent, legal guardian, or other responsible 
    adult. We urge supervising adults to actively oversee minors' online 
   use.</p>
 <p>    As 
      described below, some of your personally identifiable information will be used 
      by us and shared with third parties. By using the Web site, you expressly consent 
      to our use of your personal information, and also to the disclosure to and use 
       of this information by third parties. You acknowledge that communications to, 
      from and through the Search4 family of web sites are not confidential. You agree 
      that by submitting communications through the Search4 family of web sites, no 
      confidential, fiduciary, contractually implied, or other relationship is created 
      between you and PlattForm Advertising, Inc. other than pursuant to this Privacy 
      Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms and 
     conditions of our Terms and Conditions.</p>
 <p>    <b>A 
      Note About Minors<br>
    </b>In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, 
      no one under 13 years of age can use the Web site. If you are a minor between 
      the ages of 13 and 18, you may use the Site only in conjunction with your parent, 
     legal guardian, or other responsible adult.</p>
 <p>    <b>What 
      Information Do We Collect?<br>
      </b>The goal of the Search4 family of web sites is to be your favorite college 
      search destination on the Internet by providing you with the information, services 
      and product offerings that are most relevant to you. To achieve this goal, we 
      collect two types of information from you when you visit the Site: personally 
      identifiable information you voluntarily choose to disclose, and "aggregate 
      information" about your use of the Site, which  is automatically collected 
     when you visit the Web site. </p>
 <ol>
   <li><strong>Personal Information You Choose to Provide</strong><br>
          Personally identifiable information refers to information that tells us 
          specifically who you are. Personal information is collected when you voluntarily
           choose to request information from a school that is listed on the Site. As a 
          site user, you are asked to provide certain basic information such as your name,
           current e-mail address and programs of interest. You may also provide additional
          
          personal information at your discretion. Further, if you choose to correspond with
           us through e-mail, we may retain the content of your e-mail messages together 
          with your e-mail address and our responses.       <br>
       <br>
       <b>How 
          Do We Use The Personal Information That You Provide To Us?<br>
     </b>Broadly speaking, your personal information is used to help match your interests
           with schools that provide the training you seek. If your search yields no results,
          we may store your information and send you updates if and when programs you 
          specified do become available. <br>
       <br>
       We 
          also use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities,
           providing customer service, and making available other products and services
          to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the 
          information we collect to notify you about important changes to the Web site, 
   new services and special offers we think you will find valuable.<br>
   <br>
   </li>
   <li><b>    Aggregate Information</b><br>
       Aggregate information refers to information your computer automatically provides 
          to us and that cannot be tied back to you as a specific individual. Examples 
          include referral data (the web sites you visited just before and just after 
          the Web site) the date and time of your visits, the pages viewed, time spent 
          at the Web site, browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh
       platform), and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. An IP address is a number that
          is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web. When you 
          request a page from one of our Sites, our servers log your IP address to create 
          aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers 
          and partners, and for purposes of system administration. This allows these parties
       to advertise more effectively and allows you to receive advertisements that
          are most relevant to your personal interests. <br>
          <br>
   </li>
   <li><b>Cookies<br>
          </b>The Search4 family of web sites, along with thousands of other web sites,
                uses standard technologies, such as cookies and web server logs
                to enhance your web viewing experience. Cookies and web server logs automatically
                track certain information about you that is based upon your activity on the
                Site. A cookie is a small piece of data transferred from a web site to the
                hard
          drive of your computer so that the web site may track your activities on the 
          site. Web server logs allow us to count how many people visit the Web site and 
          also to evaluate the Site's visitor capacity. <br>
       <br>
       Each 
          time you access the Site, our server may deliver certain customized information 
          to you based on the data stored in your cookies. Cookies allow us to determine 
          which areas and features of our Site are most popular by measuring user activity.
          The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users as
          they move from one page to another. Cookies let sites and advertisers "remember" users
          across pages of a site and across multiple visits to a site. This allows e-commerce
          and Internet advertising to: personalize features such as targeted
          news stories, provide shopping sessions and quick navigation across multiple 
          zones of e-commerce sites, remember user names and passwords for future visits, 
          control ad frequency or the number of times a user sees a given ad, and deliver 
          advertisements targeted to a user's interests. Your computer may occasionally 
          receive cookies from our advertisers. PlattForm Advertising, Inc. does not control
          these cookies, and they are not subject to our Privacy Policy. You can disable
          cookies, but access to certain parts of the Web site may no longer be available 
   to you. </li>
 </ol>
 <p>      <b>Sharing 
          Information With Co-Brand Service Providers<br>
          </b>PlattForm Advertising, Inc. offers a number of third party services from 
            the Site. If you choose to use these optional services, we may provide some 
            of your personally identifiable information to the Co-Brand Service Provider 
            offering such services. Conversely, the Co-Brand Service Provider may provide 
PlattForm Advertising, Inc. with personal information about you.</p>
 <p>   <b>Sharing 
              Information With Affiliated Businesses, Strategic Partners, Subsidiaries, Advertisers, 
              And Other Third Parties<br>
  </b>We may enter into 
              strategic marketing alliances with third parties, such as advertisers, businesses,
              strategic partners and subsidiaries, who may be given access to personal information,
              including your name, address and e-mail, for the purpose of providing you with
              information about products and services that may be of interest to you. Advertisers
              and other third parties may place cookies on your browser when you visit the
              Site. PlattForm Advertising, Inc. has no control over what third parties do 
              with this information. Further, we cannot and do not make any representations
                about the practices and policies of these companies.</p>
 <p><strong>Information Collected In Ad Delivery</strong>   <br>
     We 
              may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These 
              companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs
              or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these
third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.</p>
 <p><b>Notice 
            Of New Services And Changes<br>
                    </b>Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect
                                   to notify you about important changes to the Web site, new
                                   services, and special
                           offers we think
you will find valuable. </p>
 <p>      <b>How 
                Do We Protect Your Information?<br>
                                          </b>We utilize encryption/security software to
                                            safeguard the confidentiality of personal information
                                            we collect.
                                            This software provides a limited degree
                  of protection against unauthorized access or disclosure, as well as accidental
                     loss, alteration or destruction.
</p>
 <p><b>Do 
        We Comply With Legally Compelled Disclosure Of Information?<br>
    </b>We may release any private information about you that we possess when we 
        believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce or apply our 
        Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy and/or other agreements, or to protect 
        the rights, property or safety of PlattForm Advertising, Inc., the Site users, 
   or others.</p>
 <p><b>What 
          About Other Web Sites Linked To Or From The Web Site?<br>
     </b>The links in the Search4 family of web sites allow you to leave the Site. 
          Please be aware that once you leave the Site and enter another web site, or 
          use certain services provided through the Site, our Privacy Policy is no longer 
          in effect. Your browsing and interaction on web sites that have a link to the 
          Web site, or any links contained in a linked site, is subject to that web site's
      own rules and policies. PlattForm Advertising, Inc. is not responsible for the
          privacy practices employed by these sites, nor the information or content contained
     therein. We provide these links to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion
          of any link does not imply endorsement by PlattForm Advertising, Inc. of the 
site. Please read over the rules and policies of these sites before proceeding.</p>
 <a name="tellafriend"></a>
 <p><strong>Tell A Friend</strong><br>
   We take the privacy of our users very seriously, and as such, no information from the Tell-a-Friend
   link is logged at any time. Tell-a-Friend is a referral service in which e-mail addresses
   are used only to send this one-time message. The e-mail addresses are then automatically
   wiped from our system, and neither e-mail addresses nor names of either party are kept,
   stored or sold at any time. The e-mail sent is immediate, the information is not passed
   along to our server, and no data is kept for comparison purposes. Because of this, it is
   possible  to receive more than one e-mail from our site, and we apologize for
 any inconvenience this may cause. </p>
