<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our Privacy Policy was developed 
  as an extension of our commitment to combine the highest-quality products and 
  services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our visitors, members, 
  and partners. It is designed not only to assist you in understanding how we 
  collect, use, and safeguard the personal information you provide to us, but 
  also to help you in making informed decisions when using our Site and our products 
  and services. This Privacy Policy will be continuously assessed against new 
  technologies, business practices, and our customers' needs.</font><br>
</p>
 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
  Privacy Policy shall apply to the following PlattForm Advertising, Inc. properties: 
  the Web site(s) Search4College.com, Search4CareerColleges.com, Search4Art-Schools.com, 
  Search4Automotive-Training.com, Search4Aviation-Schools.com, Search4Business-Schools.com,

  hereinafter referred to as the "Search4 family of web sites," the 
  "Web site," or the "Site."). Access to and use of the Search4 
  family of web sites is available only to United States residents who can form 
  legally binding contracts under applicable law. If you do not qualify, you may 
  not use our Web site. If you are a minor, you may use the Search4 family of 
  web sites only in conjunction with your parent, legal guardian, or other responsible 
  adult supervision. We urge supervising adults to actively oversee minors' online 
  use.<br>
  </font>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
  described below, some of your personally identifiable information will be used 
  by us and shared with third parties. By using our Web site, you expressly consent 
  to our use of your personal information, and also to the disclosure to and use 
  by third parties of this information. You acknowledge that communications to, 
  from and through the Search4 family of web sites are not confidential. You agree 
  that by submitting communications through the Search4 family of web sites, no 
  confidential, fiduciary, contractually implied, or other relationship is created 
  between you and PlattForm Advertising, Inc. other than pursuant to this Privacy 
  Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms and 
  conditions of our Terms and Conditions.<br>
  </font> <br>
 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>A 
  Note About Minors<br>
  </b>In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, 
  no one under 13 years of age can use our web site. If you are a minor between 
  the ages of 13 and 18, you may use our wite only in conjunction with your parent, 
  legal guardian, or other responsible adult.</font><br><br>
 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What 
  Information Do We Collect?<br>
  </b>The goal of the Search4 family of web sites is to be your favorite college 
  search destination on the Internet by providing you with the information, services 
  and product offerings that are most relevant to you. To achieve this goal, we 
  collect two types of information from you when you visit our Site: personally 
  identifiable information you voluntarily choose to disclose, and "aggregate 
  information" about your use of our Site that is automatically collected 
  when you visit our web site.</font> <br><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1. 
  Personal Information You Choose to Provide<br>
  </b>Personally identifiable information refers to information that tells us 
  specifically who you are. Personal information is collected when you voluntarily 
  choose to request information from a school that is listed on our site. As a 
  site user, you are asked to provide certain basic information such as your name, 
  current email address and programs of interest. You may also provide additional 
  personal information at your option. Further, if you choose to correspond with 
  us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together 
  with your email address and our responses.<br>
  </font><br><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>How 
  Do We Use The Personal Information That You Provide To Us?<br>
  </b>Broadly speaking, your personal information is used to help match your interests 
  with schools that provide the training you seek. If your search yields no results, 
  we may store your information and send you updates if and when programs you 
  specified do become available. </font><br><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
  also use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, 
  providing customer service, and making available other products and services 
  to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the 
  information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Web site, 
  new services, and special offers we think you will find valuable.<br>
  </font><br><br>
<br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>2. 
  Aggregate Information</b><br>
  Aggregate information refers to information your computer automatically provides 
  to us and that cannot be tied back to you as a specific individual. Examples 
  include referral data (the web sites you visited just before and just after 
  our Web site) the date and time of your visits, the pages viewed, time spent 
  at our Web site, browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh 
  platform), and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. An IP address is a number that 
  is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web. When you 
  request a page from one of our Sites, our servers log your IP address to create 
  aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers 
  and partners, and for purposes of system administration. This allows these parties 
  to advertise more effectively, and allows you to receive advertisements that 
  are most relevant to your personal interests. 
  </font><br><br>
 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>3. 
  "Cookies"<br>
  </b>The Search4 family of web site, along with thousands of other web sites, 
  uses standard technologies, such as "cookies" and web server logs, 
  to enhance your web viewing experience. Cookies and web server logs automatically 
  track certain information about you that is based upon your activity on our 
  Site. A cookie is a small piece of data transferred from a web site to the hard 
  drive of your computer so that the web site may track your activities on the 
  site. Web server logs allow us to count how many people visit our Web site and 
  also to evaluate our Site's visitor capacity. 
  </font><br><br>
<br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each 
  time you access our Site, our server may deliver certain customized information 
  to you based on the data stored in your cookies. Cookies allow us to determine 
  which areas and features of our Site are most popular by measuring user activity. 
  The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users as 
  they move from one page to another. Cookies let sites and advertisers "remember" 
  users across pages of a site and across multiple visits to a site. This allows 
  e-commerce and Internet advertising to: personalize features such as targeted 
  news stories, provide shopping sessions and quick navigation across multiple 
  zones of e-commerce sites, remember user names and passwords for future visits, 
  control ad frequency or the number of times a user sees a given ad, and deliver 
  advertisements targeted to a user's interests. Your computer may occasionally 
  receive cookies from our advertisers. PlattForm Advertising, Inc. does not control 
  these cookies, and they are not subject to our Privacy Policy. You can disable 
  cookies, but access to certain parts of our Web site may no longer be available 
  to you. 
  </font><br><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sharing 
  Information With Co-Brand Service Providers<br>
  </b>PlattForm Advertising, Inc. offers a number of third party services from 
  our Site. If you choose to use these optional services, we may provide some 
  of your personally identifiable information to the Co-Brand Service Provider 
  offering such services. Conversely, the Co-Brand Service Provider may provide 
  PlattForm Advertising, Inc. with personal information about you.<br>
  </font><br><br>
  
  <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sharing 
  Information With Affiliated Businesses, Strategic Partners, Subsidiaries, Advertisers, 
  And Other Third Parties<br>
  </font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may enter into 
  strategic marketing alliances with third parties, such as advertisers, businesses, 
  strategic partners and subsidiaries, who may be given access to personal information, 
  including your name, address, and email, for the purpose of providing you with 
  information about products and services that may be of interest to you. Advertisers 
  and other third parties may place cookies on your browser when you visit our 
  Site. PlattForm Advertising, Inc. has no control over what third parties do 
  with this information. Further, we cannot and do not make any representations 
  about the practices and policies of these companies.<br>
  Information Collected In Ad Delivery<br>
  </font><br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
  may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These 
  companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs 
  or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these 
  third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.<br>
  </font><br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Notice 
  Of New Services And Changes<br>
  </b>Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about 
  important changes to our Web site, new services, and special offers we think 
  you will find valuable.
  </font><br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>How 
  Do We Protect Your Information?<br>
  </b>We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality 
  of personal information we collect. This software provides a limited degree 
  of protection against unauthorized access or disclosure, as well as accidental 
  loss, alteration, or destruction.<br>
  </font><br><br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Do 
  We Comply With Legally Compelled Disclosure Of Information?<br>
  </b>We may release any private information about you that we possess when we 
  believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce or apply our 
  Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy and/or other agreements, or to protect 
  the rights, property or safety of PlattForm Advertising, Inc., our Site users, 
  or others.<br>
  </font><br><br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What 
  About Other Web Sites Linked to or from Our Web Site?<br>
  </b>The links in the Search4 family of web sites allow you to leave our Site. 
  Please be aware that once you leave our Site and enter another web site, or 
  use certain services provided through our Site, our Privacy Policy is no longer 
  in effect. Your browsing and interaction on web sites that have a link to our 
  Web site, or any links contained in a linked site, is subject to that web site's 
  own rules and policies. PlattForm Advertising, Inc. is not responsible for the 
  privacy practices employed by these sites, nor the information or content contained 
  therein. We provide these links to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion 
  of any link does not imply endorsement by PlattForm Advertising, Inc. of the 
  site. Please read over the rules and policies of these sites before proceeding.</font><p></p>
