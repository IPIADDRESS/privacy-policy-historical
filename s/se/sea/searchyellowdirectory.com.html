					<li>name</li>
					<li>contact information including email address</li>
					<li>demographic information such as postcode</li>
					<li>other information relevant to customer surveys and/or offers</li>

				<p>Note: Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us
					to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way
					gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data
					you choose to share with us. You may set your browser to refuse to accept cookies

                <div class="caption">Cookies and Google Adsense</div>
                <p>SearchYellowDirectory does not collect or store cookies. However we do use information collected by
                    the user browser to hold on to information, such as city and state location. This provides the user
                    with better targeted landing pages.
                    We do display Google Adsense which serves cookies to deliver its services, to personalize ads and to
                    analyze traffic. Information about your use of this site is shared with Google. As of May 25, 2018
                    there is a new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We have updated our privacy policies in
                    order to conform with the new regulations. By using this site, you agree to its use of cookies.</p>

                <div class="caption">When does AdSense send cookies to a browser?</div>
                <p>Google AdSense sends a cookie to the user's browser after any impression, click, or other activity
                    that results in a call to Google servers. If the browser accepts the cookie, the cookie is stored on
                    the browser. Most commonly, AdSense sends a cookie to the browser when a user visits a page that
                    shows Google ads. Pages with Google ads include ad tags that instruct browsers to request ad content
                    from Google servers. When the server delivers the ad content, it also sends a cookie. But a page
                    doesn’t have to show Google ads for this to happen; it just needs to include Adsense ad tags, which
                    might load a click tracker or impression pixel instead.
                    <a tarhet="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/7549925?hl=en">How does AdSense use cookies?</a></p>
