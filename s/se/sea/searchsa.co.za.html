<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>Last updated: 01 September 2014</p>
<div><hr align="left" size="2" width="97%"></div>
<p>Your privacy is of utmost importance to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. Our Privacy Policy is available on all the pages of Search SA |&nbsp;<a href="http://searchsa.co.za/">http://searchsa.co.za/</a></p>
<p>Please read the following carefully. If you have any questions or concerns, please send us an e-mail, for attention The Search Master, at this&nbsp;<a href="mailto:help@searchsa.co.za?subject=Questions%20regarding%20the%20Privacy%20Policy%20of%20Search%20SA">email</a>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Search SA Gather and Use Information</h2>
<p>Search SA&nbsp;will never wilfully disclose any personally identifiable information about our online audience to any third party without first receiving the user’s permission. We do not collect personally identifiable information from our visitors other than what is supplied to us on a voluntary basis via online web forms.</p>
<p>Visitors to the&nbsp;Search SA&nbsp;may voluntarily supply certain personally identifiable information in connection with (i) contest registration, (ii) subscription registration for sites or services which require subscription (such as email newsletters), (iii) requests for membership information and (iv) transactions that may require personally identifiable information. In addition, personally identifiable information is voluntarily provided in connection with certain content submissions, vehicle listings, comments and suggestions, or voting.</p>
<p>Some of our sites contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites’ privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>
<p>Search SA&nbsp;may use such information only for conducting the activities stated above, for internal marketing and promotional purposes, or, on occasion, when mailing lists are made available to other organizations. (The occasional provision of mailing lists to such organizations is the only case where such information would be provided to business partners of Search SA).</p>
<p>If the visitor does not want this information collected and used by us for the disclosed internal purposes, the visitor is given an opportunity to ‘opt-out.’ Our visitors need to recognize, however, that under certain circumstances, if they select to ‘opt-out’ they may not be eligible for certain activities or services for which the personally identifiable information is needed. (For example, when a new vehicle listing is added)</p>
<p>Acceptance of these Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions | Search SA&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using this site, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this&nbsp;<a href="http://searchsa.co.za/">Search SA</a>&nbsp;– SA’s Local Search Engine / Web Site Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use the site. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or&nbsp;remove portions of this policy at any time.</p>
<p>Updates to this privacy policy may occur from time to time and we will notify you about material changes in the way we treat personally identifiable information by placing a notice on our site. We encourage you to periodically check back and review this policy so that you always will know what information we collect, how we use it, and to whom we disclose it. Your continued use of&nbsp;<a href="http://searchsa.co.za/" target="_blank">Search SA</a>, following the posting of any changes to these terms shall mean that you have accepted those changes.</p>
<p>Please submit any questions or concerns about this privacy policy to The Search Master by going to our&nbsp;<a href="http://searchsa.co.za/help" target="_blank">HELP FORUM</a></p>
<h2>PRIVACY POLICY (in a nutshell)</h2>
<p>Any information provided by our customers will only be used as our customers direct. We do not disclose any personally identifiable information to any third party unless we have your permission. The only case where personal information would be shared, is for marketing purposes or internal use to business partners. Our website disclaimer and privacy policy are subject to change over time. Please return periodically to review the latest on our commitments to you.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: The Search SA | Print-Index Privacy Policy has been updated. Please review the updated privacy policy carefully before using any of the Search SA Web Sites. By using any of the Search SA Web Sites, you consent to the terms of the updated privacy policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Search SA ("Part of the Print-Index SA Group of Companies / Websites) is committed to protecting your privacy. Search SA, its affiliates, and its subsidiaries own, operate, or provide access to, several interactive web sites and other interactive features that provide an authorized link to this Privacy Policy (collectively "Search SA Web Sites"). This Privacy Policy applies only to the Search SA Web Sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Privacy Policy describes, among other things, the types of information collected about you when you visit a Search SA Web Site; how your information may be used and when it may be disclosed; how you can control the use and disclosure of your information; and how your information is protected. Trust is a cornerstone of our mission at Search SA. We are committed to gaining and maintaining your trust by following a core set of Privacy Principles:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Scope of Privacy Policy</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Privacy Policy applies to information, including contact information, collected about you by a Search SA Web Site. This Privacy Policy does not cover any information collected through any other web site. Please note that some Search SA Web Sites may contain links to non-Search SA Web Sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites, and we recommend that you visit the privacy policies of each web site that you visit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Information Collected</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">• In limited circumstances, payment and identity verification information, such as credit card number, social security number or comparable national identifiers, and driver's license number where needed for payment, to complete a particular transaction, or to access a particular service (e.g., contests or paid subscriptions);</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Contact information about others when you provide information about others or refer a friend to a particular site or service (note: such information is used solely to facilitate the communications requested);</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Information posted in community discussions and other interactive online features;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Correspondence you send to us; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Information collected about you offline (including via facsimile, mail, or in person for sweepstakes entrance forms).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Information we collect automatically on Search SA Web Sites. Search SA Web Sites may collect certain information automatically, including:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Your browser type and operating system;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">• Upon request, your bandwidth speed and information about the software programs installed on your computer; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Standard server log information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Information we obtain from other sources. Where permitted by applicable law, we may collect information about you from other sources, including through interactive applications (such as mobile devices, third-party services, and embedded audio and video players), from co-branded partners and sites (for example, on our pages on Facebook / Twitter), and from commercially available sources (such as data aggregators and public databases). The following are examples of information we may collect from other sources:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Name, postal address, and telephone number;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Demographic data, such as age, gender, and income level;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• If you access third-party services (such as Facebook, Google or Twitter) through a Search SA Web Site, or if you access a Search SA Web Site via a third-party service, your username and password for those services and other information available about or collected from you on those services, as described in our overview of third-party social networking services</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Your interests and purchase behavior;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Publicly-observed data, such as activities on blogs, videos, and other online postings; and</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This privacy policy does not cover the practices of third parties, including those that may disclose information to Search SA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Combining Information. Please note that all of the information we collect about you may be combined, including to help us tailor our communications to you and to develop rich online content and services across the Search SA Web Sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Use of Information</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We only use payment and identity verification information, such as credit card numbers, driver's license numbers, social security numbers, or comparable national identifiers as necessary for completing a particular transaction or fulfilling a service (e.g., paid subscriptions or awarding prizes to contest winners) or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We generally use other information we collect about you to:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Fulfill your requests for products, services, and information, including to send you electronic newsletters, authorize a purchase, and complete a transaction that you have requested;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Enable you to participate in features such as surveys, polls, sweepstakes, and message boards;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Provide you with electronic newsletters, information, special offers and promotional materials on behalf of Search SA Web Sites, companies within our corporate family, and third parties, in accordance with applicable law;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Analyze the use of Search SA Web Sites and information about visitors to our Web Sites to understand and improve our service offerings and, in accordance with our sharing policies, discussed below, to produce anonymous or aggregated data and statistics that might help third parties develop their own products and service offerings;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Customize the content you see when you visit a Search SA Web Site;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities and otherwise in accordance with Search SA's Terms of Use; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• For any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or pursuant to your consent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. Disclosure of Information</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Search SA is committed to maintaining your trust and we want you to understand when and with whom we may share information collected about you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• With your consent. With your consent, we may share your contact information with internal business partners. For example, Search SA Web Sites such as www.printindex.co.za and printindex.webs.com offer free access to relevant services (e.g., webcasts and white papers) if you agree to have your information shared with third parties so they can contact you about related products and services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Authorized third-party service providers. We share your information with third-party vendors who help us with specialized services, including customer support, email and text message deployment, business analytics, marketing, and data processing.
