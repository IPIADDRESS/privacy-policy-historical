<h2><b>How Search SA Gather and Use Information</b></h2>
<p>Search SA will never wilfully disclose any personally identifiable information about our online audience to any third party without first receiving the user’s permission. We do not collect personally identifiable information from our visitors other than what is supplied to us on a voluntary basis via online web forms.</p>
<p>Visitors to the Search SA may voluntarily supply certain personally identifiable information in connection with (i) contest registration, (ii) subscription registration for sites or services which require subscription (such as email newsletters), (iii) requests for membership information and (iv) transactions that may require personally identifiable information. In addition, personally identifiable information is voluntarily provided in connection with certain content submissions, vehicle listings, comments and suggestions, or voting.</p>
<p>Some of our sites contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites’ privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>
<p>Search SA may use such information only for conducting the activities stated above, for internal marketing and promotional purposes, or, on occasion, when mailing lists are made available to other organizations. (The occasional provision of mailing lists to such organizations is the only case where such information would be provided to business partners of Search SA).</p>
<p>If the visitor does not want this information collected and used by us for the disclosed internal purposes, the visitor is given an opportunity to ‘opt-out.’ Our visitors need to recognize, however, that under certain circumstances, if they select to ‘opt-out’ they may not be eligible for certain activities or services for which the personally identifiable information is needed. (For example, when a new vehicle listing is added)</p>

<p>Updates to this privacy policy may occur from time to time and we will notify you about material changes in the way we treat personally identifiable information by placing a notice on our site.

<h2><b>PRIVACY POLICY (in a nutshell)</b></h2>
<p>Any information provided by our customers will only be used as our customers direct. We do not disclose any personally identifiable information to any third party unless we have your permission. The only case where personal information would be shared, is for marketing purposes or internal use to business partners. Our website disclaimer and privacy policy are subject to change over time. Please return periodically to review the latest on our commitments to you.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">• Name, postal address, and telephone number;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Demographic data, such as age, gender, and income level;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Use of Information</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We only use payment and identity verification information, such as credit card numbers, driver's license numbers, social security numbers, or comparable national identifiers as necessary for completing a particular transaction or fulfilling a service (e.g., paid subscriptions or awarding prizes to contest winners) or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We generally use other information we collect about you to:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Fulfill your requests for products, services, and information, including to send you electronic newsletters, authorize a purchase, and complete a transaction that you have requested;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Enable you to participate in features such as surveys, polls, sweepstakes, and message boards;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Provide you with electronic newsletters, information, special offers and promotional materials on behalf of Search SA Web Sites, companies within our corporate family, and third parties, in accordance with applicable law;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Analyze the use of Search SA Web Sites and information about visitors to our Web Sites to understand and improve our service offerings and, in accordance with our sharing policies, discussed below, to produce anonymous or aggregated data and statistics that might help third parties develop their own products and service offerings;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Customize the content you see when you visit a Search SA Web Site;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities and otherwise in accordance with Search SA's Terms of Use; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• For any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or pursuant to your consent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. Disclosure of Information</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Search SA is committed to maintaining your trust and we want you to understand when and with whom we may share information collected about you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• With your consent. With your consent, we may share your contact information with internal business partners. For example, Search SA Web Sites such as www.printindex.co.za and printindex.webs.com offer free access to relevant services (e.g., webcasts and white papers) if you agree to have your information shared with third parties so they can contact you about related products and services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Authorized third-party service providers. We share your information with third-party vendors who help us with specialized services, including customer support, email and text message deployment, business analytics, marketing, and data processing. These third parties are allowed to use your information to help us provide our services and not for any other purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Sweepstakes, contests, or promotions. When you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the promotions, your information may be disclosed to sponsors and third parties who help design, administer and implement the promotion, including in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment and aggregated data analysis. Your information also may be disclosed as required by law, such as on a winners list. Also, by entering a promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, including allowing the sponsors to use your name, voice, and likeness in advertising and marketing associated with the promotion in accordance with applicable law. All terms applicable to the particular promotion will be made available to you at the time you enter the promotion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Co-Branded Partners. Co-Branded Partners are third parties with whom a Search SA Web Site may jointly offer a service or feature. You can tell when you are accessing a service offered by a Co-Branded Partner because the Co-Branded Partner's name will be featured prominently. You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a service offered by a Co-Branded Partner. In doing so, you may be providing your information to both us and the Co-Branded Partner, or we may share your information with the Co-Branded Partner. Please note that the Co-Branded Partner's privacy policy may apply to its use of your information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Search SA Web Sites and other CBS businesses. The Search SA family continues to grow to include innovative Search SA Web Sites that offer rich and deep interactive experiences. Where permitted by law, we may share information we collect about you within the family or Group of Companies, Corporation, our parent company, and other Search SA-affiliated companies, so we can provide you with information about products and services that might interest you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Business transfers. We may share your information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of a Search SA Web Site, a merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Legal requirements. We may disclose information about our users, including contact information, to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal press, and other law enforcement measures, and to comply with other legal obligations, such as our FCC requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Protect our Web Sites and users. We may disclose information to protect and defend the legal rights, interests, and safety of Search SA Web Sites, other Print-Index SA companies, and their employees, agents, and contractors (including enforcing our agreements); to protect the safety and security of users of the Web Sites and members of the public; and as otherwise disclosed in our Terms of Use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. Your Choices</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can choose to enjoy content and features on Search SA Web Sites without directly providing us with any information about you; however, as described above, some information may automatically be collected or may be requested so you can take advantage of certain features and services offered on Search SA Web Sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can opt out of receiving commercial email or text messages from a particular Search SA Web Site or service by following the instructions contained in any such message. Please note that even if you unsubscribe to commercial messages, we still may need to send you communications relating to your use of the Search SA Web Sites, such as service announcements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You also have choices about whether cookies and other similar technologies are placed on your computer or mobile device.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You also may choose to opt out of our use of data that we collect about your visits to our business partners’ sites to customize advertising that we serve.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. Access</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you choose to share contact information with us, you may have the opportunity to update that information on a Search SA Web Site. You also may update or amend your information by contacting us. If you ask us to shut down your account or delete your information, we will disable your account within a reasonable period of time. Please note that we may need to retain some information about you in order to satisfy our legal and security obligations. For example, some of your information may remain in back-up storage even if you ask us to delete it. In some cases, you may be entitled under local laws to access or object to the processing of information that we hold relating to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7. Protection of Information</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are committed to protecting your information. We have adopted commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and physical procedures to help protect your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, and alteration. Please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We want you to feel confident using Search SA Web Sites but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8. Third Party Sites</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you select a link to a third party web site from one of the Search SA Web Sites (for example, if you link to First National Bank in order to pay for a product or service offered by a Search SA Web Site), you will be leaving the Search SA Site. Any information that you disclose on the third party site will be governed by that site's privacy policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and service offerings. If we modify our Privacy Policy, we will update the "Effective Date" (found at the top of this page) and such changes will be effective upon posting. If we make any material changes in the way we use your information, we will notify you by sending an email message to the email address you most recently provided to us or by prominently posting a notice of the changes on Search SA Web Sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10. Questions</p>
