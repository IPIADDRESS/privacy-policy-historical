        <strong>What Personal Information Does Planet Ocean Gather?</strong>
    </p>

    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">

        <p>
            The information we gather helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at all of Planet
            Ocean's domains. Here are the types of information we gather.
        </p>

        <ul>

            <li><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> We receive and store any information you enter on one of our
                Web sites or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you
                might not be able to utilize some of the features. We use the information that you provide for such
                purposes as responding to your requests, customizing your transactions with us, improving our sites, and
                communicating with you.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Automatic Information:</strong> We receive and store certain types of information whenever you
                interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use <a href="#whatcookies"><em>cookies</em></a>,
                and we obtain
                <a href="#autoinfo" style="text-decoration: underline;">certain types of information</a> when your Web
                browser accesses our membership sites.
            </li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <a name="whatcookies" id="whatcookies"></a>

    <p>
        <strong>What About Cookies?</strong>
    </p>

    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">

        <ul>

            <li>Cookies are identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to
                enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide personalized features.
            </li>

            <li>The <em>Help</em> portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from
                accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
                disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of Planet Ocean
                membership sites' coolest features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.

        <strong>Does Planet Ocean Share the Information It Receives?</strong>
    </p>

    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">

        <p>
            Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of
            selling it to others. However there may be instances where we are required by law or other mandate to share
            information in such cases as:
        </p>

        <ul>

            <li><strong>Protection of Planet Ocean and Others:</strong> We release account and other personal
                information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our
                Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Planet Ocean, our
                users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud
                protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting,
                sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial
                purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
            </li>

            <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when
                information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share
                the information.
            </li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <a name="howsecure" id="howsecure"></a>

    <p>
        <strong>What About Information Security?</strong>
    </p>

    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">

        <ul>

            <li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer
                (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
            </li>

            <li>We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we
                transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
            </li>

            <li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be
                sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
            </li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <a name="whatparties" id="whatparties"></a>

    <p>
        <strong>What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?</strong>
    </p>

    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">

        <p>
            SearchEngineNews.com may include third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any
            personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites.
        </p>

        <p>
            These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf,
            sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our website directly to your
            browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies,
            JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure
            the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control
            over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and
            third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more
            information about their privacy practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful
            information about Internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"),
            including information about how to opt-out of their information collection.

    <p>
        <strong>Which Information Can I Access?</strong>
    </p>

    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">

        <p>
            If you choose to enroll as a member to any of our sites, you will be provided the means to view and change
            any personal information stored with us.

    <p>
        <strong>What Choices Do I Have?</strong>
    </p>

    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">

        <ul>

            <li>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information although doing so might prevent you
                from becoming a member, completing a transaction, or utilizing a feature or function of Planet Ocean's
                membership sites.
            </li>

            <li>If you become a member of <em>SearchEngineNews.com</em>, you can add or update certain information on
                your personalized page within our Membership Center. When you update information, we usually keep a copy
                of the prior version for our records.
            </li>

            <li>The <em>Help</em> portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from
                accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
                disable cookies altogether.

            For example, you provide information when you place an order through SearchEngineNews.com. You provide
            information in <em>Your Customer Profile</em> - and you might have more than one if you have used more than
            one e-mail address when shopping with us - whenever you communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise,
            and whenever you login using your e-mail address and password.

                times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as
                scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.
