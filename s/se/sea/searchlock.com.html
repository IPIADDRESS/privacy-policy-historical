					<h4>SearchLock Product Overview</h4>
					<p>
						SearchLock is a browser extension and search engine that helps you protect 
						your privacy by preventing logging of your keywords as you search the web. 
						SearchLock is available for users of Chrome and Firefox.
					</p>
						
					<p>How Does SearchLock Keep Me Safe?</p>
					<p>
						SearchLock uses a patent-pending process to detect when your browser is about to send your search query to a search engine which does not respect your privacy and re-routes it to SearchLock's privacy-enhanced search results page which keeps your privacy safe. 
						You can read more about how SearchLock protects you here. 
						Please note: SearchLock serves web results for the whole web. 
						As a result, you may see adult-oriented search results when the “Filter” feature is off.
					</p>

					<p>Which Search Engines does SearchLock Work With?</p>
					<p>SearchLock currently protects you from being tracked by intercepting searches at Google, Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search.</p>
					
					<h4>SearchLock Privacy - The Quick Summary:</h4>
					<p>The SearchLock search engine and extension do not store or collect any <a href="#pii">personally identifiable information</a>.</p>
					
					<h4>The More Detailed Version:</h4>
					<p>
						SearchLock takes protecting the privacy of our users very seriously.
						This privacy policy outlines the limited and non-personal information the
						SearchLock Extension and SearchLock.com ("SearchLock") may gather, and our
						disclosure policy.
					</p>
					
					<h4>
						SearchLock Does Not Know Who You Are
					</h4>
					
					<p>	
						Unlike most search engines, SearchLock does not record your IP address or full User Agent string on our servers.
						This means that we do not record your searches in a way that could identify you or be traced back to you. 
					</p>
					
					<h4>We Do Not Collect or Store Personal Information</h4>
					
					<p>
						When you search at other search engines, your search query is usually saved along with information that can identify you such as information about your computer (like your user agent string or IP address), the date and exact time of your search, and your account information if you are signed in (such as your email address and name).
					</p>
					<p>
						SearchLock takes the approach of not storing search queries together with any identifiers. In other words, we can't trace your searches back to you nor tie your searches together.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Data We Collect</h4>
					<p>
						We do collect a limited amount of non-personal information and review it in aggregate (i.e. summary graphs) to help us improve our service. This information is NOT tied to anything that could identify you personally.
						This information includes your basic details about your web browser (type and version),
						operating system, from where you initially heard about SearchLock (for example: Facebook),
						a numerical count of how many searches, ad clicks, and result clicks are performed daily
						(we don't record which result or ad is clicked, just that a click event occurred), search terms
						(logged without any identifying information about you or your computing device whatsoever, used to improve our search results),
						and the date you installed SearchLock. Again, none of this information can be used to identify you in any
						way nor be tied back to you.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Data Collected by SearchLock's Advertising Partners and Affiliate Relationships</h4>
					
					<p>
						In order to fund the operational costs of SearchLock we display advertisements within our search results. SearchLock carefully selected our adverting partner to ensure that they comply with our privacy principles. The search term you enter is encrypted and passed to the advertising partner that powers our sponsored search results in order to return interest-based advertisements. They take additional steps to ensure that the data collected are not associated with personally identifiable information. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Furthermore, we have a contractual agreement with our advertising partner that they will not request and we will not share any personally identifiable information.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						We also maintain affiliate relationships with merchants such as Amazon and eBay and e-commerce affiliate networks. These relationships enable SearchLock to earn commissions when you make purchases after clicking through to their sites. We do not share search terms or personally identifiable information with these merchants or e-commerce affiliate networks.
					</p>
					
					
					<h4>What Constitutes Personally Identifiable Information?</h4>
					
					<p>
						We define personally identifiable information as information that can be used on its own to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify you as an individual. While the SearchLock extension and search engine do not collect your IP or full user agent information, this information is collected by our advertising partner for the purposes of ensuring that the sponsored ads are relevant and for preventing click fraud. To that end, our advertising partner takes additional steps so that data collected and used to customize interest-based advertising are not associated with personally identifiable information.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Cookies</h4>
					
					<p>
						Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent and saved to your computer's hard drive when visiting sites. SearchLock uses two non-identifying cookies. The first is called 'settings' and it saves the state of the adult content filter and any other display settings.
						The other is from get.searchlock.com and it helps us determine where users like you are found out about us
						(i.e. An advertisement for SearchLock on Facebook). Neither of these cookies are associated
						with your search activity in any way.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our advertising partner may also place or recognize a cookie (named BX).  This cookie is used in connection with their ad serving and quality systems. Our advertising partner takes additional steps so that data collected and used to customize interest-based advertising are not associated with personally identifiable information.
					</p>
					<p>
						We have a contractual agreement with our advertising partner that they will not request and we will not share any personally identifiable information.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can choose to accept or refuse cookies by changing the settings of your browser. It is also usually possible to only accept cookies from selected sites.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a search engine and extension, and as an advertising publisher, we have various links on our site, including but not limited to search
						results and sponsored results. The SearchLock extension or search engine may also
						redirect your queries to DuckDuckGo.com or StartPage.com (other privacy-minded search providers) if the SearchLock service is offline or unavailable for any reason.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Information Collected During Use of HelpDesk &amp; Community Areas</h4>
					<p>
						In regards to the personal information submitted to us during use of our helpdesk and community areas, we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Additionally, we promise to never associate this information with your search behavior or usage of our extension.
					</p>
					
					<h4>SearchLock Will Not Sell or Disclose Your Contact Information to Any Third Parties</h4>
					
					<p>
						When you send comments, questions, suggestions, or feedback to SearchLock via email or within our Community Area or helpdesk, and include an email address and/or contact information SearchLock may use this information to respond to you.
						SearchLock will not sell or disclose your contact information to any third parties.
						We may, however, occasionally send emails to community users with SearchLock company news.
						This service is opt-in and always includes the option to unsubscribe.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						If you would like access to your personal information to correct, update, or delete it, please contact us by emailing support@searchlock.com or by mailing your request the contact information found below.
					</p>
					
					<h4>SearchLock.com is for Users Age 18+</h4>
					
					<p>
						Even though SearchLock does not collect personally identifiable information during your use of the search engine and extension,
						SearchLock.com is for users age eighteen (18) and above due to the potential for adult-related links and/or content to appear in our results when the "Filter" feature is turned off.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h4>
					
					<p>
						We may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes 
						in the way we use your personal information, we will notify you by posting a 
						notification on our search results pages for your acceptance. 
						Use of SearchLock after such an update and notification constitutes your acceptance 
						of the modified policy.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Should You Wish to Uninstall SearchLock</h4>
					<p>
						If you would like to uninstall or disable the SearchLock extension, please follow the instructions outlined on this page: <a href="https://www.searchlock.com/pages/uninstall" target="_blank">https://www.searchlock.com/pages/uninstall</a>.
					</p>
					
					<h4>About this Privacy Policy and Compliance With the Law</h4>
					
					<p>
						SearchLock is headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. Any request or demand from any government will be thoroughly checked by our attorneys,
						and we will not comply unless a law which applies to us would undeniably require us to do so.
						SearchLock is owned and operated by BeeStripe LLC, PO BOX 22986, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.
						The representative of this Privacy Policy is Ciaran Thompson, COO of BeeStripe LLC.
					</p>

					<p><strong>Special Notice to Safari Browser Users</strong></p>

					
<p>
Due to limitations in Safari's extension API, SearchLock is unable to block search suggestions, 
which may expose your search terms to your default search engine and/or Apple. 
You may turn these off manually by following these <a href="/pages/safari" target="_blank">instructions</a>.
