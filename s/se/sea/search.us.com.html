<h2>Our Privacy Policy</h2>
<hr>

<h3>What information do we collect?</h3>

<p>We collect information from you when you use our site, navigate around our site, register on our site, subscribe to our newsletter, respond to a survey or fill out a form. </p>

<p>When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name or e-mail address. You may, however, visit our site anonymously.</p>

<h3>Search.us.com Toolbar</h3>

<p>Upon removal, the Search.us.com toolbar can ask if you would like to reset your browsers to their "factory" default settings. Choosing "Yes" restores your browsers to their original configurations specified by the publishers of the browser software. Any resemblance to your personal browser settings is purely coincidental. This feature does not save your personal browser settings.</p>

<h3>What do we use your information for?</h3>

<p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways: </p>
<ul>

(we continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you)</li>
<li> To provide targeted advertisements. </li>
</ul>

<p>Yes. Cookies are small files that sites and service providers may transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser. They enable the site and service provider systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. You can turn off cookies in your settings at any time.</p>

<p>We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits, keep track of advertisements and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.</p>
<p>We may user Cookies to provide a targeted advertising experience on and off our site.</p>


<h3>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</h3>

<p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties.

We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or other's rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
