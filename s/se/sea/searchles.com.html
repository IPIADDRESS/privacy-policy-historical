<h3>What Personal Information About Users Does Searchles Collect?</h3>
<p class="first">Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience.  We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website.  We do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with the purpose for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by you.  We collect the following types of information from our users:</p>
<ol class="misc">
<li>Information You Provide to Us:<br>

We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.

<ul class="misc">
<li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us.  Searchles automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Searchles cookie information, and the page you requested.  Searchles uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.</li>
<li>Social sharing of data:  Searchles allows other users to browse stories that you have dugg, submitted, blogged, or commented on.  This information is made available via your member profile (Searchles.com/users/username), on the Searchles spy page (Searchles.com/spy) or within the permalink URL of the story in which you performed the action on. Searchles may choose to post this data on other site features in the future.</li>
<li>Profile information:  Searchles allows other users to browse your full name, location, and instant messaging URL, within your member profile should you provide this optional information.</li>
<li>Syndication: Searchles allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public content within the website.</li>

<h3>What About Cookies?</h3>

<li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people.  Searchles cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is. </li>
<li>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies.  We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Searchles's most attractive features.</li>
