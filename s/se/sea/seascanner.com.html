The protection of your personal data is very important
        to us. We want you to feel safe and certain when visiting our website.</p><p class="pb5">Like every EU company, we are bound by the legal provisions on data protection. In the following paragraphs, we would
        like to explain to you how we comply with these provisions.</p></div><h4>Entity processing the data</h4><div class="gradientGray pt10 pr10 pb10 pl10 mb10"><p class="pb5">The travel agency behind Seascanner.com is Kreuzfahrtberater GmbH, who serves as the entity processing the data and whose
        contact details you can find
        <a href="/company-details" title="Seascanner.com contact">here</a>.</p></div><h4>Extent of processing of personal data</h4><div class="gradientGray pt10 pr10 pb10 pl10 mb10"><p class="pb5">In principle, we process personal data of our users only insofar as this is necessary to provide a functioning website,
        and our content and services. The processing of personal data of our users takes place regularly, only with the consent
        of the user. An exception applies to cases in which prior consent cannot be obtained for reasons of fact, and the
        processing of the data is permitted by law.
    </p></div><h4>What personal information is collected?</h4><div class="gradientGray pt10 pr10 pb10 pl10 mb10"><ul><li class="pb5">For a consultation request, please provide your e-mail address or telephone number. We need this information in order
            to contact you.</li><li class="pb5">When making a booking request, we also need your address and the names and dates of birth of the travelers. These
            data are necessary for the proper processing of your booking. If the tour operator requires the nationality of
            the traveler to create an option booking, we will ask for it directly in the booking form.</li><li class="pb5">Depending on the payment method, your account number and bank code (if paying by direct debit) or your credit card
            details are required for a fixed booking. When paying by invoice, you do not have to submit any payment details
            to us.</li><li class="pb5">After a fixed booking and before departure, the tour operators require the entry of the passport details (name, nationality,
            passport number, date of issue, expiry date, issuing authority, place of issue) for the creation of the “on-board
            manifesto” which must be made available to the immigration authorities of the countries visited. These data can
            be sent by you directly to the tour operator, but we will also take over the forwarding of these data for you
            if you so wish.</li><li class="pb5">We process usage data (e.g. the visited web pages of our online offering, interest in the cruises and package tours
            offered) and content data (e.g. entries in the contact form or user profile) for advertising purposes in a user
            profile. We use this, for example, to display product information to the user based on the services the user
            has previously used.
        </li></ul><h5>Server log files</h5><p class="pb5">In addition, we log all accesses to our server for the purpose of fault diagnosis. This data is also used to optimize
        the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. For this purpose, the following data,
        which your Internet browser transmits to us or to our web hosting provider, is recorded:

        </p><ul><li class="pb5">Browser type and version</li><li class="pb5">Operating system used</li><li class="pb5">Website from which you visit us (Referrer URL)</li><li class="pb5">Address of the website you visit</li><li class="pb5">Date and time of your access</li><li class="pb5">Your Internet Protocol (IP) address.</li></ul>

        The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.<p></p><p class="pb5">The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is essential for the
        operation of the website. There is consequently no right of objection to this on the part of the user.</p><h5>Cookies</h5><p class="pb5">Like many other websites, we use so-called cookies on our site to recognize multiple uses of our offer by the same user
        / Internet browser. Cookies are small text files that your Internet browser stores and saves on your computer. They
        serve to optimize our website and our offers and to facilitate your access to our site. Cookies help us:
        </p><ul><li class="pb5">To estimate our visitor numbers and to estimate the frequency of use of our offer,</li><li class="pb5">Store information about your preferences so that we can tailor the page to your needs and show you more relevant
                content,</li><li class="pb5">To process your search queries faster,</li><li class="pb5">To recognize when you return to our website.</li></ul><p></p><p class="pb5">You can prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser accordingly. Already saved cookies can be deleted at any
        time. This can also be done automatically. We do need to point out to you, however, that you may not be able to use
        all the features of our website if you disable or delete cookies.</p><p class="pb5">In order for us to be able to display the appropriate prices when you display a cruise or package tour detail page, the
        following information is stored in a cookie on your computer:</p><ul><li class="pb5">Number of adults (1,2,3,4)</li><li class="pb5">Number of children (0,1,2,3)</li><li class="pb5">Currency</li></ul><p class="pb5">You can also use our website if you disable cookies. In this case, you only have to re-enter the number of adults / children
        and the currency when displaying each cruise or package tour detail page.</p></div><h4>Rechtsgrundlagen</h4><div class="gradientGray pt10 pr10 pb10 pl10 mb10"><ul><li class="pb5">Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing of personal data, the legal basis is Art. 6 para.
            1 lit. a EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</li><li class="pb5">In the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party,
            Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR is the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations required to carry out
            pre-contractual actions.</li><li class="pb5">Insofar as processing of personal data is required to fulfill a legal obligation that our company is subject to,
            the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR.</li><li class="pb5">In the event that the essential interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of
            personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d GDPR is the legal basis.</li><li class="pb5">If processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or a third party, and if the interests,
            fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail over the first interest, Art. 6 para. 1 lit.
            f GDPR is the legal basis for processing.</li></ul></div><h4>Data transmission to third parties</h4><div class="gradientGray pt10 pr10 pb10 pl10 mb10"><p class="pb5">If we pass on data to other persons and companies (processors or third parties), transmit them to them or otherwise grant
        them access to the data, this is done only on the basis of: a legal permission (eg if a transmission of data to third
        parties according to Art. 6 para 1 letter b GDPR is required to fulfill the contract), your consent, a legal obligation
        or on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. the use of agents, web hosting, etc.).</p><p class="pb5">Insofar as we commission third parties to process data on the basis of a contract processing contract, this is done on
        the basis of Art. 28 GDPR.</p><p class="pb5">When traveling to the United States, local authorities require that each passenger's flight and reservation details be
        inspected prior to entry. Without this data transmission by the tour operator an entry into the USA is not possible.
        Similar rules may apply to other states.</p><h5>Transfers to other countries</h5><p class="pb5">If we process data in another country (ie outside the EU), or transmit data in the context of the use of third party
        services or disclosure, this is only done to fulfill our (pre) contractual obligations, on the basis of your consent,
        due to a legal obligation, or based on our legitimate interests. Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we
        process or have the data processed in a third country only in the presence of the special conditions of Art. 44 et
        seq. GDPR. The processing is on the basis of specific guarantees, such as the officially recognized level of data
        protection (eg for the US through the “Privacy Shield”) or compliance with officially recognized special contractual
        obligations (so-called "standard contractual clauses").</p><h5>Use of Shariff for share buttons</h5><p>On our website we use the privacy-friendly solution "Shariff" for the social media "share" buttons. The usual social
        media buttons transfer your data to Facebook &amp; others with every page request and provide the social networks with
        exact information about your surfing behavior (user tracking). You do not have to be logged in, or be a member of
        the network. By contrast, the Shariff button used by us does not establish direct contact between the social network
        and visitors until you actively click on the share button. This will prevent Shariff from leaving a digital trail
        when you visit our site and therefore improves your privacy.</p><h5>Use of the "Like" or "Share" buttons</h5><p>On our site you can share content directly on the respective social network (hereinafter: service) by clicking on the
        Facebook / Twitter / Google + Share button. You can recognize the share buttons by the logo of the respective service

        is done using automated procedures.</p><p class="pb5">In exercising this right, you also have the right to require that your personal data are transmitted directly from one
        person to another, insofar as this is technically feasible. Freedoms and rights of other persons cannot be affected
        by this.
    </p><p class="pb5">The right to data portability does not apply to the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a task
        in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority delegated to the controller.</p><h5>Right to object</h5><p class="pb5">You have the right at any time, for reasons that arise from your particular situation, to object against the processing
        of your personal data pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these
        provisions.</p><p class="pb5">The controller will no longer process the personal data concerning you unless he can demonstrate compelling legitimate
        grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the purpose of
        enforcing, exercising or defending legal claims.</p><p class="pb5">If the personal data relating to you are processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any
        time to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of such advertising; this also applies to profiling
        insofar as it is associated with such direct mail.</p><p class="pb5">If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, your personal data will no longer be processed for these purposes.</p><p class="pb5">Regardless of Directive 2002/58 / EC, you have the option, in the context of the use of information society services,
        of exercising your right to object through automated procedures that use technical specifications.</p><h5>Right to revoke the data protection consent declaration</h5><p class="pb5">You have the right to revoke your data protection declaration at any time. The revocation of consent does not affect
        the legality of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation.</p><h5>Automated decision on an individual basis including profiling</h5><p class="pb5">You have the right not to be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing - including profiling - that
        will have legal effect or will affect you in a similar manner. This does not apply if the decision:</p><ol><li class="pb5">is required for the conclusion or performance of a contract between you and the controller,</li><li class="pb5">is permissible on the basis of Union or Member State legislation to which the controller is subject, and that legislation
            contains adequate measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and your legitimate interests, or</li><li class="pb5">with your express consent.</li></ol><p class="pb5">However, these decisions must not be applied to special categories of personal data under Art. 9 (1) GDPR, unless Art.
        9 (2) lit. a or g GDPR applies and reasonable measures have been taken to protect the rights and freedoms as well
        as your legitimate interests.</p><p class="pb5">With regard to the cases referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 above, the person responsible shall take reasonable steps
        to uphold your rights and freedoms and your legitimate interests, including at least the right to obtain the intervention
        of a person from the controller, to express your own position and to challenge the decision.
    </p><h5>Right to complain to a supervisory authority</h5><p class="pb5">Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you shall have the right to complain to a supervisory
        authority, in particular in the Member State of your residence, place of work or the place of alleged infringement,
        if you believe that the processing of the personal data concerning you violates GDPR.</p><p class="pb5">The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been submitted shall inform the complainant of the status and results
        of the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to Article 78 of the GDPR.</p></div></div><div id="footer"><div id="footer-shariff" class="shariff" data-theme="white" data-backend-url="https://shariff.kreuzfahrtberater.de/" data-mail-url="mailto:" data-lang="en"></div><ul id="footer-navigation"><li><a href="/terms-conditions" title="Terms and Conditions" rel="nofollow">Terms &amp; Conditions</a></li><li><a href="/faq" title="Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a></li><li><a href="/company-details" title="Address and Contact Information" rel="nofollow">Contact</a></li><li><a href="/data-privacy" title="Privacy for your data" rel="nofollow">Privacy Policy</a></li></ul><div id="footer-copyright"><span>© 2019 seascanner.com</span></div></div></div><div id="emailSignup"><button class="close"><i class="icon icon-close"></i><span class="text">Close</span></button><div class="heading">Looking for the best deals, exciting news and helpful tips from cruise experts?</div><div class="info">
