			Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your 
			experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, 
			and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, 
			tools, and opportunities with complete confidence.<br>
			<br>
			We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm 
			commitment to privacy and security. 'This Privacy Policy describes 
			how our company collects information from all end users of our 
			Internet services (the "Services")-those who access some of our 
			Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors') as well as those who 
			may purchase Products and/or pay a monthly service fee to subscribe 
			to the Service ("Members")-what we do with the information we 
			collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the 
			collection and use of such information. We request that you read 
			this Privacy Policy carefully.<br>

			<p align="justify"><font color="#000066" face="Arial, verdana, Tahoma" style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight:300"><b>Introduction: </b>Our company collects information 
			in different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various 
			parts of our Services and the network of Web sites accessible 
			through our Service. We use this information primarily to provide a 
			customized experience as you use our Products and Services, and 
			generally, do not share this information with third parties. 
			However, we may disclose personal information collected if we have 
			received your permission beforehand or in very special 
			circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is 
			required by law or other special cases described below. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Registration: </b>Members may be asked to provide certain personal 
			information when they sign up for our Products or Services including 
			name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a 
			credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to 
			access the Services. The personal information collected from Members 
			during the registration process is used to manage each Member's 
			account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not 
			shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or 
			in special circumstances.<br>
			<br>
			However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly 
			promote our Services, we may provide the partner certain personal 
			information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who 
			subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for 
			the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the 
			results of the promotion.<br>
			<br>
			In this instance, personal information may not be used by the 
			partner for any other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying 
			and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide 
			during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of 
			Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this 
			aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements 
			that appear on the Services.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Our Company Partners and Sponsors: </b>Some products and services may be 
			offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, 
			independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide 
			Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the 
			partner may need to collect and maintain personal information. In 
			these instances, you will be notified before any such data is 
			collected or transferred and may decide not to use that particular 
			service or feature.<br>
			<br>
			Additionally, our partners may have advertisements or co-branded Web 
			Pages that are cosponsored by an affiliate, independent contractor 
			seller, or non-affiliated partner. Our company may share 
			non-identifying and aggregate information (except as described 
			above), but not personal information, with such partners in order to 
			administer the co-branded products or services offered. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Online Shopping:</b> At some Web sites, you can purchase products and 
			services or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter, 
			catalogue or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may 
			be asked to provide contact information, such as your name, address, 
			email address, phone number, and credit/debit card information.<br>
			<br>
			If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift 
			order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide 
			information about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, 
			address, and phone number. Our company has no control over the third 
			parties' use of any personal information you provide when placing 
			such an order. Please exercise care when doing so.<br>
			<br>
			If you order services or products directly from our company we 'Will 
			use the personal information you provide only to process that order. 
			We do not share this information with outside parties except to the 
			extent necessary to complete that order.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Online Advertisements:</b> Our company may display our online 
			advertisements. In those cases we share aggregated and 
			non-identifying information about our Visitors and Members collected 
			through the registration process as well as through online surveys 
			and promotions with these advertisers.<br>
			<br>
			Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and 
			non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements or 
			joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company 
			tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an 
			advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated 
			and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then 
			display or send the advertisement to the intended audience. Our 
			company does not share personal information about its Visitors or 
			Members with these advertisers or joint venture companies. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Responses to Email Inquiries:</b> When Visitors or Members send email 
			inquiries to our company, the return email address is used to answer 
			the email inquiry we receive. Our company does not use the return 
			email address for any other purpose and does not share the return 
			email address with any third party.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Voluntary Customer Surveys: </b>We may periodically conduct both 
			business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers 
			to participate in these surveys because they provide us with 
			important information that helps us to improve the types of products 
			and services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal 
			information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if 
			the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our 
			customer surveys is voluntary.<br>
			<br>
			We may take the information we receive from individuals responding 
			to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the 
			responses of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic 
			responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, 
			hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other 
			demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to 
			improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new 
			services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying 
			information may be shared with third parties.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Special Cases: </b>It is our company's policy not to use or share the 
			personal information about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to 
			the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity 
			to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. <br>
			<br>
			However, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or 
			Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web 
			sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our 
			sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, 
			including: credit agencies, collection agencies, merchant database 
			agencies, law enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as the 
			Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, 
			regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information~ 
			to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or 
			bring legal action against someone who may be violating our 
			Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service, or other user policies~ 
			to operate the Services properly~ or to protect our company and our 
			Members.<br>
			<br>

			privacy is especially important to us. It is our policy to comply 
			with the US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all 
			other applicable laws. Therefore we restrict our Web site to persons 
			eighteen years or older. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Public Forums: </b>Please remember that any information you may disclose 
			in any Member Directory, or other public areas of our Web sites or 
			the Internet, becomes public information. You should exercise 
			caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these 
			public areas.<br>

			<b>Our Company's Commitment to Data Security: </b>Services and Web sites we 
			sponsor have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, 
			and alteration of the information under our control. While we make 
			every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and 
			systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent 
			third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.<br>
