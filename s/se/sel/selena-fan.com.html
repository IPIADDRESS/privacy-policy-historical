<center><strong>BUDDYTV <br>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></center>
<br><br>

<p>BuddyTV ("BuddyTV")   is committed to protecting its users' privacy. This Privacy Policy (the   "Privacy Policy"), as set forth   below, covers <a href="http://buddytv.com" target="_blank">buddytv.com</a> (“<a href="http://buddytv.com" target="_blank">buddytv.com</a>,” the   “Site,” or the "website") and applies solely to information   collected on <a href="http://buddytv.com" target="_blank">buddytv.com</a> . Please read this Privacy Policy to understand   how we will treat personally and non-personally   identifiable information we collect on <a href="http://buddytv.com" target="_blank">buddytv.com</a>. This Privacy Policy   may change from time to time, so   please check back periodically. &nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p><strong>What personally identifiable     information is collected from me?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>We recognize the importance   of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information   collected about visitors to the Site.   Except with respect to certain designated elements of the Site that   require registration, you can use <a href="http://buddytv.com" target="_blank">buddytv.com</a> without divulging any personally identifiable information, including your email address. The Site   does not collect personally identifiable information about you unless   you expressly provide such   information   to us on a voluntary basis. For example, you may provide your personally identifiable information to   complete contest entry forms, to complete your registration on the Site   or the various services offered on   the Site, including community postings such as the <a href="http://buddytv.com" target="_blank">buddytv.com</a> Community,   chats and bulletin boards. Except   as described below, in those instances in which you "opt-in"   to receive offers directly from our third party   partners, such personally identifiable information will never be shared   with third parties outside of   BuddyTV   and its affiliated companies or third party vendors acting on their behalf. &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
We may, from time to time,   give you the opportunity to receive special offers, such as newsletters,     email reminders or special discounts,     directly from companies with which we partner. In order to take   advantage of these opportunities, you   must affirmatively authorize us to share your personally identifiable information with these third   party partners; we will never share such information unless you   specifically "opt-in" to receive   such an offer from one of our partners. Similarly, as part of certain   sweepstakes entries we may also give you   the opportunity to sign up to receive special offers from our   advertising partners. Again, during the   entry process, your information will be shared with our partners only   if you take specific action to   indicate   that you would like us to do so. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
You may choose to provide us   with the certain personally identifiable information when using the   Site or the various services offered   on the Site, including:&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Your name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Your home   contact information (physical address and/or phone number)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Online   contact information (email address)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Your login   information &nbsp;<br>
<br>
In addition, at times, we may   ask you to provide non-personally identifiable information about   yourself   that may be linked with your   personally   identifiable information you provide. Provision of this information   is optional. Such information   includes:&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Gender<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Preferences   (what you like or dislike)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Survey   answers (votes and ratings of TV shows) &nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p><strong>What non-personally   identifiable   information is collected automatically?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>We automatically collect   certain   non-personally identifiable information from you to optimize our web   pages for your computer such as&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * clickstream   information (internet protocol ("IP") address, internet service   provider, platform type, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;date/time   stamp) http protocol information (last URL requested and browser type)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * interaction   information (browser interaction such as when the mouse moves over an   image)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * computer   information (computer and browser information)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * search   terms (search text) &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  We may use such non-personally   identifiable information for internal purposes, including, but not   limited   to, improving the content of the   Site and the services offered on the Site. (See "How is my information   used?")&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p><strong>How is my information used?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>We will use personally   identifiable   information that you submit to the Site for the purposes for which you submitted it. At the time you   provide personally identifiable information, you have the option of   instructing us not to send you our special   email offers, and of affirmatively consenting to receiving email offers   about, or from, our partners. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We may disclose personally   identifiable information when required by law or when we have a good   faith belief that such action is necessary   to comply with a current judicial proceeding, court order, government investigation or legal   process.&nbsp;   We may, in our sole discretion, comply with subpoenas seeking personal   information without notifying you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We may use non-personally   identifiable   information collected on the Site to enhance the Site and our product offerings, to maintain and   secure the Site, and to understand the interests of Site visitors.   Generally,   we use non-personally identifiable     information to analyze trends, administer the website, and gather   information for aggregate use (IP addresses     are not linked to personally identifiable information).&nbsp; </p>
<p>We may also use the statistical     compilation and aggregation of non-personally identifiable information   and may provide such information   to third parties for marketing, advertising or research purposes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We may also disclose your   personally   identifiable information to any third party as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary   or appropriate, in connection with a merger or consolidation with such   third party or the sale of some or   all of our assets, provided that such third party agrees to comply with   the then-current version of this   Privacy Policy.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p><strong>How is my information kept   secure?</strong> &nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>We maintain commercially   reasonable   safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personally identifiable information   submitted   to our Sites, and we periodically review and update security measures   in light of current technologies.&nbsp;     However, you should be aware that security measures sometimes fail,   and we make no guarantees regarding the security of your personally   identifiable information.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Profile Preferences</strong>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>You may change your personal   profile preferences on the site at any time.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Email Policies</strong>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>By default, we send a weekly   and sometimes bi-weekly newsletter updates regarding TV news stories,   new features, and updates from   BuddyTV.&nbsp; We also send a variety of notification emails pertaining   to your profile and your friends   interactions   with the site.&nbsp; You have full control over which emails you wish   to receive, simply go to “My   Profile” and edit your preferences.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Inviting Friends</strong>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>BuddyTV is more fun with   friends!&nbsp;   The site is a community site made up of friendly TV lovers and is intended to be shared with   friends; however, it is completely optional to invite friends.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  When inviting friends, we will   send an email to the addresses you enter indicating it is a message   from you so that they know it is   coming from you.&nbsp; If a friend does not respond, we may send one   or two reminder messages on your behalf.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
As an added convenience,   BuddyTV   offers the ability import address books from Hotmail, Yahoo, Gmail,   and AOL.&nbsp; We access the address   book only once for the sole purpose of retrieving your friends’   information   so that you can select who you   would like to invite.&nbsp; We do not store any login details or use   them for any other purpose than to retrieve   your contacts.&nbsp; We never invite contacts that you do not explicitly   select and no emails will be sent   to your friends other than the invite email unless they register to   join BuddyTV.&nbsp; By selecting such   contacts, you consent to our access of your email in-box and contact   list for this purpose, and waive any federal, state, or local law which   restricts access to your in-box or email communications.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p><strong>What are cookies and how   are they used by the Sites?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>Cookies are files that a web   site places on an individual's hard-drive for record-keeping purposes.   Cookies, which are an industry standard   used by most web sites, can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and   use of a site.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Our cookies cannot be used   to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are   uniquely assigned to you, and can only   be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.   We will not share or sell   non-aggregated   information contained within cookies with any third party. The cookie itself does not contain any   personally identifiable information.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
If you do not want information   collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in   most browsers that allows you to   deny or accept the cookie feature, but you should note that cookies   may be necessary to provide you with   such special features as customized content delivery. Cookies can be   removed from your computer by following     Internet browser "help" file directions.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p><strong>What do I need to know about     third party sites, co-branded sites, and BuddyTV's online business   partners?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>We have established   relationships   that allow visitors to the Site to go directly to sites operated by   third parties. Some of these sites   may be co-branded with our logos; however, they are not operated or   maintained by BuddyTV. We are not   responsible   for the content or practices of web sites operated by third parties   that are linked to the Site. These   links are meant for the user's convenience only. Links to third party   sites do not constitute our sponsorship,     endorsement or approval of the content, policies or practices of such   third party sites. Once you have   left the Site via such a link, you should check the applicable privacy   policy of the third party site.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  We may use third parties to   manage sweepstakes, games, contests, chats or other features, and these   parties may have access to personally   identifiable information submitted by visitors who participate in those activities.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p><strong>BigDoor Virtual Economy   Platform</strong>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>We have incorporated in the   Website loyalty programs and other offers provided through BigDoor   Media.&nbsp;   Your use of the BigDoor Virtual Economy Platform (“VEP”) is governed   by the terms of use posted at <a href="http://www.bigdoor.com/veptermsofuse" target="_blank">www.bigdoor.com/veptermsofuse</a> and privacy policy posted at <a href="http://www.bigdoor.com/privacy/" target="_blank"><u>http://www.bigdoor.com/privacy/</u></a> (collectively   “VEP Terms”) which may include provisions regarding use and disclosure   of your personal information. The VEP   program allows you to participate in a virtual economy consisting of   virtual currency/points, awards, levels   and virtual goods (“VEP Components”). By interacting with VEP Components     on the Site or otherwise using the VEP program   you agree to be bound by the VEP Terms, including   VEP’s privacy policy, which may differ from our   policy and terms. The VEP Terms contain a dispute resolution provision   that you must read carefully and agree to before using the service.   The VEP service is not available where prohibited by law and is not   available for use if you are under the age of 13.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Does BuddyTV use Third Party     Ad Servers?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>We use third party advertising   companies and advertising networks to deliver advertisements on the   Site. These companies may use   cookies,   web beacons, clear .gifs or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help   measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness. The use of these technologies by these companies     is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this   Privacy Policy. If you would like more   information about this practice please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Does BuddyTV collect   personally   identifiable information from children?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>We ask that all parents spend   time with their children and monitor what sites their children are   visiting. We do not knowingly collect   personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.   We also suggest that no children under   18 submit personally identifiable information to any game, membership, contest or promotion that we   might host without first obtaining a parent's consent. Our Site is not   intended for use by and is not directed   to children.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Privacy   Policy</strong>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>We will occasionally update   this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the "last   updated" date at the bottom of the Privacy   Policy.   For material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by   placing a prominent notice on the Site.&nbsp;<br>
