<div class="termsAndPrivacy privacy">
    <div class="sectionContent"><h2 class="mainTitle">Privacy:</h2>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p> This Privacy Policy governs our policies and practices with respect
            to the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") and other data that is collected
            by Tremus, Inc. ("Tremus", "we", "us" and/or "our") in connection with our website, located at <a href="http://SelfScore.com">http://SelfScore.com</a> or SelfScore (the "Site") and our
            mobile applications and related services (together with the Site, the "Service(s)"). By using our
            Services you are consenting to our processing of your Personal Information and data as set forth in
            this Privacy Policy now and as amended. As used herein, "processing" means using or accessing
            information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, combining and
            disclosing information. Our servers are located in the United States. Accordingly, if you reside
            outside the U.S., by using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that your Personal Information
            will be transferred to the United States, and processed and stored in the United States. By using
            our Services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those
            third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy. </p></section>
        <h3 class="title">Information Collection and Use.</h3>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b>Opting Out of SelfScore.com.</b> If you are not a user of the
            Services and wish to opt out, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@selfscore.com" target="_blank">privacy@selfscore.com</a> and we
            will reply with opt-out instructions, including steps to authenticate your request. Current users of
            our Services should follow the same steps. </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b>Information Collected Upon Registration.</b> If you desire to
            have access to certain restricted sections of the Services and/or to have access to or use of
            certain parts of the Services, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit
            certain Personal Information to SelfScore.com. Personal Information that we may collect in such
            instances may include your full user name, email address, city, time zone, telephone number, date of
            birth, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in
            your public profile. We may also ask our users to generate a new personal identification number
            (PIN) to access our Services (the new PIN and the mobile application will enhance security). </p>
        </section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p> Providing additional information beyond what is required at
            registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find
            opportunities in the SelfScore system. </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b>Geo-location Data.</b> SelfScore.com receives location
            information from the Social Media Services (as defined below) that you enable within the Service and
            also (with your permission) from your mobile device ("Geo-location Data"). We use Geo-location Data
            to complete and maintain your SelfScore.com profile (for example, to indicate that you are located
            in New York City or work at a specific company) and for security purposes, customize the Service to
            make it more relevant to you (for example, to provide context behind your profile versus that of
            your area) and to offer you location-relevant Trust Rewards (as defined below). </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b>Log Data.</b> When you interact with the Site or use our
            Services, our servers automatically receive and store certain personally non-identifiable
            information ("Log Data"). This Log Data is collected passively and may include information such as
            your IP address, browser type, mobile phone type, or the domain from which you are visiting, the
            Site pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most
            users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider, the IP address will be different
            every time you log on. We use Log Data to provide you with the Services (for example, to provide
            push notifications on your mobile device) and pool it with other information to monitor the use of
            the Services, and for the technical administration of the Services. We do not associate your IP
            address with any other Personal Information to identify you personally, except in cases where we are
            asked to comply with a subpoena or other legal demand or where we suspect that there has been a
            violation of our policies, our Terms of Service and/or applicable law. </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b>Cookies.</b> Like many websites and services, we also may use
            "cookie" technology to collect additional Site usage data and to improve the Site and Services. A
            cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk. We do not use cookies to
            collect Personal Information. Also, our cookies may only collect information with respect to your
            visits to and actions on our Site. Tremus may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to
            better understand how you interact with the Services and our Service, to monitor aggregate usage by
            our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our Services. A session
            cookie enables certain features of the Site and Services and is deleted from your computer when you
            disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may
            be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by
            following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept
            cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to
            prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p> We may deliver a file (known as a "web beacon") from an ad network
            to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated
            auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to
            serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must
            request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can
            view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b>Financial Information.</b> We do not currently collect financial
            information, such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other
            financial information);that information is collected and stored by our third party payment
            processing company (the "Payment Processor"), and use and storage of that information is governed by
            the Payment Processor's applicable terms of service and privacy policy. </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b>Use of Information.</b> SelfScore.com and Tremus, Inc. use the
            Personal Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. We will
            use your Personal Information in order to provide you with access to and use of our Services, to
            help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better identify, authenticate and
            understand the our users, to maintain our high-trust community, and to benefit users and partners
            through highly personalized offerings. If you contact us by email through the Services, we may keep
            a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any
            information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you. In addition, we may use your
            contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about our products and
            services and the products and services of our partners that we believe may be of interest to you. If
            you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such marketing information or
            communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the
            communications. </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p> In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of
            our Services, SelfScore also often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and
            behavior based on the Personal Information and other information provided to us. This research may
            be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and SelfScore.com or Tremus Inc. may share this
            aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does
            not identify you personally. SelfScore.com or Tremus Inc. may also disclose aggregated user
            statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners, and to
            other third parties for other lawful purposes. </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure.</b> We consider your
            information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain
            circumstances in which we may share your Personal Information with certain third parties without
            further notice to you, as set forth below. </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b>Service Providers.</b> We engage certain trusted third parties to
            perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and
            maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns.
            We will share your Personal Information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary
            to perform these functions and provide such services. </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b>Partners.</b> SelfScore or its partners may offer rewards or
            "SelfScore Rewards" for third party products and services, which may be redeemed by you based on
            your SelfScore. To redeem certain Trust Rewards, our partners may request that you provide Personal
            Information to them directly;please be aware that the privacy policy of such partners will govern
            their use of your Personal Information. In addition, Tremus' or SelfScore.com's partners may access
            our application programming interfaces ("APIs") in order to determine your SelfScore by using
            information (such as Twitter handles) already in their possession. They may use this information to
            determine, for example, whether you qualify for certain benefits other than Trust Rewards. In order
            to determine whether you qualify for certain special rewards, Trust Rewards may also provide our
            partners with your SelfScore, username and other Personal Information relating to the special
            rewards. Please note: we only provide information to these partners that is otherwise publicly
            available. </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b>Financial Information.</b> As stated above, we do not currently
            collect financial information, as that information is collected and stored by our Payment Processor.
            However, we may from time to time request and receive some of your financial information from our
            Payment Processor for the purposes of completing transactions you have initiated through the
            Services, enrolling you in discount, rebate, and other programs in which you elect to participate,
            protecting against or identify possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage
            our business. </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b>Social Media Services.</b> You can choose to access certain third
            party social media Web sites and services through our Services (such as LinkedIn or Facebook)
            ("Social Media Services"). When you do so, you are sharing information with those Social Media
            Services, and the information you share will be governed by their privacy policies and terms of
            service. You may also be able to modify your privacy settings with these Social Media Services to,
            for example, control what information the Social Media Services disclose to third parties like
            Tremus Inc. When you add Social Media Service accounts to the Service or log into the Service using
            your Social Media Services account, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable our
            Service to access that Social Media Service, but you will provide your login information, like your
            password, directly to such Social Media Service (and not to Tremus). As part of such integration,
            the Social Media Service will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided
            to such Social Media Service, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance
            with this Privacy Policy and, if and to the extent applicable, the policies of such Social Media
            Services. However, please remember that the manner in which Social Media Services use, store and
            disclose your information is governed by the policies of such third parties, and Tremus shall have
            no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Social Media
            Services that may be enabled within the Service. </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b>Business Transfers.</b> Tremus may sell, transfer or otherwise
            share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger,
            acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b>Disclosures for Legal Purposes.</b> Tremus may disclose your
            Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is
            necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of
            Tremus, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or
            the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability. </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b> Security.</b> Tremus is very concerned about the security of
            your Personal Information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to
            protect your information from unauthorized access. However, no Internet or email transmission is
            ever fully secure or error free. We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the
            security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored Personal
            Information to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible
            and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii)
            any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach, to restore the reasonable integrity of
            the data system, and to identify the individuals and techniques causing the breach. </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b>Links to Other Websites.</b> Our Services contain links to other
            websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation
            of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites.
            These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or
            solicit personally identifiable information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding
            the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable information you submit to them. We encourage
            you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit. </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b>Our Policy Towards Children.</b> If a parent or guardian becomes
            aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without his/her consent, he or
            she should contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@selfscore.com" target="_blank">privacy@selfscore.com</a>.
            We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If we become aware that a
            child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our
            files. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through the
            Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to
            help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information
            via the Services without their permission. </p></section>
        <section class="privacySec desc"><p><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy.</b> The Services and our business
            may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for Tremus to make changes
            to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may be updated or modified from time to time for any
            reason without prior notice. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by
            posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site or by emailing you. This Privacy Policy was last updated
            on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to
            this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy. You
            are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. </p></section>
