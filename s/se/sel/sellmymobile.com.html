        </ul>
        <p class="mb20">The provision of some of our services may also require us to store some personal information. We will periodically review your personal information to ensure that we do not keep it for longer than is necessary.</p>
        <p class="mb30">Please note that certain information does not constitute personal data under the Data Protection Act 1998, if it is not possible to identify a particular living individual from such information or other information which is in (or is likely to come into) our possession.</p>
        <h2 class="mb20">Information relating to third parties</h2>
        <p class="mb30">Where you provide information about a third party, you will ensure that such third party has given their consent. You should not provide any information relating to any other person, without first informing them of this policy and obtaining their prior consent to you submitting such information on their behalf.</p>
        <h2 class="mb20">Purposes for which we use your personal information</h2>
        <p class="mb20">We may use your personal information:</p>

They may process and store your personal information on our behalf in their systems subject to strict compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998. They will not contact you directly or share your personal information with any third parties.</p>

        <p class="mb20">We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>
