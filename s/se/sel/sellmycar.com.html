											utmost concern. We are committed to your privacy and security, and to providing 
											you the best possible user experience. We may update this policy from time to 
											time, so please check here frequently.
											<br>
											<br>
											What do we mean by privacy? We will never disclose your information to any 
											third party without your consent, except in limited circumstances to our 
											business partners with whom we have established agreements that protect your 
											privacy
											<br>
											<br>
											Here's how we collect and use information from you in our efforts to provide 
											the highest quality user experience:
											<br>
											<br>
											<b>IP Address </b>- Your IP or "Internet Protocol" address and other site usage 
											data is used to gather broad demographic information. This data helps us serve 
											you by allowing us to understand how visitors use our web sites.
											<br>
											<br>
											<b>Cookies</b> - Our sites use a technology called "cookies," small files 
											stored by your browser to help keep track of your user profile. Our cookies do 
											not collect personally identifiable information, nor do we share them with 
											anyone. We use cookies to remember your personal profile for your convenience, 
											to deliver content specific to your needs and interests, and to ensure you 
											don't see the same ad repeatedly. We also use cookies to track user trends and 
											improve areas of our sites that our users find valuable.
											<br>
											<br>
											<b>Ads</b> - We sometimes use outside companies to display advertising on our 
											web sites. These ads may place cookies on your computer, which are referenced 
											by our ad companies. We do not have access to this information. We use customer 
											contact information from registration forms to send you information related to 
											our products and services if you consent to receiving such mailings. Your 
											contact information may also be used to contact you when necessary for 
											administrative purposes related to your account. We use your email as a unique 
											identifier in our record system, to verify communications from you, and to send 
											you newsletters and promotion offerings that you ask to receive or to tell you 
											about changes to the SellMyCar.com website.
											<br>
											<br>
											Demographic information and site usage data is also collected on our sites. We 
											use this data to tailor your experience, allowing us to provide content related 
											to your preferences and information on products or services we think you may be 
											interested in.
											<br>
											<br>
											<b>Email Services</b> - If you take advantage of any email notification 
											features on our sites, you will receive email updates as described in the 
											service. The SellMyCar.com website provides users the opportunity to opt-out of 
											receiving communications from our partners and us. Users can remove their 
											personal information from the database of a particular site by sending a 
											request by email to </font><a href="contactus.aspx"><font size="1">by clicking 
											here </font></a><font size="1">, by typing, "unsubscribe" in a response to 
										the email received. </font></font></p>
								<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><font size="1"><br>
											<b>Order Forms</b> - Our sites use forms for you to request information, 
											products and services. We collect financial information to bill you for the 
											products and services you indicate. (See "Your Security" below for more on how 
											we safeguard your financial information and social security information.) We 
											collect social security information to provide credit check, loan application 
											and similar services. We collect contact information, unique identifiers and 
											demographic information for the purposes described in "Registration" above. See 
											"Disclosure" for more information on when we provide your information to third 
											party business partners.
											<br>
											<br>
											<br>
											<br>
											<strong>Security</strong>
											<br>
											The personal data we do store on our system is protected by firewall and 
											password. Our network firewall is a combination of hardware and software 
											designed to keep unauthorized users from accessing our network. The password 
											you select, along with your unique email address, prevents others from 
											accessing your information. We suggest that you do not disclose your password 
											to anyone.
											<br>
											<br>
											<b>Third parties that have their own privacy policies that may be different than 
												ours provide Third Party Service Providers - some of the services available 
												through our website</b>. You should review the privacy policy of third 
											parties before providing your personal information to them.
											<br>
											<br>
											<b>Outside Links</b> - While on SellMyCar.com, you may be led to other web 
											sites. Be aware that other sites may collect data and personal information and 
											operate according to their own privacy practices. Please remember that, once 
											outside of our website, any information you submit is outside of our control.
											<br>
											<b>Disclosure</b> - To provide you the best products and services, we team with 
											business partners. When you indicate that you want to receive a product or 
											service, or contact a person or organization, we share the data needed for you 
											to receive what you have indicated. Occasionally, we hire consultants that may 
											need access to our member database to perform their services for us. We take 
											great care to require that these business partners agree by contract not to use 
											any member information that they may receive access to.
											<br>
											<br>
											SellMyCar.com may contract with outside companies to administer our mailing 
											lists or provide retail services. Your personal information may be shared with 
											an outside company for the sole purpose of administering the products, services 
											and programs you have selected.

											to opt out of receiving communications from our partners and us. To remove your 
											personal information from one of our web sites, email a request to the site at

											service, simply reply to the email and type "Unsubscribe" in the subject line.
