<br><b>About SelectSmart.com Selectors</b>
<br>SelectSmart.com selectors are designed to help you narrow down the choices on a variety of topics.  We hope that you will view them to be a good starting point.  If any decisions are important to you we encourage you to that pursue more information.  Read books, magazines, and other websites.  Consult experts.  Throughout this site we link to sites that will help you with you to learn more and discover your best choices.
<p>
<br><b>The SelectSmart.com Selector Methodology</b>
<br>Our selectors use a numeric point system.  If an item has a trait or characteristic you desire, then that item "earns" a certain number of points.  In some cases if it is trait you do not want, points are subtracted.
</p><p>
<br><b>The American Presidential Candidate Selector</b> (and few other selectors) use a slightly different methodology.  That is each candidate gets the same number of points per issue.  The points may be distributed all to one side of the "fence" or the other.  Or the points may be distributed on both sides of the fence--this is especially true of centrist candidates who adopt positions that frequently straddle the middle ground.  If a candidate clarifies or changes positions, we adjust the scores accordingly.  We continuously glean campaign websites and news articles to understand the candidates' current positions.   We use that information to determine the distribution of points.  In a number of occasions we are in direct contact with the candidates themselves or their staffs.  If you are curious about individial candidates and their rankings, ask one question at time to see their scores. 
</p><p>
<br>We are dedicated to continuous improvement.  Please notify us if you have corrections or suggestions.
