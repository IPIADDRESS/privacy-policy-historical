          <b>ABOUT OUR PRIVACY POLICY</b>
          <ul>
            <li>This privacy policy applies when you visit or use our websites and other services, including events, that
              refer or link to this privacy policy (each, a “<b>Service</b>”). It also describes your choices regarding use, access
              and correction of your personal information. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, do
              not access or use the Services. This privacy policy may be supplemented by additional privacy statements, terms
              or notices provided to you.</li>
            <li>This privacy policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrates with the Services,
              or any other third party products, services or businesses (“<b>Third Party Services</b>”). In addition, a separate
              agreement may govern delivery, access and use of the Services (the “<b>User Agreement</b>”), including the processing
              of any content submitted through your use of the Services (collectively, “<b>User Data</b>”). User Data may include,
              among other things, your name, user name, address, email address, telephone number, academic or other professional
              affiliation, digital object identifier, and other contact and demographic information when you register and
              set up an account, fill out a form, submit a comment or contact us by e-mail or other means. The organization
              (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the User Agreement (“<b>User</b>”) controls the
              content submitted through the Services and any associated User Data. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>INFORMATION WE COLLECT:</b> We collect information about you in three ways: directly from your input, from third-party
          sources, and through automated technologies.
          <ul>
            <li><span class="underline">Your Input - information you provide to us</span>: The types of personal information that we collect directly from
              you depends on the content and features of the Service you use and how you otherwise interact with us and may
              include:

                <li>Account login credentials, such as usernames and passwords, password hints and similar security information;</li>
                <li>Other account registration and profile information, including educational, professional and other background

                <li>Information that you communicate to us, such as questions or information you send to <a href="mailto:ai2-info@allenai.org">ai2-info@allenai.org</a>;</li>
                <li>Data that you provide to us as part of interacting with the Service, such as your saved papers, email
                  alerts, favorites and search queries; and/or</li>
                <li>Communications preferences, such as your preferred language and the frequency, type and format of the
                  alerts you sign up to receive.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="underline">Third Party Sources</span>: Data from other sources: We also may obtain contact details and other information about
              you from our parent corporation, affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “PGA Group”) as well as from third
              parties, including: (1) third party companies or individuals that help us process information and support the
              Services (“Third Party Providers”); and (2) publicly-available sources and data suppliers from which we obtain
              data to validate or supplement the information we hold.
              <ul>
                <li>This data may be combined with other information we collect and might include aggregate level data, such
                  as which IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries. </li>
                <li>We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Therefore,
                  we cannot and do not guarantee that your information will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. You understand
                  that when you use public areas of the Services, your information will be available to other users and in
                  some cases may be publicly available. We recommend you be cautious about giving out personal information
                  to others or sharing personal information in public areas, whether designated as public or private. We
                  are not responsible for the personal information you choose to share in these public areas or for the actions
                  of any third parties with whom you share personal information.</li>
                <li>You may choose to permit or restrict Third Party Providers from interacting with the Services. Typically,
                  Third Party Services are software that integrates with our Services, and User can permit its Authorized
                  Users to enable and disable these integrations. Once enabled, the provider of a Third Party Service may
                  share certain information with AI2. Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these
                  Third Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to AI2. When a Third Party Service is enabled,
                  AI2 is authorized to connect and access other information made available to AI2 in accordance with our
                  agreement with the Third Party Provider. We do not, however, receive or store passwords for any of these
                  Third Party Services when connecting them to the Services. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="underline">Automated Technologies - Device and usage data</span>: The Service may also automatically collect information about
              how you and your device interact with the Service, such as:
              <ul>
                <li>Computer, device and connection information, such as IP address, browser type and version, operating system
                  and other software installed on your device, unique device identifier and other technical identifiers,
                  error reports and performance data and your activity on the websites;</li>
                <li>Usage data, such as the features you used, the settings you selected, URL click stream data, including
                  date and time stamp and referring and exit pages, and pages you visited on the Service;</li>
                <li>For educational Services, the course modules and test questions you view, answer or complete; </li>
                <li>For location-aware Services, the physical location of your device.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>COOKIES.</b> We collect data through our servers and the use of cookies and other technologies. You can control
          cookies through your browser's settings and other tools. However, if you choose to block certain cookies, you may

          products, features and services, including to create logs and record when you access the Services from different
          devices, such as your work computer or your mobile device. We use Google Analytics and Google Customer Search Engine
          tools. For more information, please see <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html</a>. We also use a custom

          <p>If information is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable
              natural person, AI2 may use it for any business purpose. Users determine their own policies and practices for the
              sharing and disclosure of information, and AI2 does not control how they or any other third parties choose to share
              or disclose information.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>DATA RETENTION.</b> We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide the Service and fulfill the

          maintaining the Service, resolving disputes, maintaining security, detecting and preventing fraud and abuse, enforcing
          our agreements and other legitimate interests.</li>
        <li>
          <b>DATA SECURITY.</b> We work hard to protect information you provide from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access
          or disclosure. We take into account the sensitivity of the information we collect, process and store, and the current
          state of technology. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during
          transmission and once it is received. If you have any questions about the security of your information, you can
          contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@allenai.org">legal@allenai.org</a> Given the nature of communications and information processing technology, AI2 cannot
          guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise
          in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others. The safety and security of your information also
          depends on you. Where AI2 has given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the
          websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with
          anyone, and we urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the websites like message
          boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the websites. </li>
        <li>
          <b>LOCATIONS OF PROCESSING.</b> Your information will be stored and processed by AI2 in the United States. We take
          steps, including through contracts, to ensure that the information continues to be protected wherever it is located
          in a manner consistent with the standards of protection required under applicable law. Where personal information
          is transferred from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, we rely on appropriate safeguards such as
          the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses and Privacy Shield Frameworks to transfer the data
          and/or as otherwise authorized by applicable law.</li>
        <li>
          <b>GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING.</b> When we collect from you any personal information within the scope of European data
          protection laws, we do so:
          <ul>
            <li>where necessary to provide the Service, fulfill a transaction or otherwise perform a contract with you or
              at your request prior to entering into a contract;</li>
            <li>where necessary for our compliance with applicable law or other legal obligation;</li>
            <li>where necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest;</li>
            <li>where applicable, with your consent;</li>
            <li>as necessary to operate our business, protect the security of our systems and Users, detect or prevent fraud,
              or fulfill our other legitimate interests as described in the sections above, except where our interests are
              overridden by your privacy rights; and/or</li>
            <li>where necessary to complete scientific research where omitting such personal information would render impossible
              or seriously impair the achievement of the specific scientific research purpose.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Where we rely on your consent to process personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any
              time, and where we rely on legitimate interests, you may have the right to object to our processing.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>We collect author names as publicly accessible metadata from the web, publishers and other sources for
                  display across our website including in association with papers, presentations, blog posts, code repositories,
                  videos and citations/references. This data and content is stored indefinitely, but can be removed for display
                  from our public-facing website by blacklisting the associated content (note: we currently only have blacklisting
                  tools for presentations and papers). Blacklisting does not result in complete deletion of the associated
                  content.</li>
                <li>We use the author name from this publicly accessible metadata to auto-generate author profile pages where
                  we display content associated with an author, compute citation statistics and display links to other authors.</li>
                <li>Author profile pages can be updated by using the “Suggest Changes” button on an author’s profile page
                  to add/remove papers, add an affiliation, add a link to a homepage and add an ORCID ID to an author’s profile.
                  Requesters who submit changes are required to provide their first and last name, e-mail address and justification
                  which we store in a database to validate the request.</li>
                <li>We provide multiple options to sign in via Google, Facebook and Twitter. As part of the sign-in process
                  we collect and store the following data:

              <ul>
                <li>Citeomatic requires a PDF or abstract of a paper to provide citation recommendations. For debugging purposes,
                  we may log metadata about the uploaded paper (title, abstract, authors and references). We do not log or
                  store the full text of any uploaded paper. PDFs that are uploaded or fetched from an external URL are not
                  stored persistently. PDFs are discarded after metadata has been extracted from them. To facilitate sharing
                  results, we save a cache of predictions, which includes the title, author(s), abstract and bibliography
                  information extracted from a paper. We may inspect this cache at the request of a user or to facilitate
                  debugging.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Beaker and Common Sense allow a user to create accounts. Account information is stored on both AI2 servers
                  as well as Third Party Providers to facilitate future account access. </li>
                <li>Accounts include email address, name and organization. </li>
                <li>With an account, users can create datasets and run experiments in the cloud</li>
                <li>Datasets and experiments may be private or shared more broadly with other users or the public.</li>
