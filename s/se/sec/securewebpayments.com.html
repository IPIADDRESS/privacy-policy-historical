<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information on the Site. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with such sites and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on such sites.

If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all functionality of the Site.</p>

Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to us. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your login information, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.

<p><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong><br>

<p>Service Providers.

These third parties have access to End-User Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
<p>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose End-User Information to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to, subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Securewebpayments or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity. </p>

<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
Secure Web Payments is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We process payments in connection with the Service in compliance with the PCI Security Standards and employ reasonable physical, technological, and administrative security measures and attempt to ensure they are applicable under the circumstances.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting via the Service in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. </p>
<p><strong>International Transfer</strong><br>
Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Secure Web Payments may transfer your information, including Personal Information, to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer. </p>

Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.
