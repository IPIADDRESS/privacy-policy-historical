<p>It is the policy of SecurePay Pty Ltd to comply with the National Privacy  Principles set out in the <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> (Cwth) as required by that  Act ("federal privacy law"). Apart from our legal and ethical  commitment to compliance with the law, we value and respect our professional  relationships with our clients, staff and other individuals with whom we deal  and we respect their desire for privacy. </p>
<p>  SecurePay Pty Ltd collects for inclusion in a record and holds the following  types of personal information, purely for the purpose of best serving the needs  of its clients, staff and other persons to whom it has a commitment (which  includes serving its business needs as a technology and payment provider):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Information  of many types about individual clients generally as given to us by those  clients, collected in the course of acting for them;</li>
  <li>Information  of many types about individuals with whom our clients deal, collected from our  clients or from those individuals in the course of acting for our clients;</li>
  <li>Information  about roles, means of communication with and personal attributes of officers,  employees and other representatives of corporations with whom SecurePay Pty Ltd  or its clients deal, collected incidentally in the course of dealing with those  parties;</li>
  <li>Information  disclosed by personal users of SecurePay Pty Ltd’s information technology  systems (which are typical systems which store data), collected in the ordinary  course of those users¹ use of such systems;</li>
</ol>
<p>Information is destroyed when it is  no longer useful or it is unreliable and cannot be corrected. </p>
<p>SecurePay Pty Ltd only uses the  above types of information for the relevant client¹s needs or its internal  professional or business needs which include meeting its statutory and  contractual obligations, assessing persons¹ compliance with law, card scheme  rules and BECS clearance rules, firm policy and contracts, making payments and  of course communicating with the individual concerned. We only disclose the  above types of information in accordance with clients¹ requirements, as  required by law or in some cases to contractors or advisers (such as external  photocopying or IT contractors) in the course of the performance of their  duties but subject to equivalent privacy commitments. It is conceivable in an  extreme situation, but not anticipated, that such information could be  disclosed if it is both important for the individual and is permissible under  federal privacy law (eg a health or safety threat). <br>
  <br>
  Personal information is not used or  disclosed unless, relying on its internal practices, SecurePay Pty Ltd is  confident that it is accurate, complete and current. Individuals can assist us  to maintain accurate records by notifying us of any change in their personal  details. <br>
  SecurePay Pty Ltd will allow an  individual access to personal information about himself or herself except to  the extent that it is entitled to deny access under federal privacy law. It  will correct any such information which the individual establishes is not  accurate, complete or up-to-date. <br>
  If SecurePay Pty Ltd receives,  although it has not sought, personal information about individuals from them or  from other persons, it only retains it in a record if it is necessary for  SecurePay Pty Ltd’s functions or activities and if it can comply with federal  privacy law in relation to it. <br>
  This privacy policy is also the  policy of each officer and employee of SecurePay Pty Ltd for all purposes not  connected with his or her personal, family or household affairs. </p>
