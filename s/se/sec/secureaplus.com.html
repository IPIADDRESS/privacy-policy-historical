				<p class="privacy justify">Your privacy is important to SECUREAGE. We understand the premium you place on the protection of your privacy on the Internet, and we want you to feel as comfortable as possible visiting our Website and using its services. This Privacy Policy will tell you what information we collect, how we protect it and what choices you have about how that information is used.</p>
				<h3>What personally identifiable information does SECUREAGE collect from me?</h3>
				<p class="privacy justify">SECUREAGE may at times collect personally identifiable information from you in the course of providing our services or support. This information may be collected from your computer, via the registration process, submission of survey forms or any other forms of electronic communication (including communications between your computer and us, or other automated communications).</p>
				<p class="privacy justify">This information is collected to help us provide the service or support that you have requested.</p>
				<p class="privacy justify"><span class="bold">Personal Particulars</span> - During the registration or online survey process, you will be asked a number of questions pertaining to information such as name, email address, company and other system information. This information is collected for identification purposes, and to confirm that transactions with you are legitimate and not an imposter. We will not use this information for direct marketing purposes unless you "opt in" to receive such communications, except that we may notify you of similar products or services that we offer to the extent that we are permitted to do so by law. We may also contact you if your product license has expired or is about to expire.</p>
				<p class="privacy justify"><span class="bold">Software Unique ID </span> - SECUREAPLUS SOFTWARE comes with a unique number which gives an identity to the software installation process. This information is specifically designed to support the user registration process, license upgrade and to provide a better technical support to user.</p>
				<p class="privacy justify"><span class="bold">Relevant System Information  </span> - In order to provide best-in-class antivirus support to you, we may collect certain information from your machines. This information may include, without limitation, your email address, IP address, information about your hardware and software, files stored on your computer (including potentially dangerous or infected files) and other relevant system information.

This is solely for the purpose of file scanning and identification of any possible malware detected on your computer. None of your document files will be uploaded from your computer to SECUREAPLUS UNIVERSAL AV SERVER since the document files scanning is performed by SecureAPlus antivirus component that is installed on the computer. </p>
				<p class="privacy justify"><span class="bold">Website Analytics Tools  </span> - We are currently using two website analytic tools: Google Analytics and Awstats to help us understand the use of our site by our visitors.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this PRIVACY POLICY or any DOCUMENTATION or other materials provided to you in connection with the SECUREAPLUS SOFTWARE, SECUREAGE reserves all rights to cooperate with any legal process or government inquiry (including, but not limited to, court orders and law enforcement requests) related to your use of the SECUREAPLUS SOFTWARE.

In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</p>
				<p class="privacy justify">Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.</p>
