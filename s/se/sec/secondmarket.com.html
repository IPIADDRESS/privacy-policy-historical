<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the NASDAQ Private Market&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasdaqprivatemarket.com/legal/user-agreement">User Agreement</a>&nbsp;and the ExactEquity&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasdaqprivatemarket.com/site/terms.php">Terms of Service agreement</a>&nbsp;(“<strong>Terms</strong>”). The term “<strong>NASDAQ Private Market,</strong>” “<strong>we,</strong>” and “<strong>us</strong>” includes The NASDAQ Private Market, LLC and our affiliates and subsidiaries.

<ul><li>collect,</li>
<li>use, and</li>
<li>disclose&nbsp;information we obtain through the “<strong>Site</strong>,” as defined in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasdaqprivatemarket.com/legal/user-agreement">User Agreement.</a></li>
</ul><p>An “<strong>RBD</strong>” means a sponsoring registered broker-dealer, and its affiliates.</p>
<p>“<strong>You</strong>” and “<strong>Users</strong>” means all users who have registered to use the Site. Users may include issuers, issuers’ administrators or representatives, RBDs, clients of RBDs, and investors.</p>
<h5>THE SITE COLLECTS INFORMATION</h5>

For basic registration, you may need to provide personal information, such as your name, email address, and password. To access and use certain additional information and functionality you may need to provide additional personal information. For example, if you are a potential investor, you may need to submit an investor questionnaire to ensure that you are eligible under securities laws to invest in the securities offered through the Site (the “<strong>Investor Questionnaire</strong>”). The Investor Questionnaire may request your address, date of birth, driver’s license number, social security number, employer information, citizenship, income, net worth, investment experience, and other bank or financial information.</p>
<p><strong>Using the Site.</strong>&nbsp;We collect the information that you post through the Site, including personal information. For example, when you complete transactions or communicate through the Site, the Site will collect the information provided as part of such submissions, including any personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Financial and Equity Holding Information.</strong>&nbsp;The Site may collect certain financial information from you, such as bank account information, to properly facilitate transactions and in connection with your Investor Questionnaire. If a company in which you hold equity is using ExactEquity for equity plan management, that company and you may provide us personal and financial information, records, instructions and documents relating to your equity holdings and related transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Collection with RBDs.</strong>&nbsp;When we collect information from and about a client of a RBD through the Site, we jointly collect such information for our purposes as well as for the RBD’s purposes. Please see the privacy policy for the RBD with which you have a business relationship to learn about such RBD’s privacy practices.</p>

If you are using the Site as a client of a RBD, we may provide the information, records, and documents collected from or about you through the Site to the RBD with which you have a business relationship so they can provide services to you. For example, if you are an investor, we may provide your profile information, including any submitted Investor Questionnaire, to the RBD with which you are doing business so the RBD can confirm whether such investor meets securities law qualifications for the offering of a particular security. We may provide Users with controls to determine how we provide information to third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of RBDs who receive information about you. Please see the privacy policy for the RBD with which you have a business relationship to learn about such RBD’s privacy practices.</p>

We cannot control how such entities may use or disclose such information.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Permission.</strong>&nbsp;We may also disclose your information with your permission.</p>
<h5>INFORMATION RETENTION</h5>
<p>We may be required to keep different types of information for varying periods of time according to contractual requirements, government regulations and regulatory obligations.

We may keep some information longer to meet our data retention policies, our needs and those of our customers, even after you close your account.</p>
<h5>INFORMATION SECURITY</h5>
<p>We take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information. The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card or bank account information) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both in transit and at rest. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and we do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.</p>
<h5>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h5>
<p>We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from children under 13 years of age, and no part of the Site is directed to children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected any personal information from children under 13, we will promptly take steps to delete or destroy such information and terminate the child’s account.</p>
