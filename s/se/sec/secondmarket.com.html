    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p class="text-muted small">Effective Date: June 20, 2014</p>
    
    <p class="justify">This Privacy Policy or "Policy" explains how SecondMarket Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries and
        affiliates (collectively, "SecondMarket", "we", "our", and "us") collect and protect Personal Information (as defined below).
        If you have any questions that this Policy does not address, please contact us at legal@secondmarket.com.
        By creating an account on any SecondMarket site (a "SecondMarket Site") or by otherwise submitting Personal Information
        to us through a SecondMarket Site, you give your consent to the collection and use of your Personal Information as explained
        in this Policy. This Policy is part of our Terms of Service and all capitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy
        have the meaning given to them in the Terms of Service.</p>
    
    <p class="justify">SecondMarket's Policy applies to current and former SecondMarket clients and any other users of any
        SecondMarket Site. The term "Personal Information" refers to non-public information that personally relates
        to or identifies you as an individual or entity.</p>
    
    <h2>Updates and Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
    
    <p class="justify">Please note that, in the event of a change in policy, a revised Policy will promptly be posted to
        the SecondMarket Site. You agree to accept posting of a revised Policy electronically on the SecondMarket Site as
        actual notice to you. Any dispute over our Policy is subject to this notice.</p>

    <h2>How and Why We Gather Information</h2>

    <p class="justify">When you sign up to participate on a SecondMarket Site, you may be asked to provide information
        such as your full legal name, address and date of birth, along with other personal information that is required
        to verify your identity and fulfill our legal and regulatory requirements. This information will also be used to
        transact your business and communicate with you. From time to time, we may request additional information to help
        us further assess your needs and preferences</p>

    <h2>Types of Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <p class="justify">The information we collect and maintain about you is provided during the course of your entering
        into transactions with private issuers who have engaged SecondMarket to provide certain services in the context
        of a private securities transaction or trading through SecondMarket. This Personal Information, not available
        publicly, comes from the following sources:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Information you provide to us when you fill out account opening documents, complete a form or make a
            request for services, including your name, address, age, Social Security number and/or taxpayer identification
            number, investment objectives, investment experience, assets and liabilities and/or income details and confidential
            documentation used to verify those details, telephone number, e-mail address and similar information; and
        </li>
        <li>
            Information from your transactions with us, such as your sale proceeds or investment amount.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>

    <h4>Keeping Information Safe</h4>

    <p class="justify">We limit access to the Personal Information you provide us to those employees who need access to
        that information in order to provide you with services related to the transactions you are entering into through
        the SecondMarket Sites. In keeping with industry standards and practices, we maintain appropriate physical, electronic
        and procedural safeguards, and controls designed to protect your Personal Information.</p>

    <p class="justify">We have invested in software, systems and procedures aimed at offering you a safe and secure
        transaction environment and protect your personal, financial and historical transaction information. While no
        security system is absolutely impenetrable, we plan to constantly review, refine and upgrade our security technology
        as new tools become available.</p>

    <h4>The Importance of Being Accurate</h4>

    <p class="justify">We have security standards and procedures in place designed to prevent unauthorized access to your
        Personal Information. A key part of this process helps ensure that the Personal Information we have about you is
        accurate and up-to-date. If you ever discover inaccuracies in our data or if your Personal Information changes,
        we urge you to notify us immediately.
        We only use your Personal Information as appropriate to provide you with quality services and to ensure security.
        For example, we may use the information collected from you to verify your identity and contact information.
        We may also use this information to establish and set up your trading account and maintain your trading information.
        This information helps us improve our services to you.
    </p>

    <h4>An Ongoing Commitment to Your Privacy</h4>

    <p class="justify">We are just as committed to protecting the privacy of our former clients as we are our current clients.
        If you choose to become an inactive client, your Personal Information will continue to be protected by the privacy
        policies and principles described in the then-current version of this Policy. Should you close your account with us,
        SecondMarket will retain your information for regulatory compliance, internal record-keeping and other legal purposes.</p>

    <h4>How Information Helps Both You and Us</h4>

    <p class="justify">Our mission is clear: to simplify private issuer financial transactions. Information about you and
        your accounts plays a key role in our ability to succeed in this mission. It also helps us service our private
        issuer clients and administer our business. For example, we use information about you to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
           Respond more accurately and efficiently to your requests for assistance; and
        </li>
        <li>
           Secure your accounts and help protect you and SecondMarket from fraud.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing Your Information with Unaffiliated Third Parties</h2>

    <h4>We Limit the Sharing of Information</h4>

    <p class="justify">To protect your privacy, we limit the sharing of your Personal Information outside of SecondMarket.
        We conduct our business with great respect for the confidential nature of the information being provided. We will
        not share Personal Information about you except as outlined below:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
           To help us provide our services to our private issuer clients, you and/or to improve our services, we engage
            qualified and reputable third parties to help us to carry out certain functions such as account processing,
            client services and/or data collection relevant to our business. For example, in each case where you enter
            into a financial transaction through a SecondMarket Site, we share your Personal Information with third party
            service providers in order to perform regulatory-required background checks, with certain technology providers
            to facilitate document execution, and with third parties that perform securities execution and clearing services
            on your behalf. Pursuant to our agreements with these service providers, their ability to use your Personal
            Information is specifically limited to the service being provided.
        </li>

        <li>
           To the extent that you upload Personal Information and sign transactional documentation via a SecondMarket
            Site in connection with an investment, sale of equity or other transaction, we may share your Personal
            Information and the documentation that you execute with the parties with which you are transacting.
        </li>

        <li>
           As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger,
            reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Information may be part of the transferred assets.
        </li>

        <li>
           SecondMarket may share information with our affiliates if the information is required to provide the services
            you request. An affiliate is a company that we own or control, or with which there is common ownership with us.
        </li>

        <li>
            SecondMarket also reserves the right to disclose your personal information where required by law to regulatory,
            law enforcement or other government authorities, including during routine regulatory examinations. We may also
            disclose your information as necessary to credit reporting or collection agencies, or when necessary to protect
            our rights or property.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Reviewing, Changing or Correcting Information</h2>

    <p class="justify">You are responsible for helping us to maintain the accuracy and completeness of your Personal Information
        and other data. We urge you to review your information regularly to ensure that it is correct and complete. If you would
        like to review your Personal Information or if you believe that any of your Personal Information is incorrect, or if you
        have any questions regarding your Personal Information, or this Privacy Policy, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:legal@secondmarket.com">legal@secondmarket.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Third Party Sites</h2>

    <p class="justify">If at any time you choose to purchase a product or service offered by another company, any Personal
        Information you share with that company will by subject to the privacy policies of the applicable third party companies
        and will not be controlled by our Privacy Policy.
        Other than as described above, we are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of third party sites
        and/or services (each, a “Third Party Service”) we link to, and have no control of the use or protection of information
        provided by you or collected by those Third Party Services. Whenever you elect to hyperlink to a Third Party Service,
        you may be asked to provide registration or other information. Please note that the information you are providing is
        going to a third-party, and you should familiarize yourself with the privacy policy provided by that party.
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy and the Internet</h2>
    
    <p class="justify">The following additional information will be of interest to you if you access a SecondMarket Site
        and/or one of its affiliates' products or services through one or more of our websites:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p class="justify">

            Generally, identification and authentication take place through the use of your user name and a password and/or
            while logging in with one of our technical support staff.
           </p>
        </li><li>
        <p class="justify">
            The SecondMarket Sites are built upon an infrastructure with multiple layers of protection, including physical
            security of our equipment to system intrusion detection capabilities. Within such our sites, we use industry
            standard encryption technologies to help safeguard your information.

            Security is a cooperative effort between us and the users of the SecondMarket Sites. Please remember that your

            you should discontinue their use and notify us if you have any reason to suspect that someone else may be using them.

            Please note that if you decline to use cookies, you may experience reduced functionality, slower site response times,

            This may be accomplished by using cookies, Web beacons, page tags or similar tools that are set when you visit
