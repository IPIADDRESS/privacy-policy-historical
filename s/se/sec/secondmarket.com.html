        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how SecondMarket Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively,
            "SecondMarket", "We", "Our", "Us") collect and protect your personal
            information. If you have any questions that this policy does not address, please contact us at 212.668.5920. By
            opening an account with SecondMarket Inc., a registered broker-dealer subsidiary of SecondMarket Holdings, Inc.,
            or by otherwise submitting personal information to us, you give your consent to the collection and use of
            personal information by SecondMarket as explained in this policy.</p>

        <p>SecondMarket's Privacy Policy applies to current and former SecondMarket Inc. clients and any other users of
            any SecondMarket Holdings website. The term "personal information" as used herein refers to non-public

            client name.</p>

        <p>You can count on us to protect the privacy of the information you have entrusted to us and to provide you with
            the responsive, professional service you deserve.</p>

        <h2>Our Pledge to You</h2>

        <p>We recognize that the trust of our clients is our most precious asset. SecondMarket is committed to maintaining
            the confidentiality, integrity and security of personal information regarding our clients. Keeping client
            information secure, and using it only as our clients want us to, are matters of principle for all of us at
            SecondMarket. With this in mind, here is our pledge to each and every SecondMarket Inc. client and user of any
            SecondMarket Holdings website:</p>

        <p>We Will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Respect the trust you place in us and the confidential nature of the information you provide through your
                financial relationship with us;
            </li>
            <li>
                Except as you may otherwise expressly approve, limit the collection and use of client and user information
                to what we believe would be useful to service your accounts, administer our business, or tell you about our
                services;
            </li>
            <li>
                Restrict employee access to client and user information to those who need to know in order to provide
                services to you;
            </li>
            <li>
                Educate our employees to reinforce the importance of confidentiality and client and user privacy;
            </li>
            <li>
                Maintain appropriate security standards and procedures to protect information about you; and
            </li>
            <li>
                Respond quickly to your request to correct inaccurate information.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Updates and Changes to SecondMarket Inc. Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>Please note that, in the event of a change in policy, a revised Privacy Policy will promptly be posted to our
            Website. You agree to accept posting of a revised Privacy Policy electronically on the such SecondMarket
            Holdings Site as actual notice to you. Any dispute over our Privacy Policy is subject to this notice.</p>

        <h2>How and Why We Gather Information</h2>

        <p><em>SecondMarket does not sell personal information about its clients or users to anyone.</em></p>

        <p>We collect information from you that is required to open an account, to transact business, to communicate with
            you, verify your identity and fulfill legal and regulatory requirements. We call this your “Profile.”
            From time to time, we may request additional information (e.g., through surveys) to help us further assess your
            needs and preferences.</p>

        <p>We also offer the option to allow you to share certain information with other clients and users of the
            SecondMarket Platform. You can share your profile with everyone on the SecondMarket Platform, or only with
            members whom you designate as “Trusted Connections.” You are not required to select anyone as
            a “Trusted Connection”, and thus you do not have to share your Profile with anyone other than
            SecondMarket employees and contractors who have a need to know your Profile information in order to service your
            account. Anyone you do designate as a “Trusted Connection”, will be able to see your bidding,
            offering and trading activity in addition to your Profile. In the event you indicate an interest to buy a
            particular asset, we will notify the issuer of that asset of your interest, unless you deselect the box next to
            the words "Share your name and interest to buy with [Name of Issuer]".</p>

        <h2>Types of Information We Collect</h2>

        <p>The information we collect and maintain about you comes primarily from you during the course of your doing
            business with SecondMarket Inc. This personal information, not available publicly, comes from the following
            sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> Information you provide to us when you fill out account opening documents, complete a form or make a
                    request for services, including your name, address, age, Social Security number and/or taxpayer
                    identification number, investment objectives, investment experience, assets and income, telephone
                    number, e-mail address and similar information;</p>
            </li><li>
                <p> Information from your transactions with us, such as your account balance and account usage; and</p>
            </li><li>
                <p> Information obtained from others, such as credit reporting agencies.</p>
        </li></ul>
        <h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>

        <p><em>SecondMarket considers the protection of sensitive information to be a foundation of client trust.</em></p>

        <p>Keeping Information Safe</p>

        <p>We limit access to the information we have about you to those employees who need to know to provide you with
            services to help you meet your financial needs. In keeping with industry standards and practices, we maintain
            appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards and controls to protect your information.</p>

        <p>We have invested in software, systems and procedures to offer you a safe and secure trading environment and
            protect your personal, financial and trading information. While no security system is absolutely impenetrable,
            we plan to constantly review, refine and upgrade our security technology as new tools become available.</p>

        <p>The Importance of Being Accurate</p>

        <p>We have security standards and procedures in place designed to prevent unauthorized access to your accounts and
            personal information. A key part of this process helps ensure that all information we have about you is accurate
            and up-to-date. If you ever discover inaccuracies in our data or if your personal information changes, we urge
            you to notify us immediately.</p>

        <p>We only use your information as appropriate to provide you with quality services and to ensure security. For
            example, we may use the information collected from you to verify your identity and contact information. We may
            also use this information to establish and set up your trading account, issue an account number, and maintain
            your trading information. This information helps us improve our services to you.</p>

        <p>An Ongoing Commitment to Your Privacy</p>

        <p>We are just as committed to protecting the privacy of our former clients as we are our current clients. If you
            choose to become an inactive client, you will continue to be protected by the privacy policies and principles
            described in this policy. Should you close your account with us, SecondMarket Inc. will retain your information,
            but only use it to comply with regulatory requirements.</p>

        <p>How Information Helps Both You and Us</p>

        <p>Our mission is clear: to help you reach your financial goals. Information about you and your accounts plays a key
            role in our ability to succeed in this mission. It also helps us service your accounts and administer our
            business. For example, we use information about you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Respond more accurately and efficiently to your requests;
            </li>
            <li>
                Identify opportunities to give you more convenience and control by developing new services that may benefit
                you; and
            </li>
            <li>
                Secure your accounts and help protect you and SecondMarket Inc. from fraud.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sharing Your Information with Unaffiliated Third Parties</h2>

        <p>We Limit the Sharing Information</p>

        <p>To protect your privacy, we limit the sharing of information outside SecondMarket. We conduct our business with
            great respect for the confidential nature of the information being provided. We will not share information about
            you except as outlined below.</p>

        <p>The cornerstone of our Privacy Policy is the commitment to keep our clients' personal information confidential.
            We do not sell, license, lease or otherwise disclose your personal information to any unaffiliated third party
            for any reason, except as noted below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Where such disclosure is required or appropriate pursuant to laws or securities regulations, including
                cooperating with government agencies, other regulatory bodies and law enforcement officials, performing
                background checks, resolving disputes or performing risk-management functions.
            </li>
            <li>
                To help us improve our services to you, we may engage another business to help us to carry out certain
                internal functions such as account processing, client services or other data collection relevant to our
                business. Use of the information shared is strictly limited to the performance of the task we request and
                for no other purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the event you indicate an interest to buy a particular asset, we will notify the issuer of that asset of
                your interest, unless you deselect the box next to the words "Share your name and interest to buy with [Name
                of Issuer]".
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples of the types of outside companies with which we may share information include non-financial companies
            that perform services for us, such as data processing and companies that perform securities execution and
            clearing services on our behalf. SecondMarket Inc. has entered into contractual arrangements with Penson
            Financial Services, Inc. ("Penson") to provide clearing and settlement services, and Continental Stock
            Transfer and Trust Company for escrow services to SecondMarket Inc. and its clients. SecondMarket Inc. may
            provide client information to either of these entities when it is necessary to do so to service and settle
            trades on a timely basis.</p>

        <p>SecondMarket Inc. may share information with affiliates if the information is required to provide the services
            you requested. An affiliate is a company that we own or control, or with which there is common ownership with
            us.</p>

        <p>All third parties with which we share personal information are required to protect it in a manner similar to the
            way we protect information. If at any time you choose to purchase a product or service offered by another
            company, any personal information you share with that company will no longer be controlled under our Privacy
            Policy.</p>

        <p>As noted above, SecondMarket Inc. also reserves the right to disclose your personal information where required by
            law to regulatory, law enforcement or other government authorities. We may also disclose your information as
            necessary to credit reporting or collection agencies, or when necessary to protect our rights or property.</p>

        <h2>Reviewing, Changing or Correcting Information</h2>

        <p>You are responsible for helping us to maintain the accuracy and completeness of your personal and other
            information. We urge you to review your information regularly to ensure that it is correct and complete. If you
            would like to review your personal information or if you believe that any of your information is incorrect, or
            if you have any questions regarding your personal information, or this Privacy Policy, please contact us at
            212.668.5920.</p>

        <h2>Our Privacy Policy Statement Does Not Apply to Third Party Sites, including Sites, if any, to Which We Link</h2>

        <p>If at any time you choose to purchase a product or service offered by another company, any personal information
            you share with that company will not be controlled under our Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of sites we link to, and have no control of the
            use or protection of information provided by you or collected by those sites. Whenever you elect to hyperlink to
            a linked Website, you may be asked to provide registration or other information. Please note that the
            information you are providing is going to a third-party, and you should familiarize yourself with the privacy
            policy provided by that party.</p>

        <h2>Privacy and the Internet</h2>

            affiliates products or services through one or more of our websites:</p>
