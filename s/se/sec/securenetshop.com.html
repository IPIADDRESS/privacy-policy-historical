					<!-- TOS START -->
					<!-- Title=Privacy Policy -->

					<p><strong>Our Commitment To Privacy</strong><br>SecureNetShop.com, LLC is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of visitors to our web 
					site as well as the privacy of our actual customers. This policy explains what information is collected from visitors and customers and how we make use of such information.

					terms of our policy.</p>

When you visit our web site, our web server collects basic user information about you that may include your IP address, the domain from which you originated, the time you accessed our web site, and the pages from within our web site that you visit.</p>
							
							<p>We may at times also use cookies, which are small pieces of information that a web site can store 
							in a designated file on your computer. Cookies may be used to help manage sessions within various web 
							applications, track referrals from select third parties or to tailor a specific operation to your needs, 
							likes, and dislikes.</p>
							
							<p>We may collect personally identifiable information from customers in a variety of ways, including 
							through online forms for ordering products and services, and other instances where customers are invited 
							to volunteer such information. While not all of the information we collect from customers is personally 
							identifiable, it may be associated with personally identifiable information that customers provide us 
							through our web site.</p>
							
							<p><strong>How We Use Information</strong><br>
							The basic user information collected from visitors to our web site is used to help us analyze web traffic,

							the content of our web site.</p>
							
							<p>We will occasionally send our customers emails regarding scheduled maintenance, policy changes or new 
							features and upgrades to our services. Customers are required to receive emails of this nature due to the 
							importance and direct impact they may have on our customers' accounts. Customers who have cancelled service
							with SecureNetShop.com, LLC will not receive emails of this kind.</p>
							
							<p>We may also send our customers emails regarding products and services offered by SecureNetShop.com, LLC 
							or select third parties. However, such emails will always provide recipients with the ability to opt-out 
							of future mailings.</p>
							
							<p><strong>Disclosure</strong><br>
							We may from time to time disclose to third parties aggregate, anonymous information on our web site's traffic 
							profile. For example, Internet advertising companies may require this data to help us better target our

							information when (a) it is necessary to protect the legitimate 
							interests of SecureNetShop.com, LLC and its customers, (b) it is required to cooperate with interception orders, 
							warrants, subpoenas or other legal process that we determine, in our sole discretion, to be valid and 
							enforceable, (c) it is necessary to provide to a law enforcement agency when the contents are inadvertently 
							obtained by SecureNetShop.com, LLC and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime, (d) we have reason to 
							believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action 
							against a customer, should we determine, in our sole discretion, customer is causing harm or interfering 
							with the rights or property of SecureNetShop.com, LLC, our customers, or others, or where we have a good 
							faith belief that the law requires such disclosure. Lastly, we disclose our customers' company names, the 
							dates in which our customers purchase or renew services and the amounts paid for such services to trusted 
							affiliates and partners. At no time will our database of customers ever be sold to any entity for the purpose 
							of marketing or mailing lists.</p>

							those provisions listed in this document. We are not responsible for the collection, use or disclosure of 
							information collected on these external web sites and we expressly disclaim any and all liability related
