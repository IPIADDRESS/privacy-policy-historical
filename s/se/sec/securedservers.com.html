<div class="bodyText" style="width:80%">This privacy policy only applies to this website. It does not apply to any websites that might be operated by Secured Servers' clients or their clients. Secured Servers' clients may or may not have their own privacy policy. If you have questions about a Secured Servers' client's privacy policy you must contact that client directly. Secured Servers expressly denies any responsibility for any information that you provide to a Secured Servers client or a client of a Secured Servers client.

<h2>Our Commitment to Privacy:</h2>
SECURED SERVERS, LLC Is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to this Web site ("Site") and other SECURED SERVERS Web sites. To accomplish this, we have implemented a comprehensive Privacy Policy that governs all information collected on or submitted to our Site. By accessing, browsing or using the Site, you acknowledge that you read, understand, and agree to the terms and conditions of Secured Servers' Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not access, browse, or use this Site.
<br>
<br>
<h2>The Information We Collect and How We Use It:</h2>
1. Non-Personal and Aggregated Information. When you visit our Site, we may log general data, such as your domain name (e.g., www.securedservers.com), the name of the Web page from which you entered our Site, which pages you visit on our Site, and how much time you spend on each page. We use this information to continually monitor and improve our Site and for internal analysis. In particular, we use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement, and gather information for aggregate use. (IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.)
<br>
<br>
2. Personal Information. As a visitor to our Site, you may choose to use the Site to send us personal information (e.g., your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address), for example, when you send a question via the Site, register for a particular service, or submit your resume through our Site. Anytime you submit personal information for a specific purpose using the Site, your information is used for that purpose only, unless you consent otherwise or as required by law. When you submit personal information to SECURED SERVERS on this Site, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in another country, which may not provide privacy protections similar to those your country provides.
<br>
<br>
We do not send unsolicited e-mail to you or other visitors to our Site. We use e-mail to respond to e-mail messages from you, to confirm product or service orders placed online and to engage other communication that you have authorized or that we have determined necessary to more effectively service you and our customers.
<br>
<br>
In many cases, you choose the amount of information you supply (e.g., when sending us information through the Site, you may choose to include only an e-mail address - not a telephone number or mailing address - for replies). There may be instances where some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. In such cases, if you do not provide mandatory personal information with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Cookies:</h2>
The term "cookie" refers to files that are transferred from a Web site to your computer's hard drive. SECURED SERVERS does not use cookies, except as expressly set forth in this Privacy Policy.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Who We Share It With:</h2>
We may share non-personal, aggregated information with our customers, partners, and advertisers. Aggregated information is not linked to any personal information that can identify an individual person or website.
<br>
<br>
Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we only share the personal information you provide through our Site with SECURED SERVERS affiliates and/or business partners that are acting on our behalf. We make every reasonable effort to ensure that such SECURED SERVERS affiliates and business partners, including those in the U.S. and/or any other countries, protect your personal information consistent with our Privacy Policy.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Our Commitment To Data Security:</h2>
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect through the Site. However, please be advised that SECURED SERVERS cannot and does not guarantee and has no control over the public or third party network through which you send your personal information to Secured Servers' Site.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</h2>
Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Site is structured to attract anyone under 13.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Linked Internet Web Sites:</h2>
This Site provides hyperlinks that, when clicked, take you to another place within the document, to another document altogether, or to other Web sites not controlled by SECURED SERVERS. These hyper-linked Web sites may contain privacy provisions that are different from those provided herein. SECURED SERVERS is not responsible for the collection, use or disclosure of information collected through these Web sites, and SECURED SERVERS expressly disclaims any and all liability related to such collection, use, or disclosure.
<br>
<br>
<h2>How To Correct, Amend, or Delete Your Information:</h2>
We honor requests from you to correct, amend, or delete your account information (for example, your name, address, or billing information). You may verify that appropriate corrections have been made. To correct, amend or delete account information, contact support@securedservers.com. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. Privacy Policy Changes:
