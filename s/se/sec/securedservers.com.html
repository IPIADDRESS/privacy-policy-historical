            <b>Privacy Policy</b><br>
            <br>
            This privacy policy only applies to this website. It does not apply 
            to any websites that might be operated by Secured Servers’ clients 
            or their clients. Secured Servers’ clients may or may not have 
            their own privacy policy. If you have questions about a Secured Servers’ 
            client’s privacy policy you must contact that client directly. 
            Secured Servers expressly denies any responsibility for any information 
            that you provide to a Secured Servers client or a client of a Secured 
            Servers client.
            <p><b>Our Commitment To Privacy: </b></p>
            <p>SECURED SERVERS, LLC. Is committed to protecting the privacy of 
              visitors to this Web site ("Site") and other SECURED SERVERS 
              Web sites. To accomplish this, we have implemented a comprehensive 
              Privacy Policy that governs all information collected on or submitted 
              to our Site. By accessing, browsing or using the Site, you acknowledge 
              that you read, understand, and agree to the terms and conditions 
              of Secured Servers’ Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to 
              these terms and conditions, please do not access, browse, or use 
              this Site. </p>
            <p>The Information We Collect and How We Use It: </p>
            <p><b>1. Non-Personal and Aggregated Information</b>. When you visit 
              our Site, we may log general data, such as your domain name (e.g., 
              www.securedservers.com), the name of the Web page from which you 
              entered our Site, which pages you visit on our Site, and how much 
              time you spend on each page. We use this information to continually 
              monitor and improve our Site and for internal analysis. In particular, 
              we use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track 
              user's movement, and gather information for aggregate use. (IP addresses 
              are not linked to personally identifiable information.) </p>
            <p><b>2. Personal Information</b>. As a visitor to our Site, you may 
              choose to use the Site to send us personal information (e.g., your 
              name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address), for example, 
              when you send a question via the Site, register for a particular 
              service, or submit your resume through our Site. Anytime you submit 
              personal information for a specific purpose using the Site, your 
              information is used for that purpose only, unless you consent otherwise 
              or as required by law. When you submit personal information to SECURED 
              SERVERS on this Site, you understand and agree that this information 
              may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored 
              and processed in another country, which may not provide privacy 
              protections similar to those your country provides.</p>
            <p>We do not send unsolicited e-mail to you or other visitors to our 
              Site. We use e-mail to respond to e-mail messages from you, to confirm 
              product or service orders placed online and to engage in other communication 
              that you have authorized or that we have determined necessary to 
              more effectively service you and our customers. </p>
            <p>In many cases, you choose the amount of information you supply 
              (e.g., when sending us information through the Site, you may choose 
              to include only an e-mail address - not a telephone number or mailing 
              address - for replies). There may be instances where some of the 
              information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory 
              and some as voluntary. In such cases, if you do not provide mandatory 
              personal information with respect to a particular activity, you 
              will not be able to engage in that activity. </p>
            <p><b>Cookies </b></p>
            <p>The term "cookie" refers to files that are transferred 
              from a Web site to your computer's hard drive. <br>
              SECURED SERVERS does not use cookies except as expressly set forth 
              in this Privacy Policy. </p>
            <p><b>Who We Share It With: </b></p>
            <p>We may share non-personal, aggregated information with our customers, 
              partners, and advertisers. Aggregated information is not linked 
              to any personal information that can identify an individual person 
              or website. </p>
            <p>Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we only 
              share the personal information you provide through our Site with 
              SECURED SERVERS affiliates and/or business partners that are acting 
              on our behalf. We make every reasonable effort to ensure that such 
              SECURED SERVERS affiliates and business partners, including those 
              in the U.S. and/or any other countries, protect your personal information 
              consistent with our Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p><b>Our Commitment To Data Security:</b></p>
            <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure 
              the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate 
              physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and 
              secure the information we collect through the Site. However, please 
              be advised that SECURED SERVERS cannot and does not guarantee and 
              has no control over the public or third party network through which 
              you send your personal information to Secured Servers’ Site.</p>
            <p><b>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy: </b></p>
            <p>Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. For 
              that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Site 
              from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Site 
              is structured to attract anyone under 13. </p>
            <p><b>Linked Internet Web Sites:</b></p>
            <p>This Site provides hyperlinks that, when clicked, take you to another 
              place within the document, to another document altogether, or to 
              other Web sites not controlled by SECURED SERVERS. These hyper-linked 
              Web sites may contain privacy provisions that are different from 
              those provided herein. SECURED SERVERS is not responsible for the 
              collection, use or disclosure of information collected through these 
              Web sites, and SECURED SERVERS expressly disclaims any and all liability 
              related to such collection, use, or disclosure.</p>
            <p><b>How To Correct, Amend, or Delete Your Information:</b> </p>
            <p>We honor requests from you to correct, amend, or delete your account 
              information (for example, your name, address, or billing information). 
              You may verify that appropriate corrections have been made. To correct, 
              amend or delete account information, contact <a href="mailto:support@securedservers.com" class="bodyLink">support@securedservers.com</a>. 
              To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable 
              steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>
            <p><b>Privacy Policy Changes</b></p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy is subject to change. Any changes to Secured 
              Servers’ Privacy Policy will be posted on the Site. All information 
              submitted through the Site to SECURED SERVERS is subject to the 
              terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, as amended. </p>
