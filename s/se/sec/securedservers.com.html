          <strong>Our Commitment To Privacy: </strong><br>
          SECURED SERVERS, LLC. Is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors 
          to this Web site ("Site") and other SECURED SERVERS Web sites. 
          To accomplish this, we have implemented a comprehensive Privacy Policy 
          that governs all information collected on or submitted to our Site. 
          By accessing, browsing or using the Site, you acknowledge that you read, 
          understand, and agree to the terms and conditions of Secured Servers’ 
          Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please 
          do not access, browse, or use this Site. </font></p>

          <strong>The Information We Collect and How We Use It: </strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          <strong>1. Non-Personal and Aggregated Information.</strong> When you 
          visit our Site, we may log general data, such as your domain name (e.g., 
          www.securedservers.com), the name of the Web page from which you entered 
          our Site, which pages you visit on our Site, and how much time you spend 
          on each page. We use this information to continually monitor and improve 
          our Site and for internal analysis. In particular, we use IP addresses 
          to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement, and gather 
          information for aggregate use. (IP addresses are not linked to personally 
          identifiable information.) </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          <strong>2. Personal Information.</strong> As a visitor to our Site, 
          you may choose to use the Site to send us personal information (e.g., 
          your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address), for example, 
          when you send a question via the Site, register for a particular service, 
          or submit your resume through our Site. Anytime you submit personal 
          information for a specific purpose using the Site, your information 
          is used for that purpose only, unless you consent otherwise or as required 
          by law. When you submit personal information to SECURED SERVERS on this 
          Site, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred 
          across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in another 
          country, which may not provide privacy protections similar to those 
          your country provides.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          We do not send unsolicited e-mail to you or other visitors to our Site. 
          We use e-mail to respond to e-mail messages from you, to confirm product 
          or service orders placed online and to engage in other communication 
          that you have authorized or that we have determined necessary to more 
          effectively service you and our customers. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          In many cases, you choose the amount of information you supply (e.g., 
          when sending us information through the Site, you may choose to include 
          only an e-mail address - not a telephone number or mailing address - 
          for replies). There may be instances where some of the information that 
          we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. 
          In such cases, if you do not provide mandatory personal information 
          with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage 
          in that activity. </font></p>
