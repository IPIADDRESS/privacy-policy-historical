<h3><strong>Description of Service</strong></h3>
<p>Kaspersky VirusDesk is a web page designed to scan files and URLs for viruses and provide you with scanning results, to help us improve our detection methods in your best interest and at the same time provide you with additional information regarding any files or URLs that might in fact either be:</p>
<p>a) malicious, but which Kaspersky Lab’s antivirus software has not detected and/or rated as malicious (“Infected”), or<br>b) clean, but which Kaspersky Lab’s antivirus software has erroneously rated as malicious (“False Alarm”).</p>
<p>For this purpose, Kaspersky VirusDesk allows you to upload a file (of up to 50 MB of size) to our servers or to provide us with a URL address to have them checked for known potential malware infection and to allow our experts at Kaspersky Anti-Virus Lab to perform further scans and analyses of the content in that regard.</p>
<p>We at Kaspersky Lab respect your desire to protect personal information. Therefore, we will only gather and use personal information required for a full-scale operation of Kaspersky Virus Desk.</p>
<p>You make all decisions regarding whether or not to provide personal data. However, please note that if you do not wish to provide the necessary information, you may not be able to use Kaspersky Virus Desk. For example, if a file you want to upload for scanning contains personal data, it is solely your responsibility to assess and decide whether you want to and are allowed to share the data with us. We at Kaspersky Lab will solely use such data for the purpose of scanning and analyzing it for possible malware infection, but we cannot take responsibility regarding your right to share them with us in the first place.</p>
<p>If you do not agree to the results of scanning and would like to receive feedback regarding the possible malware infection of information you have provided to us, you can enter your email address after clicking on “I disagree with the scan results” and checking on “I want to receive an email notification”. We will use your email address in order to provide you with such results and to provide you with customer support services based on your previous requests.</p>
<h3><strong>How long do we keep your personal data</strong></h3>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Description of Service</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Account registration</em></strong>. To use CompanyAccount and access all of its features, you must create:</p>
<ul>
<li>personal account</li>
<li>an account for your company, unless your coworkers have done this previously</li>
</ul>
<p>This will require that you provide your corporate email address (which will be your username), password, first and last name, company name and country, and your company's license to use Kaspersky Lab applications. We will process and use this information solely for the purpose of providing you with CompanyAccount services and technical support, unless you explicitly choose to have it processed and used for other purposes. After registration your personal account will be linked to your company's account. If your company's account was previously created, then your registration information (first and last name and corporate email address) will be sent to the CompanyAccount Administrator from your company. The company employee who first registers the company and a personal account is typically designated as the Administrator.</p>
<p><strong><em>Account settings. </em></strong>You can at any time view, update, correct your account information and password, or delete your account on the "My account" tab. Your company's CompanyAccount Administrator will also be able to change your account settings and reset your password.

<p><strong><em>Licenses</em></strong>. You can add and view your company's licenses to Kaspersky Lab products on the "Licenses" tab of your CompanyAccount (activation codes or key files for each product). The license provided during registration will be added automatically to your company's CompanyAccount. Key files are not physically stored on CompanyAccount. The system only stores a record about your company's license. Every company employee with a personal account linked to your company's CompanyAccount has access to the list of licenses. Your CompanyAccount Administrator can remove your company's licenses by deleting them from the list.</p>

The list of contracts will be available to those company employees who were designated as authorized to use the paid service at the time of purchase. These people will automatically receive notifications about the expiration of the contract.</p>
<p><strong><em>Customer support requests. </em></strong>If you contact Customer Support or the Anti-Virus Lab team for support through CompanyAccount, we may ask you to submit information we may require for providing assistance to you. For example, this may include information about the product associated with your request, computer hardware, your company's network, software, and the nature of the problem you've encountered. Moreover, it may be helpful or even necessary for you to send us the files you are having trouble with or files that define the configuration of your computer or network. You can do this by using the "Attach files" option in the request form. These files may contain user-specific or otherwise personally-identifiable file names, metadata, or content. It is always your choice whether to upload these files. If you would like to upload files, please first view and accept our <a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/support/rdp?cid=ca&amp;utm_source=companyaccount.kaspersky.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=company_account&amp;utm_content=en">Regulation on data provisioning</a> on the file upload page. In order to choose the correct customer support department for your request, we will use information about your company's licenses, country, and possibly the interface language selected in your CompanyAccount. Your colleagues may have access to your requests if your CompanyAccount Administrator manually changes the corresponding settings (the Administrator can view requests automatically).</p>
<h3><strong>How long do we keep your personal data</strong></h3>
