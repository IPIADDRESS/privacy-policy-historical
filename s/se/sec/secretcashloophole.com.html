      <p><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>

      <p>Last Updated: June 6, 2008</p>

      <p>secretcashloophole.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of 
        Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. 
        We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, 
        street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy 
        policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any 
        unauthorized third party. Period."</p>

      <p>How we gather information from users</p>

      <p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, 

        the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. 

        For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register 

        for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, 

        such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information 

        when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat 

        rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, secretcashloophole.com 

        also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic 

        tools that may be transparent to our visitors. </p>

      <p>For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or 

        use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your 

        visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, 

        sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, 

        or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement 

        while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also 

        gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose 

        not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser 

        to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access 

        certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name 

        and password, and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features 

        according to your preferences.</p>

      <p>What we do with the information we collect</p>

      <p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit 
        and deliver more individualized content and advertising. </p>

      <p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on secretcashloophole.com 
        to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; 
        our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered 
        by secretcashloophole.com and other topics we think you may find of interest. 
      </p>

      <p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by secretcashloophole.com may 
        also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, 
        troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration 
        of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you by us or 
        other parties who we may from time to time share your information with. 
        Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation 
        of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. 
        We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from 
        time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, 
        merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, 
        user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose 
        your information in response to a court order, at other times when we 
        believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with 
        the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement 
        authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note 
        we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
