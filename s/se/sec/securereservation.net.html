                            <p align="justify">  We highly value your trust in choosing DHD Hospitality Inc (securereservation.net) for your online hotel reservation. Therefore, we will duly and diligently safeguard and protect the privacy and confidentiality of your personal details (including your credit card details).</p>
<p align="justify">This privacy policy applies to all of our services (whether accessed or made available online or through any other platform or device (hereafter collectively referred to as the "website")).</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Information Collection</strong><br>
  When you make a reservation for a hotel (or any other type of accommodation), you will be asked to complete online forms providing: your name, (home or office) address, (business or private) email address, (cell, home or office) telephone number, credit card details (i.e. credit card type and number, CVC code, expiration date, credit card holder name) and to the extent available, reservation preferences and smoking preference. This information is required to process, book and complete your reservation (including the sending of a confirmation email of the booking to you).</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Disclosure of Personal Details</strong><br>
  For our services, we shall collect for the following purposes the following information:</p>
<p align="justify">Reservation Orders: For the purposes of completing your booking and save for disclosures required by law, criminal investigations, subpoenas or court orders, we will only disclose your name, contact details and the credit card details to the relevant hotel with which a booking is made. However, please note that from time to time, we may use third party distributors which provide certain services and functions for and on our behalf. These third party distributors may have access to (part of your) personal information in order to perform their services and functions, but are subject to a confidentiality obligation pursuant to which they cannot use, share or disclose the information for any other purpose.</p>
<p align="justify">Surveys: By completing a booking, you agree to receive an email with an invitation to complete our guest review form. We send you this email shortly after your stay at the hotel, and the guest review form can be completed anonymously. By completing the guest review, you agree that the completed guest review can be uploaded to and used on our website on the relevant hotel information page and on such other platforms and social media (wholly or partly) owned, controlled, managed or hosted by us or our trusted business partners for the sole purpose of informing (future) customers on the service (level) and quality of the relevant hotel. We reserve the right to adjust, refuse or remove review forms at our sole discretion. The guest review form should be regarded as a survey and does not include any (further commercial) offers, invitations or incentives whatsoever.</p>

<p align="justify">Furthermore, we will use Non-PII for behavioral targeting. We will also maintain a record of Non-PII for the purposes of potential legal investigations involving fraud, misuse and criminal investigation.</p>
<p align="justify">Please note that from time to time, we may use third party service providers for marketing analysis and quality improvement purposes (the "Service Providers"). We may also use Service Providers to track detailed visitor activity on specific pages.
