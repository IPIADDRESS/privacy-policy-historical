  <div class="document"><h1>Your Privacy</h1>  <p><em>Last Revised: July 11, 2014</em></p>  <p>Welcome to Secret -- The app that allows you to secretly share with others from Secret, Inc. (“Secret,” “we,” “us” or “our”).</p>  <p>This privacy policy explains how we collect, use and disclose information about you when you use our mobile application (the “App”), our Web site (the “Site”) and other online products and services that link to this privacy policy (collectively, the “Service”).  By using the Service, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this privacy policy.  </p><p>Through the Service, you can secretly share messages, pictures, comments and other content (“Posts”) with certain other users of the Service. When you share a Post through the app, you are secretly sharing your Post with the contacts that you have stored on your mobile device each time you access our Service who also register with our Service (your “Friends”).  In addition, each time a user “loves” a Post, that Post is shared with all the contacts of that user (“Friends of Friends”) and so on.  People who can see your Posts because they have been loved by Friends, Friends of Friends and so on are considered in your “Network.” We may also choose to feature certain Posts, in which case such Posts may be secretly shared with all users of the Service.</p>  <p>For more information about the Service, please see our <a href="/faq">FAQ page</a>.</p>  <h2>Modifications</h2> <p>We may change this privacy policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the privacy policy periodically to stay informed about our practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.</p>  <h2>Collection of Information</h2> <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3> <p>We collect information you directly give us. For example, we collect information about you when you sign up for our Service, make a Post, give feedback about the Service or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your email address, mobile phone number and any other information you choose to provide. When you request the App to find your Friends, we also collect certain information from your contacts on your mobile device, including your contacts’ email addresses and phone numbers, so you can secretly share your Posts with people you know who are already using the App.  However, we hash your contacts email address and phone number before they leave your mobile device so we do not have access to that information.  For information as to how to restrict the collection of contact information, please see the “Your Choices” section below. We may also collect information about you from other users of the Services (for eg. we may collect your contact details from other users if such details are stored on the user's mobile device).  If you choose not to provide certain information, we may not be able to provide the Service to you or certain features of the Service may be unavailable or work differently. </p>  <h3>Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Service</h3> <p>When you access or use our Service, we automatically collect information about you. This information is solely used by us for debugging and analytical purposes (e.g., to enhance the Service), and it includes:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Log Information:</strong> We log information about your use of the Service, including the type of browser you use, access times, IP address, Posts and pages viewed, Posts “loved,” and the page you visited before navigating to our Service.<strong><i>This data is not stored permanently,</i></strong> and only kept for no more than seven days for debugging purposes only.</li> <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect information about the mobile device you use to access our Service, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers and mobile network information. <strong><i>This data is not stored,</i></strong> and only used to determine the version of your client in order to best visual experience.</li> <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> We may collect information about the general location of your Internet Service Provider based on your IP Address. If you allow Secret to access your location information, we may also collect your geolocation information.  We use this information to show you Posts from users in your Network who are located near you and to show your Posts to users in your Network who are nearby. For information as to how to restrict the collection of geolocation information, please see the “Your Choices” section below.</li> <li><strong>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:</strong> We use various technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to improve our Service and your experience, see which areas and features of our Service are popular and count visits. We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Service or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see “Your Choices” below.</li> </ul> <h2>Use of Information</h2> <p>We may use information about you for various purposes, including to:</p> <ul> <li>Provide, maintain and improve our Service;</li> <li>Provide and deliver the Service you request, process transactions and send you related information, including confirmations;</li> <li>Send you technical notices, updates, confirmations, security alerts and support and administrative messages;</li> <li>Respond to your comments, questions and requests and provide customer service;</li> <li>Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards and events offered by Secret and others, and provide news and information we think will be of interest to you;</li> <li>Monitor and analyze trends, usage and activities in connection with our Service and improve and personalize the Service;</li> <li>Personalize and improve the Service and provide advertisements, content or features that match user profiles or interests;</li> <li>Link or combine with information we get from others to help understand your needs and provide you with better service; and</li> <li>Connect you with other users in your Contacts.</li> </ul>  <h2>Storage of Information</h2> <p>The information you provide to Secret is encrypted and stored on physically secure Google servers. Some details for the technically-minded:</p> <ul> <li>Secret is hosted on Google App Engine. It’s written almost entirely in Go, but has various components in Java and Python.</li> <li>All transmission sent over the wire is encrypted with TLS.</li> <li>We use a highly-available, non-relational datastore built on top of Google’s BigTable.</li> <li>All message data is encrypted before being written to the datastore.</li> <li>Images are stored privately and securely in Google’s Cloud Storage datastore and served over TLS from Google’s image frontend service.</li> </ul> <p>Your information is stored only as long as necessary to accomplish the purposes described in this privacy policy. We store log information collected for debugging purposes in seven-day temporary storage. We store other information you provide to us for as long as you maintain an account with Secret. You may delete your account at any time. When you delete your account, your information will be deleted from our system within thirty days. Please be aware that Google has their own data backup and retention policy, so while we will not have access to your information more than thirty days after you delete your account, it may take longer for your information to be completely wiped from Google’s servers.</p>   <h2>Sharing of Information</h2> <p>We may share aggregated or de-identified information or nonpersonal about you as follows or as otherwise described in this privacy policy:</p> <ul> <li>With other users of the Service (including some whom may not be your contacts) by providing them with your secret Posts and your general location (if you have enabled us to collect your location). </li> </ul> <p>We may also share information (which may at times include personal information) about you as follows:</p> <ul> <li>With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf; </li> <li>In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of Secret assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company;</li> <li>In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;</li> <li>If the content of a Post can reasonably be considered illegal or unlawful (or it seems like the Post is being used to engage in, encourage or promote such activities), in which case we may report your identity to proper authorities in order to protect the rights, property and safety of Secret, our users and/or others; and</li> <li>With your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you through our Service that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information. </li> </ul>  <p>Note that if you choose to include information about you in your Posts, such information will be shared with other users of the Service who receive such Posts as described in this privacy policy.  We suggest that you do not include any identifiable information about you in your Posts. Also, please note that if you or other users choose to share a Post through a third party, such as Facebook, Twitter or an email client, any further collection and sharing of that Post by such third party or its users will be governed by that third party’s privacy policy, and we cannot control what any third party does with any Posts or other information that is shared with third parties.</p>  <h3>How We Respond to Subpoenas from Courts</h3> <p>While we make it difficult to do so, it is still technically possible for us to connect your Posts with your email address, phone number, or other personal data you have provided to us. This means that if a court asks us to disclose your identity, we may be compelled to do so.  If we do happen to receive a subpoena or court order requesting that we disclose your information, we will attempt contact you if reasonably feasible before we disclose any information to give you time to fight the subpoena in court.  In the United States, you may be able to fight the subpoena on the basis that it violates your First Amendment right to speak anonymously.</p>  <p>The only way to make your Posts untraceable is to use our “unlinking” feature, described in more detail below under Your Choices, which eliminates any link between your Post and your account.</p>  <h2>International Users and other countries</h2> <p>Secret participates in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor programs, and it adheres to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Service, including your IP address, Posts, Posts viewed, time spent on Posts, and conversion information.
