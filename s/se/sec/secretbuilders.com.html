	<p>SecretBuilders  is a online, virtual world where children can explore, create and interact with  each other. Their safety and privacy are  of utmost importance to us and our practices are designed to be in compliance  with the United States Federal Trade Commission's Children's Online Privacy  Protection Act (COPPA), effective April 21, 2000. Parents are strongly encouraged to participate in their children's  online activities and monitor use of e-mails and engagement in other electronic  communication. For more information  about COPPA or children's privacy, please visit <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens.html" class="link" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens.html</a> and <a href="http://www.coppa.org/" class="link" target="_blank">http://www.coppa.org/</a>.</p>
<p>The SecretBuilders Safety  Rules also provide more information about how to be safe online. Players must agree to follow these rules  before playing on SecretBuilders.</p>
              <p>The purpose of our privacy  policy is to inform you about the types of information we gather about you  online when you visit our site, how we may use that information, and whether we  disclose it to anyone.</p>              <h1 class="heading1">Personal Information</h1>
              <p>We  do NOT require any personally identifiable information that can be used to  individually identify a user offline. For example, first name and age are personal information but they do not  specifically identify you in the way full  name (first and last name), e-mail address and postal address can. Never give that kind of information to  anybody online. When registering with  SecretBuilders we ask that you NOT use your real name as your username.</p>
              <p>Players  are required to provide a valid email address upon registration only for  account maintenance purposes, such as resending lost or forgotten password. We also require registration by age group in  order to comply with federal guidelines for protecting children younger than 13  years of age. If a child selects a age  group indicating that he/she is under 13, we require a parent's email address  through which we notify the parent that his/her child has registered at our  site as required under COPPA.<span class="warning"></span></p>
              <p>If you contact us by e-mail, we use your e-mail address (which is personally identifiable information) only  to respond to your specific request or question.</p>
              <p>In  the future we may collect information such as gender and age to provide us with  valuable demographics in order to continue developing and improving our  site. Any such information will only be  used internally to improve our site and will not be used to identify a single  user.</p>
              <p>We may also collect  information vis-a-vis surveys, Build It!, questionnaires and other online  feedback. Any information collected  thus will be aggregated and will not contain any personally identifiable  information.</p>              <p class="warning"></p>
			  <h1 class="heading1">A Word About SecretBuilders In-World Communications Tools</h1>
              <p>SecretBuilders  employs various communication tools to facilitate interactivity and richness  within our online world and to enhance our safety features by eliminating, to  the extent possible, reliance on emails as a mode of communication. These in-world tools include: chat; mail from  SecretBuilders Council and Admin in response to magazine postings, contest  entries and other activities; buddy list mail and messaging; and bulletin  boards. SecretBuilders will primarily  use these modes to communicate with users regarding new features, announcements, etc. rather than email.</p>              <p>SecretBuilders  chat, internal mail and messaging, and bulletin boards are protected by a  sophisticated advanced filter technology, and selectively monitored by staff  moderators as well as peer reporters. These communications tools however are NOT moderated continuously on a  24-hour basis and some messages may get  through the filters and may be offensive to some players. The Panic Button will allow players to report  violation of rules by other players. Please read the SecretBuilders Safety Rules to ensure as much online safety as possible.</p>
			  <h1 class="heading1">Web Visit Logs</h1>

			  <h1 class="heading1">Third Parties</h1>
              <p>Personally identifiable  information will not be provided in any form to third parties except in cases  where such information is required by a service provider for our use for direct  communications with you, but such information will be restricted in all cases  exclusively to our access and use.</p>
              <p>We may disclose personally  identifiable information to third parties as required by law enforcement or  other governmental agencies, to comply with court orders, to enforce our Terms and  Conditions, or to protect the rights, property, safety of our website and other  users of the site.</p>
              <p>We may engage third parties  to assist with services related to the website, such as technical and  processing services, contest fulfillment, mailings, and analyzing website  performance.

              <p>We may  share <strong>aggregated</strong> statistical data with our sponsors, partners, or the  general public for partnership, research or marketing purposes but will never  give out data on individual users that can be personally identifiable.
