  <p class="title2 "> <!--?php echo $server_domain; ?--> Privacy Policy</p>

<p>We understand that our users are our  most valuable commercial asset. Their welfare is critical to our success and we  understand that, accordingly, we have a serious and ongoing interest in the  privacy of our users. </p>
                <p>We believe that a rational and sensible policy for the  privacy of information should shield our users to the greatest extent  reasonably possible against indiscriminate disclosure of private information,  to the extent compatible with the functionality of our service and its  commercial purposes, from those who do not have a practical need or reasonable  commercial purpose in possessing the information. This Policy explains how we  aim to protect the user's privacy and how we determine and implement the  appropriate and reasonable balance of privacy and disclosure consistent with  the practical necessities of functionality and economic viability. </p>
                <p><strong>The  Nature of the Information We Collect</strong> </p>
                <p>In order for our Services to work and  to work economically, we need to obtain from our users some personally  identifiable information which includes the user's name and email address. </p>
                <p>We also collect data that may be  considered personally identifiable in a strict sense, but is not routinely used  for individual purposes by us, (called here "technical information")  including the IP address from which you access our web site, the browser,  browser version, operating system, and screen resolution of the computer you  are using. All of these things are necessary to format our web site for your  display and to get it to your computer. We may use this information in  aggregate form to learn how best to serve the needs and interests of our users. </p>
                <p>We  occasionally use cookies to anonymously track and target the interests of our  Users to enhance the experience on our Website and/or for advertising tracking  purposes. In addition, cookies may be used on our Website for the operation of  enhanced capabilities available to members, such as instant messaging. We do  not and will not use cookies to collect private information from any User. <br>
                    <strong><br>
                    What we do with the  Information we Collect.</strong><br>
                    <br>
                  The personally-identifiable  information obtained from our users is used in a variety of ways. </p>
                <p>First, the  personally-identifiable information is used to create, modify, and maintain the  profiles of the users, to serve indexing and search utilities, to implement the  functionality of the web site, to track usage, and to make the use of its  Services enjoyable and rewarding to everyone involved in it.&nbsp; To the extent we rely on third parties to  provide such services, information is only shared with third parties working on  behalf of Crazy Protocol and under specific agreement. By submitting your information to <!--?php echo $server_domain; ?-->, you thereby consent to receive periodic email communications from Crazy Protocol, Inc. regarding the services, new product offers, promotions, announcements, and other matters.</p>
                <p>Second, we  may contact you by email or otherwise to confirm or terminate registration, to  advise you of changes in our Terms of Service, to deal with any issues particular  to you, to alert you of member communications, events services. Information  will never be sold or leased to any third party or affiliated companies.<br clear="all">
                </p>
                <p>Third, we  reserve the right to voluntarily provide any and all information to law  enforcement agencies upon request, and to comply with any or all subpoenas, all  without notice to you, whether or not compliance by us is legally required. </p>
                <p><strong>Security</strong><strong><br clear="all">
                </strong>                </p>
                <p>All  collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure  environment.&nbsp; Access to this information  is strictly limited, and the information is not accessible to the public.&nbsp; Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the  security and privacy of all member information.&nbsp;  When our purchase process asks users to enter sensitive information,  such as credit card-specific information, and when we store and transmit such  sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with SSL  encryption software.&nbsp; In addition, to  prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use  of information, we use appropriate industry standard procedures to safeguard  the confidentiality of your personal information, such as firewall, encryption,  token authentication, application proxies, monitoring technology, and adaptive  analysis of network traffic, to track abuse of our network and its data.<br>
                  <br>
                  Please be  advised that, although we take every reasonable technological precaution  available to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be  guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp; In compliance  with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable  regulatory agencies in the event that there has been an information security  breach.&nbsp; You will be notified via e-mail  in the event of such a breach.&nbsp; Please be  advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law  enforcement, determination of the scope of network damage, and to engage in  remedial measures.</p>
