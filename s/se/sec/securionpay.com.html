				<p>As we process most personal data electronically, we have taken appropriate IT organisational and technical measures (e.g. IT security) to ensure that your personal data is protected. We also regularly
					educate our employees in data protection and information security.</p>
				<p>We carefully select any third party that we engage to process your personal data. This third party is obligated to take appropriate security measures to guarantee the confidentiality and security of
					your personal data.</p>

				<h3>4. What Personal Data is Collected for What Purpose</h3>

				<p>We use your personal data to communicate with you and third parties (e.g. acquiring partner); for concluding the agreement and processing transactions with you as well as between you and the acquiring
					partner; for running the website; for billing; for market research and marketing, such as contacting you by e-mail or text messages; and to operate our IT system (e.g. hosting and maintenance). </p>
				<p>Input fields on the website that are absolutely necessary for the provision of our services are marked accordingly during registration. The disclosure of personal data in non-marked input fields on the

					we are required otherwise by applicable law. This deletion can take place immediately or in the context of periodically executed deletion runs.</p>

					information about the online preferences of visitors to the website and enable us to improve the visitor experience.</p>
				<p>Session cookies are used to uniquely assign to you or your Internet browser information stored on the webserver that are necessary when accessing the website (e.g. the online shop) during a web
					session (e.g. so that the contents of the shopping basket are not lost). Session cookies are deleted after closing your Internet browser. Permanent cookies are used to save your preferences (e.g.

					settings of your Internet browser (e.g. one month after your last visit). By using our website and the corresponding functions (e.g. language selection or auto login) you agree to the use of permanent
					cookies.</p>
				<p>You can delete existing cookies in your Internet browser at any time, and deactivate the setting of additional cookies in your browser settings. However, deactivation may affect the functionality you
					enjoy on our website.</p>
				<p>Tracking pixel (e.g. pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFS, or canvas) are small graphics (e.g. 1x1 pixel) that are loaded into your Internet browser when you open our website or HTML emails. Our
					webserver (the webserver of our hoster respectively) logs information (e.g. date and time of your web visit or your opening of the HTML e-mail) about your web access each time your Internet browser or
					e-mail program loads a tracking pixel. The tracking pixel also enables the transmission of browser data, such as information about the device you are using to access the website (e.g. screen
					resolution or IP address).</p>
				<p>We use the following tracking pixel:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA;</li>

				<h3>11. Legal Bases of Processing</h3>

				<p>The legal justification, upon which we base our processing of personal data, is stipulated in article 13(2)(a) FDPA (processing directly related to the conclusion, or the settlement, of a contract;
					corresponding to article 6(1)(b) GDPR; and article 13(1) FDPA (consent of the data subject or obligation to process by law) corresponding to article 6(1)(a) GDPR.
				</p>
				<p>We reserve the right to store the first name and surname, postal address, and e-mail address of a data subject pursuant to article 13(1) FDPA (corresponding to article 6(1)(f) GDPR) if, based on
					misuse, non-payment or similar legitimate reasons, we refuse to conclude any future contracts with data subjects.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, group entities may also process personal date pursuant to article 13(1) FDPA (corresponding to article 6(1)(f) GDPR).</p>

				<h3>12. Your Rights</h3>
				<p>Upon request, we will inform the data subject about and - if so - which personal data we process about him or her (<span class="italic">right of access</span>).</p>
				<p>At your request:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>we will cease processing personal data, in part or in full (<span class="italic">right to withdraw your consent to the processing of personal data for one or more specific purposes; right to erasure (right “to be
						forgotten”</span>)). Your request to be forgotten will also be communicated to third parties to whom we have previously forwarded your personal data.
					</li>
					<li>we will correct the relevant personal data (<span class="italic">right to rectification</span>);</li>
					<li>we will restrict the processing of the relevant personal data (<span class="italic">right to restriction of processing</span>; in this case we will only store or use your personal data to protect our own legal claims
						or the
						third party rights;
					</li>
					<li>you will receive the relevant personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format (<span class="italic">right to data portability</span>).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>To request any of the rights described in this section, for example if you no longer wish to receive our e-mail newsletters or if you wish to delete your account, please use the appropriate function on
					our website, or contact our data protection officer or an employee as described in section 2 (Contact).</p>
				<p>If we do not comply with your request, we will inform you of the reasons for our non-compliance. For example, we may legally refuse to delete your personal data if we still need it to fulfil the
					purpose, for which it was originally provided (for example if we continue providing our services to you), if the processing is based on mandatory law (for example mandatory accounting regulations), or
					if we have a predominant interest of our own (for example in the case of a lawsuit against the data subject).</p>
				<p>If we assert a predominant interest in the processing of personal data, you have nevertheless the right to object to the processing; provided, however, that your individual situation compares
					differently to that of other data subjects (<span class="italic">right to object</span>). This could be the case, for example, if you are a person of public interest, or if processing increases the risk of you being
					harmed by
					third parties.</p>
				<p>If you disagree with our response to your request, you have the right to file a complaint with a competent supervisory authority, for example, in your country of (<span class="italic">right to appeal</span>).</p>

				<h3>13. Applicable Law and Place of Jurisdiction</h3>
				<p>This privacy policy and any agreements concluded based on, or in connection with, this privacy policy, as the case may be, are governed by <span class="bold">Swiss law</span>, unless the applicable law of another country
					is applies mandatorily. The place of jurisdiction is the <span class="bold">registered seat of OPG</span>, unless a different place of jurisdiction applies mandatorily.</p>
