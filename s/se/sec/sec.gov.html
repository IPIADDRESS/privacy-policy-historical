<h1>Your Privacy</h1>

<p> At various places on our web site, we tell you how to contact us, and we encourage you to give us some personal details about yourself. You do not have to give us personal information to visit our site. We collect personal information from you only if you choose to give it to us.</p>

<p> When we ask you to provide information to us voluntarily, the <a href="/cgi-bin/goodbye.cgi?www.usdoj.gov/foia/privstat.htm">Privacy Act of 1974</a> requires us to tell you how we can use the information. Under the Act, we cannot sanction you if you fail to provide all or any part of the information to us. Sanctions may apply if you provide information to us and you know it is false or misleading.</p>

<h2>A. Our Authority for Requesting Your Information</h2>

<p> The SEC is authorized to request information from you by various laws: Sections 19 and 20 of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 321 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, Section 42 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Section 209 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Section 202.5.</p>

<h2>B. The Principal Ways We May Use Your Information</h2>

<p> Our principal purpose for requesting information from you is to respond to inquiries and complaints from members of the public. The SEC may also use your information to determine whether any person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate the federal securities laws or rules that the SEC enforces, such as the rules of the securities exchanges and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. The SEC may use the information you provide in an enforcement proceeding. If the information points to violations of other laws or regulations, we may turn it over to other government agencies, including United States Attorneys and state prosecutors. We generally do not disclose to you whether we have done so or not.</p>

<p> The SEC will not agree to limit its use of your information in any way, unless the SEC or its staff explicitly agrees to do so in writing.</p>

<h2>C. Routine Uses of the Information You May Provide</h2>

</p><h2>D. False Statements and Documents</h2>
<p> Section 1001 of Title 18 of the United States Code provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The information you give the SEC may be used against you in any federal, state, local or foreign administrative, civil or criminal proceeding brought by the SEC or any other agency. You may refuse, in accordance with the rights guaranteed to you by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, to give any information that may tend to incriminate you or subject you to fine, penalty or forfeiture.</p>

<h2>E. The Freedom of Information Act</h2>

<p> The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) generally allows the SEC to make your information available to the public upon request. You may request that your information not be released to the public by writing a letter asking that it remain confidential under one of the exemptions described in FOIA (see 5 U.S.C. 552). The SEC determines whether your claim of an exemption is valid when someone requests your information under FOIA.</p>

<p> Rule 83 of the SEC's Rules on Information and Requests, (17 CFR 200.83) explains how you should make your request for confidentiality. Your letter may be sent or faxed to our FOIA Officer at 100 F Street, NE, MS 0-5, Washington, DC 20549 or fax number (703) 914-1149.  Alternatively, you may follow the instructions on our <a href="/foia.shtml">on-line FOIA pages</a>.</p>
