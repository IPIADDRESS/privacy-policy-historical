<h4 align="right" class="red">Last Update: 9/8/11</h4>

<p>
We are committed to advising you of the right to your privacy and strive to provide a safe and secure user experience.  This Privacy Policy sets forth the online data collection and usage policies and practices that apply to our website. 
</p>

<p>
By using our website, you explicitly accept, without limitation or qualification, the collection, use and transfer of the personally identifiable information <strong>("PII")</strong> and non-personally identifiable <strong>("Non-PII")</strong> information about you in the manner described in this policy.  Please read this Statement carefully as it affects your rights and liabilities under the law.  If you disagree or do not accept the way we collect and process your PII or Non-PII, please do not use this website.
</p>

<h2>SCOPE OF THIS POLICY</h2>

<p>
This policy applies to this website and regulates the processing of PII provided by you and Non-PII collected by us during your visit to our Website.  It describes what type of information we collect; how we use that information and to whom we can provide that information.  It also informs you of how to notify us to stop collecting and providing your information.  We are located in the United States and by registering on our website, you agree to be governed by the laws of the United States. 
</p>

<p>
Our Website may contain links to third party websites over which we have no control.  As such, we are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of third party websites, when you choose to link to them from our website.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of use of those third party websites to understand how they collect, use and share your information. 
</p>

<p>
We also do not control the data use practices of those persons or entities to whom we transfer your PII and Non-PII for the purposes of providing the service you have requested.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies and opt-out choices of those third parties so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.
</p>

<h2 align="left">INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND RETAIN</h2>

<p>
We collect the following general types of information about you when you register on our website and may collect combinations of these types of information:   
</p>

<p>
<i>Personally identifiable information <strong>(PII)</strong>:</i> is information that can be used to identify you.  We do not collect PII except when you choose to provide it to us.  Some examples of PII that we might collect from you during our interactions with you include: 
</p>

<li>Any other information you provide to us though the course of communicating with us about the products and services provided on our Website. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<i><u>Demographic information:</u></i> is information that may or may not be unique to you in the sense that it refers to selected population characteristics. Such information may include, but is not limited to, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests. 
</p>

<p>
<i><u>Behavioral information:</u></i> is information pertaining to how you use our website; the areas of our website that you visit; what ads or services you accessed; and information about your computer hardware and software including your IP address, geographic location, browser preference, operating system type, domain names, times that you access the internet and other website you have been referred to us through. This information is necessary to analyze the use of resources, troubleshooting problems, preventing fraud, and improving our services and products. 
</p>

<p>
<i><u>Third party information:</u></i> is information that we may acquire from a third party which may include personal, demographic, behavioral and indirect information.  We obtain this information so that we can personalize the advertising shown to you. 
</p>

<p>
<i><u>Web technology information:</u></i> is information we automatically collect from you when you open one of our emails or visit our Website.  This includes information collected from the use of cookies, web beacons or java script as discussed below.  
</p>

<p>
<i><u>No Information Collected from Children:</u></i>  We never knowingly collect any Personal Information about children under the age of 13.  If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected Personally Identifiable Information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database.  Because we do not collect such information, we have no information regarding its use or disclose to third parties. 
</p>

</p>

<h2 align="left">USE OF COOKIES, WEB BEACONS, AND JAVA SCRIPT</h2>

<p>
<i><u>Cookies:</u></i> "Cookies" are a feature in your browser software.  If enabled, we may write cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of our Website. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content or links you view or may have viewed on past visits.  When you visit our site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences.  We may use cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your past viewing history or the email or site that directed you to our Website.  You can disable cookies, although the website may not function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be modified to accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set.  You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use all of the features and functionality of our Website, you need to accept cookies.  
</p>

<p>
We predominately use "session" cookies, which are not permanently stored on your hard drive. Session cookies expire after two hours of inactivity or when you close your browser. When you carry out the purchase of a service or product on our website, a large amount of data is processed by our system and transferred through each page of the search or registration. This information includes all information you input on a registration page or questionnaire you complete as part of the registration process as well as demographic information that is not unique to you. "Session" cookies allow us to keep track of this data until you have completed your search or registration. 
</p>

<p>
<i><u>Removing Cookies:</u></i>  You have the ability to accept, decline or remove cookies at any time by modifying your browser settings. Please see http://cookiecentral.com. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on our website.
</p>

<p>
<i><u>Web Beacons:</u></i>  We also use electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs, clear gifs or action tags) that allow us to collect certain information about your visit to these Web pages (including the number of users who have visited those pages).  This measures and improves the effectiveness of advertisements and delivery of services. Web beacons are not used to access your PII; they are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about website usage.  Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of page view and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. This information may be shared with one or more third parties so that they can understand the types of visitors to our website; how those visitors use our website; and the effectiveness of advertisements. We may also use web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in our database.
</p>

<p>
<i><u>Disabling Web Beacons:</u></i>  Because web beacons are the same as any other content request, you cannot opt out or refuse them.  However, they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or changing the cookie setup in your browser.
</p>

<p>
<i><u>JavaScript:</u></i>  We may also use JavaScript within certain advertisements. JavaScript is a computer language that enhances the functionality of our website, particularly with respect to pictures.  We do not collect any PII through JavaScript but use it to analyze and improve our website's functions.
</p>

<p>
<i><u>Disabling JavaScript:</u></i>  You may deactivate JavaScript via your browser settings or activate it the same way.  If you disable JavaScript you will not be able to use some of the functions of our website.
</p>

<p>
<i><u>IP Addresses:</u></i>  Your Internet Protocol ("IP") is a unique Internet "address" which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by web servers and collect information about a user's traffic patterns.  While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the web. Your IP address can reveal what geographic area you are connecting from and which ISP you are using. We automatically track certain information based upon your actions on our website.  We may use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from and which URL you next go to after visiting our website, your computer browser information in addition to your IP address.
</p>

<p>
<i><u>Computer Profiles:</u></i>   We may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the experience of our visitors. For instance, we may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with PII, we are able to use such visitor data to identify you. 
</p>

<h2>SECURITY</h2>
<p>
We endeavor to safeguard and protect your information. When you submit information at the website, such information is protected both online and offline. The servers in which we store Personal Information are kept in a secure physical environment. We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. Currently, we use Secure Socket Layer Software ("SSL") to protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL encrypts information, including names and addresses as they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that, although we take commercially reasonable technological precautions to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot and do not warrant that your information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through this site is at your own risk. However, access to your information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public.
</p>

<h2>CHANGES TO PRIVACY STATEMENT</h2>
<p>
We reserve the right to make material changes to the substance of this Privacy Statement.  We will post those changes through a prominent notice on the web site so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and to whom we will disclose it.
</p>



<h2>YOUR CALIFORNIA RIGHTS</h2>
<p>
A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. </p>
<p>
However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.
</p>
<p>
As stated in this policy, you have agreed to allow us to share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes until you remove your information and thus, agreement for such disclosure. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide PII on our website or contact us via email to remove your information from our database. Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.
</p>
<p>
California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing support@secrettrafficsolution.com Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.
