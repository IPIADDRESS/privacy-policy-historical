<p>You can access any information we collect or you provide any time until your account has been deleted.</p>

<h3 class="ph3">How We Use Your Information</h3>

<p>The information we collect from you is used to improve our website, service, and any advertisements listed on our site. We may collect or use your information directly, or through a third party vendor, who will only use your information to perform services for us.</p>

<p>We may also use your information to:</p>

<p>We'll never share your personal information with others except through the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Third parties that are performing services on our behalf related to your account or use of this website. They will only have access to your information related to the service they are performing for us. They will not be able to share your personal information or use it for any reason other than the services they are contracted to perform for us.</li>

<h3 class="ph3">Interest-Based Online Advertising and Google Analytics</h3>

<p>This section of our Privacy Notice provides details about interest-based online advertising (also called "targeted advertising", “remarketing”, or "behavioral advertising"), Google Analytics, and your choices with respect to this type of advertising.</p>

<p>We use Google Analytics’ 3rd-party audience data such as age, gender and interests to better understanding the behavior of our customers and work with companies that collect information about your online activities to provide advertising targeted to suit your interests and preferences. For example, you may see certain ads on this website or other websites because we contract with Google and other similar companies to target our ads based on information we or they have collected, including information that was collected through automated means (such as cookies and web beacons). These companies also use automated technologies to collect information when you click on our ads, which helps track and manage the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.</p>

<p>You may opt out of the automated collection of information by third-party ad networks for the purpose of delivering advertisements tailored to your interests, by visiting the consumer opt-out page for the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> and edit or opt-out your Google Display Network ads’ preferences at <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/</a>. Because those opt-out and preference control pages are specific to the individual browser used to visit it, and because that page is not operated by Secret Benefits, we are unable to perform the opt-outs on your behalf.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, <a href="/contact_requests/new">please contact us here</a>.</p>
