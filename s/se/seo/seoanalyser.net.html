</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy covers PixTeller's treatment of personal information that PixTeller gathers when
you are on the PixTeller Website and when you use the "<strong>PixTeller services</strong>".
This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that PixTeller does not own or control,
or to individuals that PixTeller does not employ or manage.
</p>
<p>
Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your
information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your
choice is not to use our Website. By accessing or using this Website, you agree to this privacy
policy. This policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of this Website after we make
changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for
updates.
</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h3>Information collected by PixTeller</h3>
<p>
We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our Website, which is to
enable users to discover and share information with one another. This information allows us to
provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We do not process this information in a way
that is not compatible with this objective. We collect the following types of information from our
PixTeller users:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Information you provide:</strong> We are collecting and store any information you enter on
our Website in order to register and use our Service. We are also collecting and processing
information you share by contacting the Customer Support only for the purpose to fix any technical
or other issues in relation with the Service, to maintain and provide its functionality. You can
refuse to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to use certain service
or special features.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Registration information:</strong> When you register to PixTeller we ask you to provide
certain personal information, including a valid email address, location and username. We may collect
additional information such as physical address and additional authentication information, to
provide you with the services you need (such those that require payments), or to ensure the
marketplace integrity (for example, prevention of fraud). We collect information to provide better
services and enhanced user experience to all of our users. In addition, we collect information while
you access, browse, view or otherwise use the Website. In other words, when you access the Website
we are aware of your usage of the Website, and may gather, collect and record the information
relating to such usage, including geo-location information, IP address, device and connection
information, browser information and web-log information, and all communications recorded by Users
through the Website. We use that information to enhance user experience, personalize your browsing
experience as well as monitor the Website for fraud and inappropriate content or behavior. We may
also collect supplemental information obtained from third parties such as demographic and navigation
data. Once you register, your username and additional information regarding your activity that you
choose to make public on the Websitte will be visible to all Users of the Website. This information
includes photos you upload, your published portfolio, ratings, and additional information you may
choose to add to your profile as public. In case you choose to connect to PixTeller by using your
account information from other platforms such as Facebook, Google Plus, we are going to collect the

photos of yourself in your profile. These information is optional and you may choose not to share it
with us.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>Automatic Information:</strong> We receive and store certain types of information whenever
you interact with us. PixTeller and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain
"traffic data" on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, PixTeller cookies
information, and the page you requested. PixTeller uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems
with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Links:</strong> PixTeller may keep track of how you interact with links in posts across our
Services including third party services and clients by redirecting clicks or through other means. We
do this to help improve our Services, including advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click
statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on. This type of information is
anonymized and the scope is to improve the service.
</p>
