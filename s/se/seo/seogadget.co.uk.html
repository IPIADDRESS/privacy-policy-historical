This privacy notice supplements the other notices and is not intended to override them.</p><h3>Controller</h3><p>Builtvisible is the controller and responsible for your personal data (collectively referred to as “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our” in this privacy notice).</p><p>We have appointed a data privacy manager who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this privacy notice.

We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.</p><h3>Our company details</h3><p>Builtvisible.com is the trading name of Builtvisible Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales (no. 7016136) – VAT Registered: (no. 981 5863 76).</p><h3>Changes to the privacy notice and your duty to inform us of changes</h3><p>It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.</p><h3>Third party links</h3><p>Our website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website you visit.</p><h2>The data we collect about you</h2><p>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p><p>We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Identity Data</strong> includes [first name, maiden name, last name, username or similar identifier, marital status, title, date of birth and gender]</li><li><strong>Contact Data</strong> includes your [home address, business address, email address and telephone numbers]</li><li><strong>Professional Data</strong> includes [salary, job titles, previous roles, and professional experience and qualifications]</li><li><strong>Transaction Data</strong> includes [details about payments to and from you and other details of services you have purchased from us]</li><li><strong>Technical Data</strong> includes [internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access our website.]</li><li><strong>Usage Data</strong> includes [information about how you use our website and services]</li><li><strong>Marketing and Communications Data </strong>includes information that allows us to choose how best to market specific communications to you</li><li><strong>Special Categories of Personal Data</strong> where you provide this to us in the context of your instructions or in applying for a job (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data)</li></ul><p>We also collect, use and share <strong>Aggregated Data</strong> such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does <strong>not</strong> directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.</p><h3>If you fail to provide personal data</h3><p>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you or your employer and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into (for example, to provide the goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel services but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p><h2>How is your personal data collected?</h2><p>We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:</p><p><strong>Direct interactions.</strong> You may give us your data through our provision of services or goods to you, your employer or the organisation you represent, during the course of dealings with you for or on behalf of a client, and by filling in forms or by corresponding with us [website, post, phone, email or otherwise]. This includes personal data you provide when you:</p><ul><li>apply for or use our goods and/ or services;</li><li>subscribe to our service or publications;</li><li>request marketing to be sent to you; or</li><li>give us some feedback.</li></ul><p><strong>Automated technologies or interactions.</strong> As you interact with our website, we may automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns.</p><p><strong>Third parties or publicly available sources.</strong> We may receive personal data about you from various third parties and public sources as set out below:</p><ul><li>Technical Data from analytics providers such as Google based outside the EU.</li><li>Identity and Contact Data from publicly available sources such as the internet, Experian, Companies House and the Electoral Register based inside the EU</li></ul><h2>How we use your personal data</h2><p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p><ul><li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li><li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li><li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li><li>To carry out services we have agreed to provide to you.</li></ul><p>You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.</p><h3>Purposes for which we will use your personal data</h3><p>We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate.</p><p>Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data where more than one ground has been set out in the table below.</p><table width="677"><tbody><tr><td width="205"><strong>Purpose/ Activity</strong></td><td width="205"><strong>Type of data</strong></td><td width="205"><strong>Lawful basis for processing including legitimate interest to do so</strong></td></tr><tr><td width="205">To register you as a new client</td><td width="205">Identity, contact</td><td width="205">Performance of a contract</td></tr><tr><td width="205">To manage payments, fees and charges and collect any fees owed to us</td><td width="205">Identity, contact, financial, information, marketing and communications</td><td width="205">Performance of a contract, our legitimate interests to recover and process debts due to us</td></tr><tr><td width="205">To provide services and manage our relationship with you including using a third party to assist in the provision of the services.

We have established the following personal data control mechanisms:</p><p><strong>Promotional offers from us </strong></p><p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, and Usage Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).</p><p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have purchased services from us previously and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing or if you have signed up to our Inner Circle newsletter.</p><p><strong>Opting out</strong></p><p>You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time.</p><p>Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a service purchase or other transactions.</p><p><strong>Change of purpose </strong></p><p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected&nbsp;it,&nbsp;unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.</p><p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p><p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p><h2>Disclosures of your personal data</h2><p>We may have to share your personal data with the third parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table above.</p><ul><li>Service providers acting as processors based in the UK who provide services to us, including but not limited to, IT.</li><li>Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers who provide services to us.</li><li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers based in the United Kingdom who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.</li><li>Third party service providers who provide services that involve data processing, translation, technology, research, banking and payment, client contact, data entry and processing, litigation support, marketing and security services and other similar services.</li><li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.</li></ul><p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p><h2><strong>International transfers</strong></h2><p>Some of our external third parties may be based or may send personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data may involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p><p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p><ul><li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</li><li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between&nbsp;Europe&nbsp;and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</li><li>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</li></ul><h2>Data Security</h2><p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p><p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p><h2>Data Retention</h2><p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p><p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p><p>By law we have to keep basic information about our clients (including Contact, Identity, and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being clients for regulatory purposes.</p><p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see <strong>Request erasure</strong> below for further information.</p><p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p><h2>Your legal rights</h2><p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.&nbsp;You have the right to:</p><p><strong>Request access </strong>to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p><p><strong>Request correction </strong>of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p><p><strong>Request erasure </strong>of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p><p><strong>Object to processing </strong>of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p><p><strong>Request restriction of processing </strong>of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p><p><strong>Request the transfer </strong>of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p><p><strong>Withdraw consent at any time </strong>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p><p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.</p><h3>No fee usually required</h3><p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p><h3>What we may need from you</h3><p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p><h3>Time limit to respond</h3><p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.
