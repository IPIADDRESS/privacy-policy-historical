			<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sevelina Games respects the privacy rights of our online visitors and mobile customers and recognises the importance of protecting the information collected about you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Children’s privacy: personal information is not collected from children.</b>&nbsp; Currently, Sevelina Games does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we were to collect and store personal information from children, we would obtain the consent of a parent or legal guardian before such collection.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This Privacy Policy applies to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Sevelina Games and its affiliates through the sevelina.com and sevelina.ru websites, and through Sevelina Games mobile apps. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information through any apps for which Sevelina Games is not the publisher.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What is personal information and what personal information does Sevelina Games</b> <b>collect?&nbsp;</b></span><span class="s1">Sevelina.com does not collect any personal information.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Statistical and Usage Data</i></span><span class="s1">: When you play our games on your mobile device, we may retrieve information about your hardware system and how your game is used, including your Internet Protocol Address or device identifier. We may also collect information about your computer, hardware, software, platform, media, address and connection, information about online activity such as feature usage, game play statistics and scores, user rankings, click paths, and in-app purchases. We use this information to enable you to play your game over the Internet. We also use this information to better understand the behaviour and preferences of our customers, so that we can improve our products and services.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Other Uses</i></span><span class="s1"><i>: </i>We may also use your information for other purposes, with your consent. Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected and our legitimate business objectives or as permitted or required by law.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Use of “Cookies”</i></span><span class="s1">:&nbsp; Our website may use cookies to enhance your experience while using our website. Cookies are pieces of information that some websites transfer to the computer that is browsing that website and are used for record-keeping purposes at many websites. Use of cookies makes Web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving language preferences and maintaining your sessions while you are on our website. The cookies used on our website contain generic information used for page navigation. If you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, some areas of our website may not function properly.&nbsp; We also use cookies related to the use of Google Analytics on our website. Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to report on visitor interactions.<b> </b>These cookies are used to collect information about how visitors use our site. We use the information to compile reports and to help us improve the site. You can opt out of tracking by Google Analytics by visiting: </span><span class="s3"><b>http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB</b></span><span class="s1">.&nbsp; In any event, we do not link information collected through cookies with any personally identifiable information.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Internet Protocol Address</i></span><span class="s1">: We collect an IP address from every visitor to our website. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our website, analyse trends, track users’ movement on our website, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the website, and deliver customised, personalised content. We do not link IP addresses with any personally identifiable information.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>In-Game Advertising</i></span><span class="s1">: Our games may incorporate dynamic advertisement serving technology offered by our Advertising Network Providers (<b>AdProviders</b>), which enables advertising to be temporarily uploaded into the game and replaced while you play. Logged data may include Internet Protocol Address or players’ user name, in game location, length of time an advertisement was visible, size of the advertisements, and angle of view. Your game may be assigned an ID number, which is stored on your device, and used by Ad Providers to calculate the number of unique and repeat views of dynamic in-game advertising. The ID number is not associated with any personal data and for children-directed games is not used for behavioral advertising purposes. No logged information is used to personally identify you. The servers used by the Ad Providers may be located outside your country of residence. This ad serving technology is integrated into the game; if you do not want to use this technology, do not play the game while connected to the Internet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Public Data</i></span><span class="s1">: Your participation in online game events is conditional upon you agreeing to us collecting, using, storing, transmitting and publicly displaying non-identifiable statistical data (such as your scores, rankings and achievements) generated through your participation.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Third Parties</i></span><span class="s1">:<b> </b>You may register for other services from our website(s). If you opt in to any of these services, we may collect additional information requested by a third party and pass this information, together with all other registration information (including personal information), to that third party.

Participation in these other related services is optional and is not required to play Sevelina games, or participate in any of our other websites.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Marketing</i></span><span class="s1">:<b> </b>The personal information you provide will allow us to alert you to new products, features and enhancements; special offers; upgrade opportunities; and contests and events of interest. From time to time, we are approached by companies and organisations that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and we may provide your personal information (except that of children under 13 years old) to such third parties.
