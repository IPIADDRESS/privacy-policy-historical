</li>
<li>
<p>Information concerning a user that the website collects online from the user, and maintains in personally identifiable form, in combination with an identifier described in this privacy policy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4>Other information</h4>
<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information may include:</p>
<p>
<u>Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data:</u>
</p>
<p>We may use this information in the administration of this site, diagnose problems with our server, to improve site usability, to analyze trends, to track users' movement around the site, and to gather Demographic Information (definition below) about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p>
<u>Click-through URL:</u>
</p>
<p>In some of our email messages we use a click-through URL linked to content on our site.  When visitors click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page.  We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our communications.  If you prefer to avoid this type of tracking; avoid clicking text or graphic links on the site or in site related emails.</p>
<p>
<u>Pixel tags:</u>
</p>

<p>Submission of your Personally Identifiable Information and accessing our sites provides you with a wealth of information including discussions, ratings and reviews, and blog postings.  In most cases, this information is retained and used, for instance, so you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list.  When you update your community membership information, a backup copy of the prior version is kept for a reasonable period of time to enable revision to the prior version of that information should the need arise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we provide you with a variety of options for you to take control of your health by providing you with promotions and offers through our partnerships. When you "opt-in" to one of our partner advertising offers and you provide your Personally Identifiable Information to receive an advertising offer within or hosted on our site we are committed to providing the information you submitted to our advertising partners.</p>
<p>When you make such request, you provide consent for us to disclose (share, sell, rent or trade) your Personally Identifiable Information, such as your name, address, phone or address, to said third party who may then use your Personally Identifiable Information to contact you; and provide you the information, materials, products or services you requested.</p>
<p>In such specific cases, you may also specifically grant Alliance Health and said third party permission to contact you by telephone, mail and/or email, including phone calls that may use computer assisted technology and/or pre-recorded messages.</p>
<p>Occasionally we may utilize this information ourselves in an aggregate basis to understand your preferences or disclose this same information in aggregate with our sponsors and advertising partners to provide better service to you.</p>
<p>We respect your privacy in the utmost and commit never to pursue the following activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Disclose your private online communications; however, information you choose to post in public forums or comments on our sites is open to the general public and search engines. We do however provide the ability for you to de-identify your conversations through tools that we provide like anonymous Connect posting or offer privacy solutions featured in the user profile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share, rent, or sell or trade your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties except where you have positively and explicitly "opted-in", to an offer within or hosted on our site requesting information, materials, products or services from a third party, such as our advertising partners.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In certain circumstances we may share Personally Identifiable Information for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We may employ other companies and individuals, as our subcontractors, to perform functions on our behalf.  These companies and individuals may not share any Personally Identifiable Information with any third party. All such subcontractors are contractually obligated to use and maintain the confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authentication and verification of Personally Identifiable Information to prevent fraud on our platform.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>This same disclosure policy also applies to those cases where we believe an individual may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights or property of Alliance Health, other site users, of anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disclose or access Personally Identifiable Information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, and for administrative and other purposes deemed necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>

<h2 id="partners">Our Advertising Partners and Our Relationships to Other Companies</h2>
<p>In our effort to empower consumers and help enable a more consumer-centric healthcare industry, we are committed to providing a free and independent service. As a result our site may contain information, links to other sites and advertisements of healthcare services and partners that may help you make educated healthcare choices. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such websites but encourage you to evaluate their specific commitment to you.</p>
<p>Certain products and services marketed through the site are made available by the trusted partner companies of Alliance Health with which we have a strategic alliance. To obtain these products and services you may be required to visit another company's website or a site they share with the site. When ordering, registering for, or purchasing products or services from these partners, you will be entering into an agreement with that partner, and not with Alliance Health. In these cases, this privacy policy does not apply; instead, the privacy policy of the partner providing the goods or services will apply.</p>
<p>We urge you to read and understand our partners' policies before entering into agreements with them. We are committed to partnering with companies that share our privacy concerns. Alliance Health, however, cannot control the way these partners collect or use information.</p>
<p>If you have questions about our partners' privacy policies or the privacy policies of these other sites, we encourage you to contact them directly.</p>
<p>All Alliance Health offers are subject to participation by the advertising partner, product availability, and any applicable state or federal laws that govern such offers. Any offers shown are reasonable facsimiles, and participating advertising partners reserve the right to withdraw offers, substitute another product, or modify offers at their sole discretion.</p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>We use secure technology, privacy protection controls, and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We use a secure, respected hosting provider for all of our sites, which are housed in a SAS 70 TYPE II certified data center.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also use firewalls and other access controls on our servers that are monitored to help protect against security vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Personally Identifiable Information is entered or displayed on registration forms and pages, we encrypt that information.  We exclusively use 2048 bit SSL certificates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each and every one of our employees servicing our sites are obligated to abide by the Privacy Policy.  Only authorized employees servicing our sites are permitted to have access to your Personally Identifiable Information, and such access is limited by need.</p>
<p>Since the internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Alliance Health.  There is no guarantee that the information may not be accessed, copied, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
<p>
Any improper collection or misuse by unauthorized third parties of Personally Identifiable Information, or other information provided on the site is a violation of the terms of use and should be reported to <a href="mailto:community@alliancehealth.com">community@alliancehealth.com</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="changes">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time, so please review them frequently.</p>
<p>If we make material changes to either our Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use, we will notify you here, or by email, or by means of a notice on our home page prior to the change becoming effective.</p>

If we become aware that a child has circumvented this policy we immediately terminate the related account and delete all information/date associated with the account.</p>
