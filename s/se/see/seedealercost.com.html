	<br>
	Use of Cookies, GIF Files, and other Technology.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Cookies</strong>. Cookies are pieces of information that some websites transfer to the computer that is browsing that website ("Cookies"), and are used for record-keeping purposes at many websites. The use of Cookies makes web surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving your passwords, background information, and your personal preferences regarding your use of the particular website. Many consider the use of Cookies to be an industry standard. Your browser is probably set to accept Cookies; however, it may be set to block acceptance of cookies, erase Cookies from your computer hard drive, or receive a warning before a Cookie is stored. If you would prefer not to receive Cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse, erase, or to warn you of the use of Cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse Cookies, it is possible that some areas of our Site and Services that uses Cookies will not function properly when you view it and your online experience will be limited.<br>
	<br>
	SeeDealerCost™ uses Cookies to administer the Site and Services and not to track surfing habits. Our Services collect Personal Information under the following situations: (1) to the extent that you provide Information to us in an email message, your profile, or a price quote request; (2) to the extent that your web browser provides Information to our web server, like the site you linked from, the identity of your internet service provider, or the type of browser you are using; and (3) to the extent that you provide Personal Information to us in a CGI form (for example, when you subscribe to our newsletter).<br>
	<br>
	<strong>GIF Files</strong>. SeeDealerCost™ uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files may be provided by our ad management partner and enable it to recognize a unique Cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our Site. The Cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with our ad management partner. With both Cookies and spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is Anonymous Information, which may be shared in aggregate form, and it is not personally identifiable and therefore does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.<br>
	<br>
	SeeDealerCost™ uses certain third party web analytics software in order to monitor the use of its Website.&nbsp; If you have concerns, or need assistance, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@seedealercost.com?subject=Analytics">support@SeeDealerCost.com</a>.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Partnership, Advertising and Links</strong>.&nbsp; Please be aware that SeeDealerCost™ may occasionally link to other sites for promotional or advertising purposes. These sites are independent of SeeDealer. As such, we encourage you to refer to each site's terms of use and privacy policy for their use of Cookies and Personal Information. In addition, if a company product is highlighted within a promotion, such company may have additional terms and conditions associated with this product. Please refer to the company's terms of use and privacy policy for their use of Personal Information.<br>
