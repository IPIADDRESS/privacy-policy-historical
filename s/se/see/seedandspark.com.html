	Information Shared with Third Parties.</h3>
<p>Generally, Seed&amp;Spark will not provide your Personal Information to any third parties except as reasonably necessary in the performance of the Services or otherwise in order to operate our business.

We use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such third parties from using or disclosing your Personal Information for any reason other than the service they are providing in connection with the Services. We may provide your name, mailing address and/or email address in certain limited circumstances in connection with the Services, such as to a Project Owner if you choose to loan items, follow, or apply as Cast or Crew for a Project.

Additionally, we may disclose your Personal Information in the case of an emergency or as required or permitted by law, or to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of a third party. For example, if a third party alleges that you have infringed their intellectual property rights, we may disclose your Personal Information as it relates to such allegations. We may also provide your Personal Information to other companies or organizations for credit fraud protection and risk reduction.</p>
<p>Seed&amp;Spark may use certain information about you and/or your User Submissions without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing advertisements and promotions.
