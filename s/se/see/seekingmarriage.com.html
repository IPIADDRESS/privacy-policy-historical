		number; information about your interests in and use of various products,
		programs, and services; and education level and interests. Although we are not collecting credit card
		information at this time, we reserve the right to do so in the future. <span style="color:black">To the extent that customer credit
		card-specific information is collected by </span>
		Seeking Marriage		<span style="color:black"> and
		any of its affiliates and/or subsidiaries, said information will be kept in
		confidence and will not be shared with any third parties (other than consumer

		the fact that they have credit card information on file for specific customers
		but they will not share this credit card information with third parties without
		the customer's prior informed consent.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText">Like most standard website servers, we use log files. Log files track anonymous user information
		including, but not limited to, Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, browser
		type, Internet Service Provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, platform type,
		date/time stamp, and number of clicks. This information is tracked in order to analyze trends, administer the
		Website, track users' movements in the aggregate and gather broad demographic
		information for aggregate use. The
		information tracked via log files is not linked to personally identifiable
	information.</p>
	<h1>Cookies:</h1>
	<p class="MsoBodyText">The Website uses a “cookie” to assign a unique identifier
		to your computer. The cookies we use are
		persistent files that your web browser places on your computer's hard
		drive. Cookies may be used to help save
		information on past activities and other preferences, so that you are not
		required to reenter information each time that you visit the Website, and to
	deliver content specific to your interests. No personally identifiable information is gathered by the cookie.</p>

		maintain separate email lists for different purposes. In order to end your email subscription to a
		particular list, you must follow the instructions contained in any email
		correspondence that you receive from

		automatically unsubscribe you from all email lists. We only send email marketing to individuals
		that have agreed, whether by visiting this Website or through third party
		websites, to receive email marketing from

		email. As a result, certain statutes,

	<p class="MsoBodyText">Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we
		may be required to disclose personal information in some instances, such as: 1)
		when required by law wherein we have a good faith belief that such action is
		necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, and/or subpoena;
		2) in the event that
		Seeking Marriage		is sold or acquired; or 3) in the event
		that we believe that the Website is being, or has been, used in violation of
