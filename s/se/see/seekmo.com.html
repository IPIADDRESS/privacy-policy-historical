<p style="text-align:left">At Zango, Inc., we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to any website (“Website”) that references this Policy and is provided by Zango or its affiliates (“we” or “Zango”), and to those Zango-owned software products made available to you from a Website (“Software”) (please see below for important information on third party software products made available from the Websites). This Privacy Policy governs information you provide to us or that we learn from you by your use of our Websites and Software, and tells you how we may collect, use, and in some instances, share this information. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>What We Collect and Use </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Cookies.</strong> By accessing any Website, Zango may place cookies on your hard drive. Zango uses cookies to enable you to sign in to certain services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server. Some cookies are used only to assist you with your session on a Website – such cookies expire automatically after you terminate your session. Zango also uses cookies to improve the sign-in experience on certain Websites. For example, your user ID may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you terminate your session. This cookie allows your user ID to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. Finally, Zango may place a cookie on your hard disk on behalf of a sponsor when such sponsor’s web page is shown, so that the sponsor can measure the effectiveness of such web page. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies can only be accessed or read by the domain that placed them. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use certain features of a Website that depend on cookies. </p>
