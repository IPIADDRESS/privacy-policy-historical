								<div>Seekmo is a service of 180solutions. At 180, we are committed to protecting your privacy. The following privacy policy encompasses all of our businesses including the Seekmo website. </div><br>
								<div>180solutions, Inc. and its affiliates (referred to in this privacy policy as "we" or "180") are committed to your privacy.  This Privacy Policy is designed to explain how 180 collects and uses information, and covers your use of the entire network of 180's Websites, including Zango.com, ZangoCash.com, Seekmo.com, MetricsDirect.com, 180searchAssistant.com, and 180solutions.com (the "180 Websites") and all software licensed to you by 180 (the "180 Software"), including 180search Assistant, Seekmo Search Assistant, Zango Search Assistant, and Search Toolbar products (collectively, the "Search Assistant Software").  We do not collect, store or use personally identifiable information about you unless you specifically opt to provide us with such information as provided below.</div><br>
								<div><b>What We Collect and Use</b><br>
								<div><b>180 Websites.</b> By accessing any of the 180 Websites, 180 may place cookies on your hard drive.  180 uses cookies to enable you to sign in to certain services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web Server.  Some cookies are used only to assist you with your session on 180 Websites â€“ such cookies expire automatically after you terminate your session.  180 also uses cookies to improve the sign-in experience on certain 180 Websites. For example, your user ID may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you terminate your session. This cookie allows your user ID to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in.  Finally, 180 may place a cookie on your hard disk on behalf of a sponsor when such sponsorâ€™s web page is shown, so that the sponsor can measure the effectiveness of such web page. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.  Cookies can only be accessed or read by the domain that placed them.  You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use certain features of 180 Websites that depend on cookies.<br><br>

								<div><b>IP Addresses.</b> Your use of the 180 Software or the 180 Website will involve the transmission of your Internet protocol address ("IP Address") to 180's servers.

								<div><b>Control of your Personal Information.</b> 180 offers you choices for the collection, use and sharing of your personal information.
