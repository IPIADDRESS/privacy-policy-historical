        <h2>How do we protect your information?</h2>
        <p>The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet,
            or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
            protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        <p>Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of
            persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information
            confidential. In addition, all sensitive information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
            technology.</p>
        <p>We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards. An external PCI compliant payment
            gateway handles all CC transactions. We use regular Malware Scanning.</p>
        <p>We implement a variety of security measures when a user places an order enters, submits, or accesses their
            information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p>
        <p>All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.</p>

        <p>
            You may be aware that the new European Union legislation - the General Data Protection Regulation or "GDPR" - confers certain rights on individuals with respect to their personal data. We have therefore implemented more transparency to help users take advantage of those same rights. We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. As provided in terms of applicable law and unless limited by it, the rights granted to individuals are as follows:
            </p><ul style="list-style: disc; color: inherit; margin-left: 3rem;">
                <li><b>Right of access</b> - the right to be informed and request access to the personal data we process about the User;</li>
                <li><b>Right of rectification</b>- the right to request that we change or update the User's personal data whenever they are incorrect or incomplete;</li>
                <li><b>Right to delete information</b>- the right to request us to erase your personal data;</li>
                <li><b>Right to restrict</b>- the right to request that we temporarily or permanently interrupt the processing of all or some of your personal data;</li>
                <li><b>Right to portability of data</b>- the right to request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit such personal data for use in third party services; and</li>
                <li><b>Right not to be subject to automated decisions</b> - the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on an automated decision, including profiling, where the decision may have a legal effect for itself or have an equally significant effect.</li>
            </ul>
