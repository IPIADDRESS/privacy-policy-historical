<b>NOTICE:  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee.htm">Click here</a> for important information about safe surfing from the Federal Trade Commission. </b></p><p>

<b>What This Privacy Policy Covers</b><br>
</p><ul>
<li>This policy covers how SeeqPod treats personal information that SeeqPod collects and receives, including information related to your past use of SeeqPod products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. 
</li><li>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that SeeqPod does not own or control, or to people that SeeqPod does not employ or manage.  


</li></ul>

<b> Information Collection and Use</b><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>General </b><br>
</p><ul>
<li>SeeqPod collects personal information when you register with SeeqPod, when you use SeeqPod products or services, when you visit SeeqPod pages or the pages of certain SeeqPod partners, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes.  SeeqPod may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. 
</li><li>When you register we may ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. For some financial products and services we may also ask for your address, Social Security number, and information about your assets. Once you register with SeeqPod and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.
</li><li>SeeqPod collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of financial products and services that we offer.
</li><li>SeeqPod automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, SeeqPod cookie information, and the page you request. 

</li><li>SeeqPod uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.  
</li></ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Children</b><br>
<ul>
<li>When a child under age 13 attempts to register with SeeqPod, we ask that he or she have a parent or guardian create a SeeqPod Family Account to obtain parental permission. 
</li><li>SeeqPod will not contact children under age 13 about special offers or for marketing purposes without a parent's permission. 
</li><li>SeeqPod does not ask a child under age 13 for more personal information, as a condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate in a given activity or promotion.
</li></ul>

<b> Information Sharing and Disclosure</b><br>

<ul>
<li>SeeqPod does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with SeeqPod under confidentiality agreements.  These companies may use your personal information to help SeeqPod communicate with you about offers from SeeqPod and our marketing partners.  However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
</li><li>We have a parent's permission to share the information if the user is a child under age 13. Parents have the option of allowing SeeqPod to collect and use their child's information without consenting to SeeqPod sharing of this information with people and companies who may use this information for their own purposes;  
</li><li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; 
</li><li>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of SeeqPod's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
</li><li>We transfer information about you if SeeqPod is acquired by or merged with another company.  In this event, SeeqPod will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
</li></ul>
</li><li>SeeqPod displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria  - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.
<ul>
<li>SeeqPod does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad.  However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. 
</li><li>SeeqPod advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies). 
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<b> Cookies</b><br>
<ul>
<li>SeeqPod may set and access SeeqPod cookies on your computer. 
</li><li>SeeqPod lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to SeeqPod's cookies.
