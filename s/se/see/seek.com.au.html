    <h1>
        SEEK's Privacy Statement</h1>
    <h2>
        SEEK's commitment to maintaining your privacy</h2>
    <p>
        SEEK's Privacy Statement has been created because we value our users and recognise
        their right to keep personal information private. This statement discloses our information
        gathering and dissemination practices for all sites managed by SEEK.</p>
    <h2>
        Collecting information on SEEK visitors</h2>
    <p>
        SEEK collects information on our site visitors collectively including which sections
        of the site are most frequently visited, how often and for how long. This data is
        always used as aggregated, non-personal information. SEEK utilises this information
        to improve and enhance our services by monitoring the areas on the site which are
        most popular to you. This aggregated information may be shared with SEEK partners
        to provide them with an overview of how SEEK visitors use the site. This is done
        for the purposes of providing you with the best online career management services.
    </p>
    <h3>
        IP Addresses</h3>
    <p>
        SEEK's web servers gather your IP address to assist with the diagnosis of problems
        or support issues with our services, and to monitor legitimate use of our site.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Cookies &amp; Applets</h3>
    <p>
        SEEK uses cookies to provide you with a better experience. These cookies and applets
        allow you to use specific services such as Job Mail (an alert service which emails
        your chosen jobs), Application Tracker (to manage your SEEK job applications), to
        remember who you are for Auto Login if you choose this option and to remember your
        last search criteria for My Last Search.
    </p>
    <p>Users who do not wish to have cookies active whilst they browse the Site can "opt out"  
        by following the instructions on this <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin/browsers.html" target="_blank">page</a>. However, doing so will prevent access to some areas
         of the Site and limit your use of some of the SEEK services.</p> 


    <h3>
        Third Party Measurement</h3>
    <p>
        In order to better understand our users, SEEK utilises a third party measurement
        company, <a href="http://www.nielsen-netratings.com" target="_blank">Nielsen//NetRatings</a>
        to assess site traffic. A tracking code is used to collect the following information
        on the usage of the SEEK site:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The number of page views (or page impressions) that occur on SEEK;</li>
        <li>The number of unique visitors to SEEK;</li>
        <li>How long these unique visitors (on average) spend on SEEK when they do visit; and</li>
        <li>Common entry and exit points into SEEK.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This aggregate, non-personal information is collated and provided to SEEK to assist
        in analysing the usage of the site. This data is also accessible by media organisations
        and research companies, for the purpose of conducting industry comparisons with
        other Internet websites.</p>
    <h2>
        Collecting information on SEEK Registered '<a href="/MyAccount">My Account</a>'
        Members
    </h2>
    <p>
        As part of registering with SEEK, we collect personal information about you in order
        for you to take full advantage of SEEK's services. To do this it may be necessary
        for you to provide additional information to SEEK as detailed below.</p>
    <h3>
        Registration</h3>
    <p>
        Registration is completely optional. However, registration for '<a href="/MyAccount">My Account</a>'
        services allows you to take advantage of more of the tools and resources that assist
        you in finding a job. Registration includes submitting your email address. You may
        access this information at any time by clicking 'My Details' on '<a href="/MyAccount">My Account</a>',
        or by clicking here.</p>
    <h3>
        Job Mail</h3>
    <p>
        Job Mail is an optional service. SEEK requests that you provide information relating
        to your employment preferences as well as your email address so that we may notify
        you via email of jobs specific to your needs. Users can modify or delete their Job
        Mail profiles at any time by going to the '<a href="/MyAccount">My Account</a>'
        area of the site.</p>
    <h3>
        Storing your resume</h3>
    <p>
        SEEK registered members may elect to store up to 10 resumes in their 'My Account'
        area, and use those resumes when applying for a job. Deleting a resume from My Account
        will mean it is no longer accessible to the registered member. Please note that
        deleted records may still be stored by SEEK in testing or backup systems for a period
        of time.</p>
    <h3>
        SEEK Profile</h3>
    <p>
        SEEK provides registered members with the option of creating a personal profile.
        A profile includes your resume, employment and educational history, contact details,
        minimum salary expectation and the classifications and locations ('Profile') registered
        members would like to work in. Registered members' profiles can be seen by SEEK clients who place job ads 
        in matching classifications and locations. Members can of course choose to hide their profile at any time. 
        Registered members' Profiles will remain&nbsp; anonymous until
        the SEEK client purchases access to a registered members resume and contact details.
        SEEK provides registered members with the following privacy options in relation
        to the access allowed to their Profile:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Provide resume and contact details immediately</strong>
            <p>
                When a SEEK client purchases a registered member’s Profile that resume and
                the contact details in that resume will be emailed immediately to the relevant SEEK
                client.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Check with me before providing my resume and contact details </strong>
            <p>
                When a SEEK client purchases a Profile, SEEK will send the relevant registered member
                an email with the job advertisement the SEEK client is considering the registered
                member for, and that registered member can decide whether to release their resume
                and contact details to that client or not.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Hide or delete Profile</strong>
            <p>
                Registered members can elect to hide their Profile, so SEEK clients cannot see Private
                Profile at all, whilst allowing the Profile to be stored in the My Account area
                of the site. Alternatively Registered Members can elect to delete their Profile.
                Deleting a Profile from the My Account area of the site will mean it is no longer
                accessible to the registered member. Please note that deleted Profiles may still
                be stored by SEEK in testing or backup systems for a period of time.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All information provided when creating a Profile including name, resume, email address,
        telephone numbers, employment and educational history are used for the purposes
        of facilitating registered members job seeking efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Registered Members can modify, hide or delete their resume at any time by going
        to the '<a href="/MyAccount">My Account</a>'
        area of the site.</p>
    <p>
        SEEK reserves the right to disable or delete a Profile at their sole discretion.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Online Applications</h3>
    <p>
        Making an online application to a job advertisement on SEEK is a free and optional
        service that does not require registration. Job applications require you to complete
        mandatory fields (first name, last name, phone and email) so that the advertiser
        can identify and contact you. Your application, including attachments and cover
        letters, are forwarded directly on to the third party advertiser and Registered
        users have the option of saving their resumes and cover letters. This information
        may also be disclosed to SEEK's service providers and contractors from time to time
        who assist us to deliver our products and services.
    </p>
    <p>
        SEEK may also retain this information in order to customise the service we provide
        to you. For example, SEEK may use this information to help create a SEEK Profile
        that you may choose to use in the future. We will not however activate this (or
        any other service) or disclose this information to any third party without your
        express consent. SEEK does however reserve the right to disable or delete a saved
        resume or cover letter at its discretion.</p>
    <p>
        By applying to a position advertised on SEEK you are requesting that SEEK pass the
        information to the Advertiser as a part of your application.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, you have the right to request your personal information direct from
        Advertisers on SEEK.</p>
    <h2>
        Email communications from SEEK</h2>
    <p>
        SEEK also provides you with selected information about job seeking and career-related
        topics in our email newsletter SEEK News Update. This free service is sent to registered
        users and provides the option of opting out of receiving these by changing your
        preferences in 'My Account'. SEEK may also make you aware of additional products
        and services which form part of your relationship with SEEK.</p>
    <h2>
        Storage &amp; Security of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        SEEK takes all reasonable steps to ensure the security of our system. SEEK allows
        you to access your information at any time to keep it accurate and up to date. Any
        information which we hold for you is stored on secure servers that are protected
        in controlled facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, our employees and the contractors who provide services related to our
        information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information
        held by SEEK. However, SEEK will not be held responsible for events arising from
        unauthorised access of your personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also play an important role in keeping your personal information secure,
        by maintaining the confidentiality of any password and accounts used on the SEEK
        site. Please <a href="mailto:userhelp@seek.com.au">notify us immediately</a>
        if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other Internet user or any
        other breach of security.</p>
    <h2>
        Access to Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        As indicated in point 2, unless you become a registered '<a href="/MyAccount">My Account</a>'
        user, SEEK does not collect information that identifies you personally. If however,
        you become a SEEK registered user, you are able to change, update or delete your
        registered profile at any time by logging in to
        <a href="/MyAccount">My Account</a>.
        You can also request your personal information directly from Advertisers who you
        have applied to on the site.</p>
    <h2>
        SEEK Partners &amp; Advertisers</h2>
    <p>
        SEEK provides links and passes online application to third party sites. The use
        of your information by these third party sites is not within the control of SEEK
        and we cannot accept responsibility for the conduct of these companies.
        <br>
        <br>
        With the consent of SEEK's registered members, SEEK may provide that member's personal 
        profile to SEEK clients who have placed job ads with matching classifications and
        locations to the registered member's profile and who have purchased access to the
        member's profile.. The use of that information by these SEEK clients is not within
        the control of SEEK and we cannot accept responsibility for the conduct of these
        clients.
        <br>
        <br>
        SEEK clients who place job ads on SEEK, and who purchase SEEK registered members'
        profiles are asked to comply with Australian federal privacy policy with regard
        to their own information handling practices.</p>
    <p>
        You may also directly contact advertisers to request access to any personal information
        that you have sent as part of an application or as part of a profile.</p>
    <h2>
        Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes, we transfer information to 3rd party contractors including persons outside
        Australia (e.g. a contractor located in the USA who provides us with services).
        By giving us your personal information, you consent to such disclosures. In addition,
        where we transfer information to persons outside Australia we believe that the recipients
        of such information are subject to a law, binding scheme or contract which effectively
        upholds principles for fair handling of the information that are substantially similar
        to the National Privacy Principles.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Feedback</h2>
    <p>
        SEEK welcomes ideas and feedback about all aspects of the site. SEEK stores feedback
        that users send to us. This feedback will be used to administer and refine the service
        and may be shared with SEEK partners either in aggregate form or with specific identifying
        characteristics removed.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Privacy &amp; Site Changes</h2>
    <p>
        From time to time, SEEK may review and update its privacy statement. Revised versions
        will be updated on the website.</p>
    <h2>
