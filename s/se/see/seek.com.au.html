<div class="grid_12 mod-section grid_pad_32">
    <h2>SEEK's commitment to maintaining your privacy</h2>
    <p>
        SEEK's Privacy Statement has been created because we value our users and recognise their right to keep personal information private.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Privacy Statement applies to any personal information you disclose to SEEK through your use of any products on the Site (as defined below), including but not limited to, becoming a registered user, creating a SEEK Profile and submitting job applications.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="grid_12 mod-section grid_pad_32">
    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <p>
        Where used in this Statement, the terms ‚Äúpersonal information‚Äù, and ‚ÄúAustralian Privacy Principle(s)‚Äù have  the meaning attributed to that term in the <em>Privacy Act (Cth) 1988 </em>(<strong>‚ÄúPrivacy Act‚Äù</strong>).
    </p>
    <p>
        This Statement has been prepared by SEEK Limited (ACN 080 075 314) (<strong>‚ÄúSEEK‚Äù</strong>).
    </p>
    <p>SEEK owns and operates the website located at www.seek.com.au (across desktop, mobile, tablet and apps and including any subdomains) (<strong>‚Äúthe Site‚Äù</strong>). This Statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Site.</p>
    <p>SEEK‚Äôs wholly owned subsidiaries, SEEK Learning Pty Ltd (ACN 084 202 719) (<strong>‚ÄúSEEK Learning‚Äù</strong>) and SEEK Business Pty Ltd (ACN 122 162 029) (<strong>‚ÄúSEEK Business‚Äù</strong>) own and operate the websites located at www.seeklearning.com.au and www.seekbusiness.com.au respectively across desktop, mobile, tablet and apps (including any subdomains).</p>
    <p>In this Statement, any reference to <strong>‚ÄúSEEK‚Äù</strong>, <strong>‚Äúwe‚Äù</strong>, <strong>‚Äúus‚Äù</strong> and <strong>‚Äúour‚Äù</strong> includes a reference to SEEK Limited, SEEK Learning and SEEK Business.</p>
    <p>
        Visitors of the Site who do not create an account are referred to generically in this Statement as <strong>‚Äúusers‚Äù</strong> or <strong>‚Äúyou‚Äù</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users who register on the Site to obtain services offered by SEEK are referred to as <strong>‚ÄúRegistered Users‚Äù</strong>. Unless the context provides otherwise, references in this Statement to ‚Äúusers‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äù include references to generic users and Registered Users.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="grid_12 mod-section grid_pad_32">
    <h2>Collecting information on SEEK visitors</h2>
    <p>
        SEEK collects non-personal information on Site visits including, without limitation, which sections of the Site are most frequently visited, how often, and
    for how long. This data is always used as aggregated, non-personal information, and may be shared with SEEK partners to provide them with information
    relating to how SEEK visitors 'use' the Site. This is done for the purpose of providing you with the best and most efficient career management services.
    </p>
    <h2>IP Addresses</h2>
    <p>
        SEEK's web servers gather your IP address to assist with the diagnosis of problems
    or support issues with our services, and to monitor the use of our Site.
    </p>
    <h2>Cookies &amp; Applets</h2>
    <p>
        SEEK uses cookies and applets to provide you with a better browsing experience and tailor advertisements that appear, (on the Site or other websites) to your browsing preferences and/or your SEEK Profile, (as defined below).
        These cookies and applets collect non-personal information such as preferences and click activity for measurement and for features such as remembering your details for 'Auto Login' (provided you have chosen this option), and remembering your search criteria for the 'My Last Search' function.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users who do not wish to have cookies active whilst they browse the Site can "opt out" by modifying the privacy options in your browser. However, doing so     will prevent access to some areas of the Site and limit your use of some of the SEEK services.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the above, where users access the SEEK iPhone mobile application ("<strong>SEEK iPhone App</strong>") we use third party software development kits (SDK's) and services which collect non personal information relating to your use of the SEEK iPhone App, including tracking of app installs and re-engagement.  This information is used to tailor and measure advertisements to install and/or use the SEEK iPhone App which appear on third party sites/apps and are targeted towards users' usage preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users who want to opt-out from the collection and usage of information for advertisement targeting can do so by enabling "Limit Ad Tracking" (Settings&gt;Privacy&gt;Advertising) on their iOS device.  By opting out from ad targeting SEEK and its third party providers will not use the collected information to target ads to you, however the information collected may continue to be used by SEEK for, amongst other things, estimation of user numbers, advertising fraud detection and debugging.
    </p>
    <h2>Third Party Measurement</h2>
    <p>
        In order to better understand our users, SEEK utilises third party measurement companies to assess Site and mobile Site traffic. A tracking code is used to collect the following information on the usage of the Site:
    </p>
    <ul class="mod-middot-outside">
        <li>The number of page views (or page impressions) that occur on SEEK;</li>
        <li>The number of unique visitors to SEEK;</li>
        <li>How long these unique visitors (on average) spend on SEEK when they do visit; and</li>
        <li>Common entry and exit points into SEEK.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This aggregate, non-personal information is collated and provided to SEEK to assist in analysing the usage of the Site. This data is also accessible by
    media organisations and research companies, for the purpose of conducting industry comparisons with other Internet websites.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="grid_12 mod-section grid_pad_32">
    <h2>Collecting information on SEEK Registered Users</h2>
    <p>
        As part of registering with SEEK, we collect personal information about Registered Users in order for Registered Users to take full advantage of SEEK's
    services. To do this it will be necessary for Registered Users to provide additional information to SEEK.
    </p>
    <h2>Registration</h2>
    <p>
        Becoming a Registered User allows you to take advantage of more of the tools, services and resources that may assist you in finding a job. To become a Registered User you will need to submit
    some personal information such as your name and email address. You may access your information at any time by clicking <a href="/settings" title="Update your communication settings">'Settings'</a> on 'the Site'.
    </p>
    <p>
        SEEK may also use this information in order to customise the service we provide to you. For example, SEEK may use this information to create a SEEK Profile
    that you may choose to use in the future. However, we will never activate this SEEK Profile (or any other service) without your express consent.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="grid_12 mod-section grid_pad_32">
    <h2>Job Mail</h2>
    <p>
        Job Mail is an optional service available to Registered Users. SEEK requests that Registered Users provide their email address, and information relating to
    their employment preferences, in order that SEEK can notify Registered Users via email of jobs specific to their specified criteria. Registered Users can
    modify or delete their Job Mail preferences (or their Job Mail account) at any time by going to the '<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/MyActivity">My Activity</a>' area of the Site.
    </p>
        <p>Users of the Site may also subscribe to Job Mail without creating a SEEK Profile and becoming a Registered User by electing to do so when searching for jobs on the Site.
        If you choose to subscribe to Job Mail in this manner, any personal information you provide us when creating your Job Mail subscription will be stored and used by SEEK
        in the same manner as if you were a Registered User. You will be able to unsubscribe from Job Mail subscriptions at any point in time by clicking on the unsubscribe
        link within the  email. In order to best utilise SEEK's services, we recommend creating a SEEK Profile (see below).</p>
</div>
<div class="grid_12 mod-section grid_pad_32">
    <h2>Storing your resume</h2>
    <p>
        Registered Users may elect to store up to 10 resumes in their '<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/MyActivity">My Activity</a>' area, and use those resumes
    when applying for a job. Deleting a resume from the '<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/MyActivity">My Activity</a>' area will mean it is no longer accessible
    to the Registered User. Deleted records may still be stored by SEEK in testing or backup systems for a period of time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where resumes are held in testing environments, these are held in closed and secure environments and information is only used for the purpose of internal software testing. Information held in backup systems is only held for the purposes of backing up systems in the event of a data loss.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="grid_12 mod-section grid_pad_32">
    <h2>SEEK Profile</h2>
    <p>A SEEK Profile can include a resume, employment and educational history, contact details, minimum salary expectations, and preferred job classifications and locations. Advertisers are able to search SEEK's Profile database to find and contact relevant candidates. Upon registration, all users
        will be asked to create a personal SEEK Profile ('<strong><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/Profile?cid=sk%3Amain%3Aau%3Aprivacyprofile%3Aseekprofile">SEEK Profile</a></strong>')
        by providing some key information and selecting one of the privacy settings outlined below. Users without SEEK Profiles will also be required to create a SEEK Profile when applying for jobs on the Site.
        Users can elect how much of their SEEK profile they wish to share (if any) with Advertisers based on the following privacy settings:
    </p>

                Your SEEK Profile, except for your resume and contact details, can be seen by Advertisers searching the SEEK Profile database, and if an Advertiser wishes
        to purchase access to your SEEK Profile, your full SEEK Profile including your resume and contact details will be emailed immediately to the relevant
        Advertiser.
            </p>

            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Hidden </strong>
            <p>
                Your SEEK Profile is completely hidden (thereby preventing Advertisers from viewing your SEEK Profile). Your SEEK Profile will be stored in the '<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/Profile?cid=sk%3Amain%3Aau%3Aprivacyprofile%3Aprofile">Profile</a>'
        area of the Site and you may alter the privacy settings at any time.
            </p>
            <p>If you have a standard or limited SEEK Profile then Advertisers searching SEEK's Profile database may also elect to send you a copy of a job opportunity for which they are recruiting, (by using the "send job" function), or send you a customised email about a job opportunity, (by using the "message") function. Advertisers who use either of these functions do not, by using those functions, receive access to any of your personal information. </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All information provided when creating a SEEK Profile (including your name, resume, email address, telephone numbers, employment and educational history)
    may be used by SEEK for the purpose of improving placement opportunities for you or for tailoring specific products to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Registered Users can modify their resume at any time, or modify the privacy options in relation to their SEEK Profile at any time, by going to the Profile
    area of the Site.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may also elect to clear your SEEK Profile altogether. Cleared SEEK Profiles may still however be stored by SEEK in testing or backup systems for a period of time. SEEK reserves the right to disable or clear a SEEK Profile at its sole discretion (for example if information is found or believed to be untrue or being stored for improper purposes).Where SEEK takes such action, we will delete and no longer hold your information.

    <h2>SEEK Advertisers and Online Applications</h2>
    <p>
       Making an online application to a job advertisement on SEEK is a free and optional service that requires
        users to complete mandatory fields (for example first name, last name, phone and email) so that the Advertiser can identify and contact the applicant. When applying for a job, users who do not have
         a SEEK Profile will also be required to create a SEEK Profile based on the information contained in their application ‚Äì this may be subsequently edited by users [<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/Profile?cid=sk%3Amain%3Aau%3Aprivacyprofile%3Aprofile">here</a>].
        Registered Users will also have the option of easily attaching a saved resume. When you apply for a job advertisement on the site applications, including attachments and cover letters, are:
    </p>
    <ul class="mod-middot-outside">
        <li>forwarded directly on to the Advertiser and/or its nominated representative; or
        </li>
        <li>stored in the SEEK Advertiser Centre on behalf of the Advertiser. The SEEK Advertiser Centre allows Advertisers to easily and effectively manage
        their recruitment process via one central facility made available by SEEK.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Some advertisers may also require you to answer a list of questions selected by that Advertiser as part of your online application. By answering the Application questions you acknowledge that SEEK will provide your answers to that advertiser and may use your answers to improve our products, including through improving our search and matching capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        By applying to a position advertised on SEEK you are requesting that SEEK pass the information you provide to the relevant Advertiser and/or their nominated representative. Any questions you have relating to a position advertised on SEEK, your online application and/or the status of your application should be directed directly to the Advertiser or their nominated agent, not SEEK.
    </p>
    <p>
        Advertisers that place job ads on SEEK, and that purchase SEEK Profiles are asked by SEEK to comply with all relevant obligations relating to the use and disclosure of personal information that are outlined in the Privacy Act. The use of your information (personal or otherwise) by these Advertisers is not within the control of SEEK and we cannot accept responsibility for the conduct of these companies.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the right to directly contact Advertisers to request access to any personal information that you have sent as part of an application or that has been provided to them as part of a SEEK Profile.
    </p>
    <p>
        SEEK will also retain this information in order to customise the service we provide to you. For example, SEEK may use this information to help create a SEEK Profile that you may choose to use in the future. However, we will never activate this SEEK Profile (or any other service) or disclose this information to any third party without the express consent of the relevant user. SEEK does however reserve the right to disable or delete a saved resume or cover letter at its discretion.
