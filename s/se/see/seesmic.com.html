  <h2>Privacy Policy and Copyright</h2>

  <section class="content">
    <h3></h3>
<p>Seesmic, Inc. (“Seesmic”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of http://www.seesmic.com (the “Site”) and of Seesmic applications, including but not limited to Seesmic Web, Seesmic Desktop, Seesmic Desktop 2, Seesmic Look, Seesmic for iPhone and iPod touch, Seesmic for Android (the “Applications”). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Site and the Applications. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service (http://seesmic.com/tos/).</p>
<p>As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.</p>
<h3>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h3>
<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, Applications, services, features and content, to administer your Membership (together, the “Service”) and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site and Applications.</p>
<h3>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.</h3>
<ul>
<li>When you register with us through the Site or the Applications or when you first start using the Site or the Applications, as a Seesmic Subscriber we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.</li>
<li>We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your account (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences) (“Non-Identifying Information”).</li>
<li>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.</li>
<li>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Seesmic Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Site, Applications and Service are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</li>
<li>We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Seesmic newsletters and marketing or promotional materials that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.</li>
</ul>
<h3>LOG DATA</h3>
<p>When you visit the Site or Applications, whether as a Seesmic Subscriber or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a “Seesmic User”), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or that the Applications send when you use them (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site or Applications, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site, the Applications and the Service and for the Site’s and Applications’ technical administration, to increase our Site’s and Applications’ functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests.</p>
<h3>COOKIES</h3>
<p>Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by Seesmic Users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Service and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all or – in certain situations any – portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service.</p>
<h3>COMMUNICATING VIA A SEESMIC ACCOUNT</h3>
<p>As part of the Service, Seesmic Subscribers may communicate with Seesmic Subscribers and non-registered users through use of their accounts. Our Site and Applications are actually designed to help you share information, not solely with Seesmic Subscribers and not-registered users, but also with any users of the services such as Twitter or Facebook you might be accessing through our Site or Applications. As such, some of the information you provide to us in order to communicate it will be made public. This includes the messages you post and the metadata provided along with your messages, such the date and time at which you posted your messages and many other bits of information. Further, where Seesmic Subscribers have selected the option of adding one or more contacts (Seesmic Subscribers or non-registered users) to their account, the message they create will be sent from Seesmic either to one or more of their contacts or posted on a service such as Twitter on their behalf. These contacts information will be stored in the Seesmic Subscriber’s account under Contacts and will be used for the purpose of sending messages to the addressees.</p>
<h3>PHISHING</h3>
<p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to Seesmic. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.</p>
<h3>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</h3>
<p>Seesmic Subscribers. When you register through the Site or the Applications and submit your Personal Information to create an account, Seesmic Users will see – when this functionality is available – your “Screen Name” and the month and year you first registered with Seesmic (“Required Subscriber Identifiers”). When this functionality is available, you can choose what other Personal Information you provide as part of your profile (“Other Subscriber Information”) and in some cases you can choose whether to share that information publicly on the Site or the Applications by making selections via the “user preferences” section of your account. When this functionality is available, we will display your Personal Information on your profile page and elsewhere on the Site and Applications according to the preferences you set in your account. Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want other Seesmic Users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile. You can review and revise your profile information at any time.</p>
<p>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information. We may share aggregated information that includes your Personal Information, Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis and demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services.</p>
<p>Service Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related or Applications-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site, Applications and Service are used. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. We may also provide Personal Information to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information on goods or services we believe will be of interest to you. You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such communications.</p>
<p>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. Seesmic cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Seesmic or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>
<p>Business Transfers. Seesmic may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. Seesmic will notify you before transferring your information to a new entity as part of a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of some or all of its assets if the new entity’s processing of your information will materially differ from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>CHANGING OR DELETING YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
<p>All Subscribers may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us. If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us at privacy@seesmic.com with a request that we delete your Personal Information from our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>
<h3>SECURITY</h3>
<p>Seesmic is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.</p>
<p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>
<h3>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</h3>
<p>Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Seesmic may transfer Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
<h3>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h3>
<p>Our Site and Applications contains links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>
<h3>OUR POLICY TOWARD CHILDREN</h3>
<p>This Site is not directed to children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@seesmic.com. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.</p>
<h3>CONTACTING US</h3>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@seesmic.com or at: Privacy Matters c/o Seesmic 1550 Bryant Street – Suite 890 San Francisco, CA 94103 USA</p>
