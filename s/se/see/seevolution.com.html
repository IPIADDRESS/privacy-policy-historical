        <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE</h2>
        <h3>Users of Websites on which the Service is Implemented</h3>
        <p>SeeVolution clients use SeeVolution's Service to obtain information regarding how visitors to their websites are interacting with their web pages ("Visitor Information"). This allows SeeVolution's clients to improve the functions of its website and make it easier and more valuable for visitors to use. Please note that SeeVolution itself uses the SeeVolution Service to obtain insights into visitors' activities on http://www.seevolution.com. The data SeeVolution collects may include customized data that varies from client to client but typically includes information about visitors' activities on the client's website, such as how visitors navigate around a web page and the most commonly clicked links on a specific web page. SeeVolution may also collect certain Information about a visitor's computer that may be furnished by the visitor's browser, such as: Browser Information, Operating System Information, Mobile Device Information (e.g., device identifier, mobile operating system, etc.), IP Address, Page Accessed, Geographic Location, Time of Visit, Referring Site, Application, or Service. SeeVolution's Service is not designed to collect Information that could be used to personally identify you, such as your name, address or phone number ("Personally Identifiable Information") when you visit a website that uses the SeeVolution Service. However, please be aware that SeeVolution allows its clients to provide it with customized data that may, depending on the election of the client, contain Personally Identifiable Information. SeeVolution does not collect or aggregate information about visitor behavior on multiple, different websites. If a visitor navigates to a website that uses the SeeVolution Service from another website, SeeVolution may receive certain information from the referring website (i.e., the last website the visitor visited before visiting the client's website) as part of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ("HTTP") request. For example, if a user navigates to a website that uses SeeVolution from a search engine, such as Google, SeeVolution may receive information contained in the referring URL for the Google search query, such as the terms the visitor was searching for before visiting the SeeVolution client's website. SeeVolution may use information contained in the referring URL to analyze and provide information to its clients about the activities that led users to navigate to the client's website.</p>
        <h3>Users of Our Service</h3>
        <p>We collect and store information that registered users of Our Service ("Clients") submit to Us, such as their names and e-mail addresses, to allow Us to identify users and notify them of changes or updates to the Service. When you provide us your e-mail address, you automatically opt-in to receive e-mails from Us (including marketing e-mails). If you would like to opt-out of these marketing e-mails, you can change your settings through your account page. If a Member elects to provide it, We also collect and store your name and phone number, which We use to assist Us in providing the Service to you. We also collect other information, such as your IP address and browser type. We use the IP addresses of Clients to assist in login and other uses related to a registered user's use of the Service. Member's sessions on Our sites are also tracked for systems administration purposes and to track user trends. We may link IP address and other information to a Member's account.</p>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>Like many other websites, SeeVolution uses first-party cookies (small text files stored locally on your computer) on client sites for one or more of the following purposes: to help identify visitors; assess usage patterns and perform traffic analysis; identify preferences; diagnose problems with our servers; analyze trends; and otherwise administer SeeVolution products and services. Cookies placed by SeeVolution on the computers of visitors to its clients' websites do not include Personally Identifiable Information such as name, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address, nor does SeeVolution link cookies to such Personally Identifiable Information in its servers or databases. If you do not wish to have SeeVolution place and use cookies on your computer, you should set your browser preferences to refuse all cookies, including first-party cookies, before accessing SeeVolution or other websites that may use SeeVolution. SeeVolution is not responsible for any failure by you or your browser to accurately implement or communicate your browser preferences or settings. Please note that if you set your browser to reject cookies, some features of the websites you visit may be unavailable. In addition, please be aware that even if you configure your browser settings to reject all cookies, your activity on SeeVolution client websites will still be recorded by the Service. However, if you reject all cookies, SeeVolution will not be able to determine whether or not someone using that computer previously visited the website i.e. whether or not the visitor is a "unique" visitor. For more information on how to reject cookies, see your browser's instructions on changing your cookie settings. If you do not elect to set your browser preferences to refuse cookies, you consent to have cookies, including first-party cookies used by SeeVolution, placed on your computer when you visit websites.</p>
        <h2>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <h3>IP Addresses</h3>
        <p>We generally use the information We collect from you to create a secure and personalized Service for Our Clients.</p>
        <p>We gather this information for systems administration purposes, abuse prevention and to track user trends. We may also use your IP address to identify the general geographic area from which you are accessing a website on which the Service is implemented. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information.</p>
        <h3>Header Information</h3>
        <p>Header information is used to determine which websites originated traffic into websites implementing the Service.</p>
        <h3>Traffic Data</h3>
        <p>Traffic Data is used to provide Clients with real-time analytics. We may aggregate and anonymize Traffic Data with that from other sites to provide benchmarking data and other functionality, but no identifiable Traffic Data will be disclosed at any time without your express prior consent.</p>
        <h3>User ID and Password Information</h3>
        <p>For Clients, We collect user ID and password information to enable them to log into and use the Service.</p>
        <h3>Member E-Mail Addresses</h3>
        <p>Clients are automatically opted-in to receive marketing emails from us when they register for the Service. Clients can opt-out of such emails by adjusting their account settings, provided that we may still send Clients e-mails relating to their account.</p>
        <h3>Member Names and Phone Numbers</h3>
        <p>For Clients, We optionally collect their names and phone numbers, which allow Us to contact them in account recovery and other scenarios.</p>
        <h2>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</h2>
        <h3>Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We will not sell, lease or exchange your personal information to third parties without first obtaining your express consent, unless required by law or to protect your status as a Member. To the extent We do disclose your personal information to a third party to protect your status as a Member, We will notify you of that disclosure.</p>
        <h3>Traffic Data</h3>
        <p>We may aggregate and anonymize your Traffic Data with that from other sites to provide benchmarking data and other functionality, but no personally identifiable Traffic Data will be disclosed at any time without your express prior consent.</p>
        <h3>Your Authorization Required</h3>
        <p>We will not use or share your personal information in ways incompatible with the ones described above, or other than as you have explicitly authorized, without providing you a choice. If at any time We would like to disclose your personal information to a third party in a manner not described above, We will provide you with an affirmative or explicit (opt in) choice. Personal information will not be used to directly market the Service unless that possible use of the information has been disclosed and a choice provided.</p>
        <h3>Email Opt-Out</h3>
        <p>As noted above, Clients may choose not to receive marketing emails from Us. You can opt out of such e-mails through your account settings.</p>
        <h2>ACCESS</h2>
        <h3>Access</h3>
        <p>Through your Member account, We will provide you access to personally identifiable information about you that We store in a manner that is identifiable as your personal information. Note, however, that for non-Clients, We don't retain IP addresses, browser information or header information for more than a temporary period of time in order to provide the Service, and as such, that information cannot be accessed or modified. We will allow you to correct, amend or delete personal information of yours that We retain where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of other persons would be violated.</p>
        <h3>Deletion</h3>
        <p>Clients who leave the Service may choose to have their personal information deleted by contacting legal@SeeVolution.com.<script type="text/javascript">

        <h2>LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</h2>
        <p>Our websites may contain links to third party websites. Please be aware that We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third party websites you choose to visit. If you provide any information directly to parties other than Us, different rules may apply to the use or disclosure of that information. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing your personal information to third parties.</p>
        <h2>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS</h2>
        <p>We may choose to deploy advertising on the Service that is delivered to users through a third party's advertising server. Information about users' visits to Our websites, such as the number of times a user has viewed an ad (but no personally identifiable information), would be used in such a scenario to serve ads to users on Our websites.</p>
        <h2>VOLUNTARY PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>Please be aware that whenever Clients voluntarily disclose personal information online - e.g., on message boards, in chat areas, in file uploads, through events, etc. - that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others; We have no control over, and take no responsibility for, the use, storage or dissemination of such publicly-disclosed personal information. By posting personal information online in public forums, Clients may receive unsolicited messages from other parties.</p>
        <h2>PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN</h2>
        <p>In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), We will not knowingly provide access to the Service to persons under the age of thirteen (13). If We later learn that any user is under the age of thirteen (13), We will take appropriate steps to remove that user's information from the database and We will restrict that individual from future access to the Service.</p>
        <h2>SECURITY</h2>
        <p>We have implemented security measures to protect user information from loss, misuse and alteration. We use industry-standard practices such as encrypted storage, firewalls and password protection systems to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information. Each of Our employees is aware of Our security policies, and your information is only available to those employees who need it to perform their jobs.</p>
        <h2>CONSENT</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is a part of Our Terms of Use. By using the Service, users agree to be bound by the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. Some terms may be defined in the Terms of Use. This Privacy Policy only addresses activities originating from Our servers.</p>
        <h2>NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES</h2>
        <p>If We change this Privacy Policy and seek to use your personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, you will be notified via e-mail or otherwise in some manner through the Service. In addition, if We make any material changes in Our privacy practices that do not affect personal information already stored by Us, We will post a notice on Our websites notifying users of the change. In some cases where We post such a notice, We will also e-mail users who have opted to receive communications from Us to notify them of the changes in Our privacy practices.</p>
        <h2>SAFE HARBOR PRIVACY STATEMENT</h2>
        <p>SeeVolution complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
