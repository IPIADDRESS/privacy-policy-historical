      <h2>Your Privacy is important to us.</h2>
      <p>Effective February 27, 2014</p>
      <h3>The Really Big Picture</h3>
      <p>
      Your privacy is critically important to us. At Shareaholic we have a few fundamental guiding principles:</p>
      <ul class="privacy-summary">
        <li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.  (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or  income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
        <li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop and operate our products, or protect our rights.</li>
        <li>We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
        <li>In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public and kept private.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>
      <p>Shareaholic, Inc. ("<strong>Shareaholic</strong>") operates several products, services and websites including <a href="http://www.shareaholic.com/">shareaholic.com</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.buzzster.com/">buzzster.com</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openshareicons.com/">openshareicons.com</a>. It is Shareaholic's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our services.
      </p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy covers Shareaholic's treatment of personal information gathered when you use any of Shareaholic's services.</p>
      
      <h3>Keeping Information Secure</h3>
      
      <p>Shareaholic takes measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures.</p>
      
      <p>We restrict access to personal information to Shareaholic employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
      
      <p>Your Shareaholic account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You will need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.</p>

      <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
      
      <p>"Personal information" is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information by Shareaholic.</p>

      <p>Certain  users choose to interact with  our services in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Shareaholic gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at shareaholic.com to provide a username and email address. In each case, Shareaholic collects such information only insofar as is  necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the users  interaction with Shareaholic.</p>
      
      <p>Because Shareaholic enables people to discover and share information with one another, information about the people who use Shareaholic is an integral part of the Shareaholic experience. Rest assured that Shareaholic does not disclose  personally-identifying information other than as described below. And  users can always refuse to supply personally-identifying  information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging with certain services.</p>

      <h3>Information we collect and how we use it</h3>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Information you provide to us: </strong>We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.
          
          Spam stinks. So we do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent. We respect  your privacy and hate SPAM too.</li>
          
        <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> To serve you faster and with better quality, we use "cookies" technology.

        <li><strong>User Profile information:</strong> Certain information collected during registration and subsequent visits, such as your full name and location, may be displayed to other Shareaholic users in your User Profile. The User Profile is the area on Shareaholic where we allow you to tell other Shareaholic users about yourself and your interests.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Member Directory:</strong> The e-mail address that you submit upon registration may be searchable by other Shareaholic users who know you by your email address, unless you choose to opt out of this feature. This is primarily so that other users can find you to establish a connection on Shareaholic. You may opt-out of this feature at any time by visiting the Settings section of your User Profile.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Aggregated statistics:</strong> We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information such as but not limited to the number of users who engaged in a particular topic, correlations between sharing and item preferences, and how many users chose to share a piece of content.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Other sites:</strong> This Privacy Policy applies to Shareaholic services only. We do not exercise control over the sites that include Shareaholic applications, products or services, or links from within our various services. We also do not recommend or endorse and are not responsible for these sites or their content, products, services or privacy policies or practices. These other third party sites operate under their own privacy and security policy and may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. If you choose to obtain certain services through a third party site, the data collected by the third party is governed by that third party's privacy policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>In addition, some Shareaholic services may send limited additional information to Shareaholic:</strong></p>

      <h3>Browser Tools &amp; Plugins</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Application ID:</strong> Shareaholic's browser tools may include one or more unique application ID's. These numbers and information about your installation of Shareaholic (e.g., version number, language) may be used when you first install and use it, when Shareaholic periodically contacts our servers (for example, to check for updates), and may be required for certain plugin features to function properly.  Some features may also send data to Shareaholic at the time of use.  For example, sharing works by sending to Shareaholic the URL, page title, and other relevant data in order to complete the task.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Statistics Monitor (optional feature) &amp; Third-parties: </strong> To be able to provide you with diverse and extensive URL and website related information the browser tool may exchange data with certain third-party service providers like Delicious ("Delicious"), a Yahoo! Inc. company, Google Inc. ("Google"), Compete Inc. ("Compete"), Bitly Inc. (Bitly), Digg Inc. ("Digg"), and other Web statistics providers.  This behavior is intrinsic to the functioning of this feature. For example, only by knowing which web page you are viewing can the browser tool show you information about that web page or website.  This information will not be sent and statistics and other rich information from these service providers will not be accessible to you if you disable the "Website Stats Monitor", and service options for statistics providers like Digg, Delicious and others through the Browser Tool Options window. You can disable (or re-enable) any of these features at any time.
          
          The data that may be collected by these third-party service providers is governed by that third party's privacy policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services.  A third-party service provider may process aggregated non-personally identifiable data on an anonymous and aggregate basis in order to operate and improve its service, for research purposes, or to prepare reports about aggregate usage. "Aggregated non-personal information" is information that no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user.
          
        </li>

        <li><strong>URLs and embedded information:</strong> For example, when you have the "Website Statistics Monitor" feature enabled, the browser tools may send the uniform resource locators ("URLs") of web pages that you request to Shareaholic, and website or web page statistics provider like Digg.  When you use these services, Shareaholic or a  third-party statistics providers may receive the URL sent by the websites you visit, including, any personal information inserted into those URLs by the website operator.

          For example, when you submit information to a web page (such as a user login ID or registration information), the operator of that website may "embed" that information – including personal information – into its URL (typically, after a question mark ("?") in the URL). When the URL is sent to Shareaholic or a third party service provider, servers may automatically store the URL, including any personal information that has been embedded after the question mark. Shareaholic does not exercise any control over these websites or whether they embed personal information into URLs.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
