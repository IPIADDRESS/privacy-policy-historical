            you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance 
            with the policies and practices described in this Statement. For example, 
            such information may be used for the purpose of determining your potential

          </p>
          <p align="left"> We may disclose such information to third parties if 
            you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you indicate that 
            you would like to receive information about the products or services 
            of third parties at the time you register for an account, we may supply 
            your contact information to third parties such as employers, recruiters, 
            data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you 
            e-mail or otherwise communicating with you. We may use data we have 
            about you (such as the interests and preferences you have expressed)

            of a particular third-party </p>
          <p align="left">We may disclose such information to companies and individuals 
            we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include 
            hosting our Web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance,

            information with any other third party. </p>
          <p align="left">We may disclose such information if legally required 
            to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we 
            believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform 
            to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect the 
            rights or property of SexyJobs.com or its affiliated companies; (c)

            business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation 
            or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, 
            in the event SexyJobs.com becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, 
            whether voluntary or involuntary, SexyJobs.com or its trustee in bankruptcy 
            may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction

          <p align="left"><b>6. Resumes</b></p>
          <p align="left">Since SexyJobs.com is a career site, we give you the 
            option of putting your resume in our searchable database. When you 
            do so, then all parties with access to our resume database (or copies 
            thereof) will have access to your resume. We attempt to limit access 
            to our searchable database (or copies thereof) only to paying employers, 
            recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals, 
            as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but cannot 
            guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. 
            We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties 
            who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. 
            You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. 
            However, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access 
            to that database or to obtain a copy of that database, as well as 
            parties who have otherwise gained access to the database, may have 
            retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We 
            are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes in 
            these instances. </p>

          <p align="left">SexyJobs.com uses "cookies" to help personalize

            Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. 
            Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read

          <p align="left">One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide

            to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. 
            For example, if you personalize SexyJobs.com pages, or register for 
            services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such 
            as user name, password and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, 
            we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized 
            site experience. When you return to the SexyJobs.com site, the information 
            you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the 
            features that you customized. We also use cookies to track click streams 
            and for load balancing. </p>
          <p align="left">You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. 
            Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually 
            modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. 
            Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify 
            you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline 
            cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, 
            however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience 
            on the SexyJobs.com Web site. </p>
