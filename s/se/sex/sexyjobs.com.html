          <p align="left"><b>1. A Special Note About Children</b></p>
          <p align="left">Children under eighteen years of age are not eligible 
            to use our services. We ask that children do not submit information

          <p align="left">Your data will be stored and processed in whole or in 
            part in the United States. If you access SexyJobs.com outside the

          <p align="left"><b>3. Collection and Retention of Information</b></p>
          <p align="left">In some areas of our Web Site, SexyJobs.com requests 
            or may request that you provide personal information, including your 
            name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, 
            social security number, contact information, billing information and 
            any other information from which your identity is discernible. In 
            other areas, SexyJobs.com collects or may collect demographic information 
            that is not unique to you such as your ZIP code, age, preferences, 
            gender, interests and favorites. Sometimes we collect or may collect 
            a combination of the two types of information. Examples of areas on 
            SexyJobs.com where we collect personal or combined personal and demographic 
            data are pages where you can sign up to use a service, post a resume,or 
            purchase a product.</p>
          <p align="left">We also gather or may gather certain information about 
            your use of our site, such as what areas you visit and what services 
            you access. Moreover, there is information about your computer hardware 
            and software that is or may be collected by SexyJobs.com. This information

            names, access times and referring Web site addresses. </p>
          <p align="left">SexyJobs.com may sometimes afford you the opportunity 
            to provide descriptive, cultural, behavioral, preferential and/or 
            life style information about yourself, but it is solely up to you 
            whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, 
            you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance 
            with the policies and practices described in this Statement. For example, 
            such information may be used for the purpose of determining your potential 
            interest in receiving email or other communications about particular 
            products or services. </p>
          <p align="left">Please remember that if you post any of your personal 
            information in public areas of SexyJobs.com, such as if you post your 
            resume to our talent database, such information may be collected and

            for the use made by third parties of information you post or otherwise

            from our online database or close your account at any time, in which 
            event we will remove all our copies of your resume and SexyJobs.com 
            account profile information except for an archival copy which is not 
            accessible on the Internet. </p>
          <p align="left"><b>4. Use of Information by SexyJobs.com</b></p>
          <p align="left">We use the information we gather on SexyJobs.com, whether

          <p align="left"><b>5. Disclosure of Information to Others</b></p>
          <p align="left">We do not disclose to third parties your personal information, 
            combined personal and demographic information or information about 
            your use of SexyJobs.com (such as the areas you visit or the services 
            you access), except as set forth in the following four subparagraphs. 
          </p>
          <p align="left"> We may disclose such information to third parties if 
            you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you indicate that 
            you would like to receive information about the products or services 
            of third parties at the time you register for an account, we may supply 
            your contact information to third parties such as employers, recruiters, 
            data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you 
            e-mail or otherwise communicating with you. We may use data we have 
            about you (such as the interests and preferences you have expressed) 
            to determine whether you might be interested in the products or services 
            of a particular third-party </p>
          <p align="left">We may disclose such information to companies and individuals 
            we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include 
            hosting our Web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, 
            processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These 
            companies and individuals will have access to your personal information 
            as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that 
            information with any other third party. </p>
          <p align="left">We may disclose such information if legally required 
            to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we 
            believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform 
            to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect the 
            rights or property of SexyJobs.com or its affiliated companies; (c) 
            prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal 
            safety of users or the public. </p>
          <p align="left">We may disclose and transfer such information to a third 
            party who acquires all or a substantial portion of SexyJobs.com's 
            business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation 
            or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, 
            in the event SexyJobs.com becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, 
            whether voluntary or involuntary, SexyJobs.com or its trustee in bankruptcy 
            may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction 
            approved by the bankruptcy court. </p>
          <p align="left"></p>
          <p align="left">SexyJobs.com may also share aggregated anonymous information 
            about visitors to each of its Web sites with its clients, partners 
            and other third parties so that they may understand the kinds of visitors 
            to SexyJobs.com's site and how those visitors use the site. </p>
          <p align="left"><b>6. Resumes</b></p>
          <p align="left">Since SexyJobs.com is a career site, we give you the 
            option of putting your resume in our searchable database. When you 
            do so, then all parties with access to our resume database (or copies 
            thereof) will have access to your resume. We attempt to limit access 
            to our searchable database (or copies thereof) only to paying employers, 
            recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals, 
            as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but cannot 
            guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. 
            We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties 
            who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. 
            You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. 
            However, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access 
            to that database or to obtain a copy of that database, as well as 
            parties who have otherwise gained access to the database, may have 
            retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We 
            are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes in 
            these instances. </p>

            and for load balancing. </p>
          <p align="left">You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. 
            Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually
