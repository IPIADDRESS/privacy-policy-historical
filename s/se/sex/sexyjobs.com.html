							<h2>Keyword Search Tips</h2>
							<p style="margin-top:5px;">Be sure to choose whether your search is for Jobs or Talent. If desired, you may may further narrow your search by Name, Location, or ID#. The keyword search tool defaults to performing AND searches. This means that if you enter a phrase such as <em>Chicago Dancer</em>, then the search tool will return results that contain both the words <em>Chicago</em> and <em>Dancer</em> (in any order). However, if you separate words with OR, then the search tool will return results that contain any of the words entered. If you enter a phrase in quotes, then it will return results that contain the words in the exact order they were entered.</p>

<p>These <b>âTerms of Serviceâ</b> (also called <b>âContractâ</b> and <b>âAgreementâ</b> here) constitute a contract between each âBasic Userâ (<b>âYouâ and âYourâ</b>) and Infonet Publications, Inc. <b>(âUs,â âWe,â or âOurâ)</b>, the operator of this Website; In consideration of the mutual warranties, representations and promises which You and We make to one another, and the licenses granted herein to one another, each contracting party agrees with the other as follows:</p>
<p>No one, including You, is permitted to use the services provided here to aid in securing work as an employee or an independent contractor or in the engagement of one or more workers to provide work or services as independent contractors without first entering into these Terms of Service with Us. Infonet Publications, Inc., the operator of this Website, may revise these Terms of Service at any time by updating this posting as explained below in more detail. You should visit this page periodically to review the Terms of Service, because they are binding on You, and You agree that You will do so as often as You visit this Website. Elsewhere in this Agreement, You also agree to consult that page as often as You access this Website.</p>

<p>A <b>âHelp Wanted Userâ</b> of this Website, as that term is used in this Agreement, is, (and the term âHelp Wanted Userâ is defined as) a person or entity, including You, who intends to use it to assist in, explore, or investigate into the hiring of one or more employees or in the engagement of one or more workers to provide work or services as independent contractors for purposes that are exclusively lawful in the place or jurisdiction where the work or services associated with the employment or engagement are to be performed and who purchases a subscription to use this Website and registers identity and contact information for that purpose; It is of no significance that the actual employment or engagement You are investigating will actually be made by another person or entity, that Your role may be limited as a âgo betweenâ such as a talent agent or other kind of agent, employee of the person or entity who may ultimately hire or engage, broker, employment service or the like, or that Your interest in hiring or engagement now may be purely preliminary, investigatory, informal, vague, or concerning a possibility at a remote time, if Your purpose is at least to aid Yourself or another person in deciding whether to eventually or ultimately hire or engage help for a lawful purpose. In general, a Help Wanted User gets access to resumes posted by persons seeking work with the means to send messages and view any available information posted by Job Seeker users. Help Wanted Users are also eligible to post Help Wanted ads. The terms <b>âJob Seeker Userâ and âBasic Userâ</b>, as used in this Agreement, include any person who responds to Your advertisement(s) or who himself or herself posts any advertisement or other posting that presents an availability to perform work or services in any kind of capacity. <b>âBasic Userâ</b> access is provided for the general viewing public, including those who are using this Website casually looking for work, and it is free of cost. Each person who accesses this Website, with or without any registration or any purchase of a subscription is referred to herein as a <b>âuserâ</b> and all such persons collectively are referred to herein as <b>âusersâ</b>. Basic Users are required to give their assent to a Terms of Service agreement, but they need not register themselves individually; They are permitted to search work available listings with an index/search utility, to access basic resources pertinent to a work search, and to view those areas which We may designate as free access areas for Basic Users who are looking for work, but they will not enjoy the ability post resumes. Basic Users may register with Us without cost to thereby become a <b>âSilver Job Seeker Userâ</b> or <a href="https://www.sexyjobs.com/jobseekers/">upgrade to a <b>âGold Job Seeker Userâ</b> subscription</a>. The members of both of the two Job Seeker classes are together referred to herein collectively as <b>âJob Seeker Usersâ</b> and they acquire the additional abilities to send messages and to view Help Wanted Usersâ available contact information and other areas which We may designate as access areas for one or both classes of Job Seeker Users. Job Seeker Users, unlike Basic Users will have the opportunity to post resumes and may obtain other advantages and/or preferences. Job Seeker Users of either class must also assent to a Terms of Service Agreement at the time of registration or subscription. These classes of subscription may change upon the posting of notice, from time to time, in the manner otherwise provided for amendment elsewhere in this Agreement, or in respect to other classes of users, if different, in the provisions of the respective Terms of Service agreement which governs the access of such other kinds of users to this Website.</p>

You, and those claiming though You, agree to assert any claim which You or they may have against Us, or any of Our heirs, assigns, officers, directors, managers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, or shareholders individually and not as a member of a class.</p>
							</li>
							<li><h3><span>300.300.200.400</span> No Waiver by Inaction</h3>
								<p>No failure by You or by Us to exercise any right or option under this Agreement or to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall nullify any provision of this Agreement or operate as a waiver of any of the failing Partyâs rights to exercise options or to enforce any provision with respect to similar or subsequent situations, disputes, or breaches.</p>

			<li><h3><span>300.400.</span> Integration, Amendment, and Duration</h3>
				<p>The scope and coverage of this Agreement between You and Us and the circumstances under which it may or shall be amended or terminated altogether are specified and shall be governed by the provisions of this Section 300.400 and by all of the Subsections hereunder, as well as the other applicable provisions of this Agreement</p>

				<ul>
					<li><h3><span>300.400.100</span> Entire Agreement</h3>
						<p>This written Agreement constitutes and memorializes the entire understanding and all of the promises, warranties, and agreements between You and Us. Any and all prior or contemporaneous proposals, understandings, expectations, agreements, promises, patterns of dealing, and warranties are hereby merged into this writing, and none survives or is enforceable except as contained in this Agreement. No one except Our officer may waive any obligation that You undertake herein or excuse, ratify, or condone any breach of this Agreement that You may commit, or change any of its terms, nor (without limitation) undertake to affect or modify any warranty or disclaimer of warranty contained herein, nor make any additional binding promise or representation to You, and if by him, he may waive, excuse, ratify, or condone effectively only in a written agreement executed manually by You and him, and with respect to any amendment, he may do so only in a Website post as provided for amendments under the terms of this Agreement at Section 200.100 herein.</p>
					</li>
					<li><h3><span>300.400.200</span> Amendment and Relation of Parties</h3>
						<p>We may, from time to time amend this Agreement as elsewhere described in greater detail in this Agreement at Section 200.100. You may propose amendments to Us in a physical writing (i.e. not by email) directed to Us, but no such proposal shall alter or become a part of this Agreement unless and until it is accepted by Us in a written (not email or electronic) execution under the manual signature of our Officer. Should we publish any amendment to this Agreement under the provisions of this Section and/or Section 200.100, You may request from Us, and We will promptly provide You, a summary of the amendment identifying its variance(s) from this Agreement. Both You and We stipulate that You and We deal here on an even field, that there exist many alternative advertising venues which publish help wanted and job or work opportunity want ads, and that We provide services through the Website for all kinds of commercial operators, some economically larger than Us and others that are smaller. You and We together stipulate that the provisions of this Agreement that provide for its amendment amount to a fair and reasonable procedure that equitably balances the reasonably foreseeable, eventual need to alter the terms governing our mutual relationship as a result of changing legal and business considerations over time and the difficulty of communication individually with large numbers of changing Website users using this or a similar template agreement, many or most of whom are actually anonymous to Us, who access the Website through many IP addresses, computers and devices which also change over time, in light of their use of public computers and other devices which they do not exclusively use or control, and in light of Your ability to do all of these things without notice to Us.</p>
					</li>
					<li><h3><span>300.400.300</span> Duration</h3>
						<p>This Agreement between You and Us, as it may be amended from time to time pursuant to Section 300.400.200, shall persist so long as You continue to use this Website or any Content or functionality provided by or through this Website.</p>
					</li>
					<li><h3><span>300.400.400</span> Termination</h3>
						<p>You may terminate this Agreement at any time when You decide to discontinue all further use of this Website and of any Content or functionality provided by or through this Website. Certain obligations assumed by You under this Agreement may survive its termination: Without limitation, Your duty of cooperation with Us as set forth at Section 300.300.100.200 of this Agreement, the hold harmless provisions located in Section 300.300.100.100 of this Agreement, and the enforcement of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason and remain binding upon You and those claiming through You. We may terminate this Agreement if we decide, in Our sole discretion, to discontinue operating this Website in its present format or offering services to the viewing public or any class of User or member, for cause, with or without notice and with or without an opportunity to rebut or respond, in our sole discretion, on account of 1) for cause, for Your violation of any provision of this Agreement, including without limitation the use restrictions specified in Section 100.200.200 and each Subsection thereunder, 2) for cause, for repeated copyright infringement by You, or by anyone for whom You are responsible, pursuant to Section 100.200.200.400, or 3) not for cause, for any reason or no reason in Our sole and absolute discretion. In case of any such termination, the terms of this Agreement concerning the warranties You have made to Us, the disclaimers of Warranties and the limitation of liability contained in this Agreement, shall survive. You agree that, If We terminate Your subscription for cause, You shall be entitled to no compensation or damages on that account, nor shall be entitled to any refund or return of any subscription fees paid to us; You further agree that if we terminate this Agreement, without just cause, You shall be entitled to no refund or damages greater than the last subscription fee that You paid to us. You stipulate that the damages that You might incur as a consequence of any termination are impossible to quantify, and that the cost of a monthly subscription is an honest estimate reached in good faith to estimate the economic value of such damages. You agree that, in the case that We terminate the operation of this Website, we may wholly and completely compensate You for the value of any service You have thereby lost by providing You with free access to any website featuring adult entertainment video for the balance of the Service Period for which You have paid after Our discontinuation of this Website, to be selected by Us in our reasonable discretion.</p>
