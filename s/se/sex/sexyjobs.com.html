            uses "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your online

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
            of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature 
            to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server 
            that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize 
            SexyJobs.com pages, or register for services, a cookie helps us to 
            recall your specific information (such as user name, password and 
            preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster 
            and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. 
            When you return to the SexyJobs.com site, the information you previously 
            provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that 
            you customized. We also use cookies to track click streams and for 
            load balancing. </font></p>

            be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie 
            is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual
