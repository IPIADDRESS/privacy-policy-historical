<p><br>
  <b>III. Personal Information CyberNet Collects and How It Is Used </b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>A. </b>CyberNet collects information in different ways from Visitors and 
    Members who access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web 
    sites accessible through our Service. We use this information primarily to 
    provide a customized experience as you use our Services and, generally, do 
    not share this information with third parties. However, we may disclose personal 
    information collected when we believe that such disclosure is required by 
    law. </p>
  <p><b>B. Registration. </b>Members are asked to provide certain personal information 
    when they sign up for our Services including name, address, telephone number, 
    billing information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal 
    computer being used to access the Services. The personal information collected 
    from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's 
    account (such as for billing purposes). This information is collected by our 
    credit card processors, and is not shared with third parties, unless specifically 
    stated otherwise or in special circumstances. </p>
  <p><b>D. Online Shopping. </b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>1. </b>At some of our Web sites, you can purchase products and services 
      or register to receive materials. In many cases, you may be asked to provide 
      contact information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, 
      and credit/debit card information. If you complete an order for someone 
      else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may 
      be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the recipient's 
      name, address, and phone number. CyberNet has no control over the third 
      parties' use of any personal information you provide when placing such an 
      order. Please exercise care when doing so.</p>
    <p><b>2. </b>If you order products or services directly from CyberNet, we 
      will use the personal information you provide only to process that order. 
      We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent 
      necessary to complete that order. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>E. Online Advertisements. </b>CyberNet displays online advertisements. 
    We are not affiliated with these third-party websites and are not responsible 
    for their use of information. 
  </p><p><b>F. Responses to Email Inquiries. </b> When Visitors or Members send email 
    inquiries to CyberNet's websites, the return email address is used to answer 
    the email inquiry we receive. CyberNet does not use the return email address 
    for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any 
    third party. </p>
  <p><b>G. Voluntary Customer Surveys. </b>We may periodically conduct both business 
    and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate 
    in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps 
    us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. 
    Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, 
    even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer 
    surveys is voluntary. </p>
  <p><b>H. Other Internet Data. </b>CyberNet also collects IP addresses, referral 
    URLs, browser preferences, the user's registration forms, surveys, and communications 
    transmitted through site applications. This information is used internally 
    to track how users come to be referred to our Sites for the purpose of compensating 
    our affiliates, advertisers, and other marketing entities. This information 
    may be disclosed to third-parties. If we choose to disclose information to 
    third-parties, this information shall consist of non-specific information 
    regarding site traffic and statistics. CyberNet never discloses any customer-specific 
    information to third parties unless it is reasonable to believe that doing 
    so is required by law, a binding contract, a Court Order, or other state, 
    local, or administrative regulation. </p>
  <p> <b>I. Special Cases.</b> It is CyberNet's policy not to use or share the 
    personal information about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to those 
    described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise 
    prohibit such unrelated uses. However, CyberNet may disclose personal information 
    about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services 
    or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole 
    discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <b>1) </b>To satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy 
      Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; 
      <br>
      <b>2) </b>To disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, 
      or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable 
      Use Policy or other user policies; <br>
      <b>3) </b>To operate the Services properly; <br>
      <b>4) </b>To protect CyberNet and our Members; <br>
      <b>5) </b>We will cooperate with law enforcement authorities, private-party 
      litigants, and others seeking information about our end users to the extent 
      required by applicable law. Examples of such cooperation include compliance 
      with discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, and writs. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>J. "Cookies" and How CyberNet Uses Them. </b>A "cookie" 
    is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit 
    certain Web sites. CyberNet may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes 
    track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services 
    we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. We may use a cookie 
    to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services 
    to you. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer 
    information. Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do 
    not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for 
    information collected through them.</p>
  <p><b>K. Company Email. </b>CyberNet does not currently engage in email promotions 
    to its members. Membership information is only used to help find your membership 
    information in the event you need to cancel, or otherwise change your membership. 
    You will have the option to join our mailing list. If you choose to join the 
    mailing list, your email address will be stored in our database and used periodically 
    to send you news and promotions about our services. You can be removed from 
    the list by following the link contained in the email instructing you on how 
    to unsubscribe. The only way for the user's email address to be added to our 
    email list is for the user to provide this information to us and then affirmatively 
    take a step to notify us that you wish to be added to the email list, either 
    explicitly, or by acquiescing to the conditions of an offer. Every email we 
    send you will have a link contained therein which will direct you to a site 
    where you can unsubscribe. These unsubscribe links, when clicked, will automatically 
    remove your email address from our database without any additional action 
    on your part. CyberNet takes all reasonable steps in order to adhere to this 
    policy, but CyberNet is not responsible for occasional technical malfunctions 
    which may result in additional unwanted emails being sent to you. Should this 
    occur, you are instructed to direct an inquiry to CyberNet's Customer Service 
    email which is support@cybernetentertainment.com. </p>

<p><b>IV. Our Commitment to Children's Protection. </b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>A. </b>Our sites are designed for adults, but not for use by anyone under 
    the age of 18. In light of that fact, the Children's Online Privacy Protection 
    Act of 1998 is not applicable to this site. </p>
  <p><b>B. We have no Web pages designed for younger users. </b>We make every 
    effort to ensure that our Web sites contain adequate warnings to make their 
    content obvious and to warn users under the age of 18 that they are not welcome 
    to view our Web sites, we believe that there is no substitute for proper parental 
    supervision of their children's internet use. Nevertheless, we will take any 
    steps possible to discourage those under the age of 18 from visiting our Web 
    sites. For further information about tips, tools, age-appropriate, or kid-friendly 
    Web sites and how to report online trouble, please visit www.getnetwise.org. 
  </p>

<p><br>
  <b>V. Public Forums and External Sites. </b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>A. </b>Please remember that any information you may disclose in our Member 
    Directory, or other public areas of our Web sites or the Internet, becomes 
    public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose 
    personal information in these public areas. </p>
  <p><b>B.</b> The Site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that 
    we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage 
    our users to be aware that when they leave our Site they should read the privacy 
    statements of each and every site that collects personally identifiable information.</p>
  <p><b>C.</b> If you choose to subscribe to one of CyberNet's websites as a "member," 
    your name, email address, mailing address, credit card information, and IP 
    address are stored by one of our billing companies. You may read the privacy 
    policies on their websites at www.paycom.net and www.jettis.com. These sites 
    are external entities, and once this information is transmitted to them we 
    are under no obligation to police their use of the information, and take no 
    steps to do so. All of the aforementioned information, with the exception 
    of your credit card information, is also stored on our servers. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>VI. CyberNet's Commitment to Data Security. </b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Services and Web sites we sponsor have security measures in place to protect 
    the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While 
    we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and 
    systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party 
    "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information. We take all 
    reasonable measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness 
    of cyber-criminals we are unable to guarantee that our security is 100% breach-proof. 
    You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite 
    our reasonable security measures. </p>
</blockquote>
