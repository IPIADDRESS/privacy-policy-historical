<h3>SexPlayCam.com Privacy Policy:</h3>
<br>

<div id="terms" class="box3 padtop">
<p>We are committed to protecting our users' privacy!</p>

<p>We at SexPlayCam.com offer this Privacy Policy ("Policy") to inform Users of the SexPlayCam.com ("Website") how we define, collect, use and disclose the personal information you provide to us. 
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to alter this Policy at any time. Alterations shall become effective immediately once posted on the Website. We will notify you of a 
substantive change to this Policy by posting a notice of such substantial change on the home page of the Website and we may also email you to notify you of such changes.   
Your continued use of the Website following the posting of changes and/or modifications will constitute your acceptance of the revised privacy policy.</p>

<p>By providing personal information to us, and by using the Website or Service, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this 
Policy.</p>

<p>Please read this Policy carefully and save it. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, you should leave the Website and discontinue use of the Service immediately. In addition, 
if you are an individual who wishes to become a Registered User or Member, you must read this Policy and indicate your acceptance of its terms by following the instructions on the 
<a href="/register">REGISTRATION [http://www.sexplaycam.com/register]</a> page and check the box labelled "I have read and agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. I confirm I have reached the age of majority in my jurisdiction." </p>

<p>For the purposes of this Policy, "personal information" shall mean any information that can identify an individual directly or through other reasonable means.</p>
</div>

<div id="terms" class="box3 padtop">
<h4>1) Information We Gather Automatically. </h4>

<p>Each time a visitor visits the Website, our servers collect certain non-personal technical information, including, but not necessarily limited to, the visitor's IP Address, referral data 
and browser/platform type. This information is recorded by the standard operation of SexPlayCam.com's Internet servers. We also count, track and aggregate a visitor's activity into our 
analysis of general traffic flows at the Website (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Website, etc.).  The information collected here cannot identify who 
you are as an individual.  However, we may use your IP addresses in cooperation with your Internet provider to identify you if we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms 
of Use or to protect our service, the Website, users or others.</p>

<p>We may merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may then at our discretion be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers.  We will not disclose your 
individual identity or personally identifiable data without your permission. </p>

<p>What are IP Addresses?  An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet provider whenever you're surfing the Internet.  We do not link IP 
addresses to personally identifiable information, which means that your session will be logged anonymously. </p>

<p>What are Cookies?  We use cookies to store visitors' preferences and to record session information, for purposes including ensuring that visitors are not repeatedly offered the same 
advertisements, and to customize advertising and web page content for individual users. A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier which we transfer to your hard drive through your web 
browser when you visit our Website. It enables our own system to recognise you when you visit our Website again and improve our service to you. Cookies may also be used to compile 
aggregate information about areas of our Website that are visited most frequently. </p>

<p>This traffic information can be used to enhance the content of our Website and make your use of it 
easier. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on the Website.  Note that you must enable cookies from 
SexPlayCam.com in order to use most functions on the Website. Nevertheless, if you wish to reject our cookies, you can configure your browser to do so (instructions for disabling cookies 
can be found in our FAQs <a href="/main/faq">here</a>. Please note that SexPlayCam.com allows third parties who are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access 
their cookies on your computer in a process that SexPlayCam.com does not control.  Advertisers' uses of cookies are subject to their own privacy policies, not this Policy.  Therefore, we 
suggest that you examine the privacy policies of such advertisers to learn how they may collect, use, share and disclose your personal information. </p>
</div>

<div id="terms" class="box3 padtop">
<h4>2) Information Required for Registration. </h4>

<p>SexPlayCam.com will identify to you the purposes for which it will collect or use personal information before or at the time the information is collected. 
The type of personal information we may request depends on and is related to the reason (or purpose) such personal information was provided to us. During the process to become a User of 
the Website, we ask for general identifying information to provide you with customized service. We gather personal contact information such as screen name, email address, and some 
demographic information such as age, gender and general geographic location.  Any other information you choose to enter, such as your personal interests and preferences and general 
indications of the type of partner you are looking for using the Service, is completely optional. </p>  

<p>We encourage Users to fill out their profiles as completely as possible, with the understanding that, once entered, contact information is treated anonymously and is not available to 
other SexPlayCam.com Users.  Any communications from other Users are done via our internal systems, which are used to match the message to you and generate an e-mail notification without 
disclosing any information aside from your chosen screen name.</p>

<p>The choice to provide us with your personal information is always yours. However, your decision to withhold particular information may result in limiting our ability to respond to your 
inquiries or provide you with the Services you requested. If a new purpose is identified for the use of the information collected, the new purpose will be explained prior to its new use. 
Unless the new purpose is required by law, your consent is required before information can be used for that purpose. 
Demographic information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals at any time.</p>  

<p>Note that, during the Membership process, third party billing agents will collect personally identifiable information required to process payments for the service. SexPlayCam.com retains
information (name and address) to correctly identify you in dealings with third party billing agents. Additional information gathered by third party billing agents is not controlled by 
SexPlayCam.com or this Policy. </p>

<div id="terms" class="box3 padtop">
<h4>3) Voluntary Inclusion of Personal Information. </h4>

SexPlayCam.com is not responsible for any privacy issues arising from your own voluntary posting or transmission of personal information via the Service.

other consequences, foreseen or unforeseen, of all information which you submit, publish, display, disseminate or otherwise communicate through the Website even if a claim for damages or 
liability should arise after termination of service.</p>
</div>

<div id="terms" class="box3 padtop">
<h4>4) Communication. </h4>

<p>The Website directly communicates with Members and Users through email, instant messaging, and in some cases, downloaded executables.  This enables Members to receive information when they
are not on the Website, so they remain current on internal communication and updates from other Users or from us directly. The Website may also use personally identifiable information 
within your profile to send information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your interests, such as special banners and promotions.  Should you not wish SexPlayCam.com to send you 
information on other services or products, please just contact us using the information provided in section 17 below.  </p>
<p>Members of the Website can directly communicate with you through messaging services that are part of the Service (mail, chat or via comments). We may use personally identifiable 
information within your profile to send notifications of these communications to you, but your personally identifiable information is not disclosed to other Members by us. </p>
</div>

<div id="terms" class="box3 padtop">
<h4>5) Referrals. </h4>

<p>If you choose to use our external referral service to tell a friend about the Website, we will ask you for your friend's contact information. The Website will automatically send your 
friend an e-mail inviting them to visit the Website. The Website maintains this information for the sole purpose of sending this email and tracking the success of the referral.</p>
</div>

<div id="terms" class="box3 padtop">
<h4>6) Your Use of Other Users' Information. </h4>

<p>You may not use other Users' information for commercial purposes, to send SPAM or SPIM, to harass, to make unlawful threats, or for any other illegal purpose. SexPlayCam.com reserves the right
to terminate the Service to those who misuse other Users' information.</p><p>
If you receive communications that you find to have violated this Policy, please contact us using the information provided in section 17 below, being sure to include the message text and 
the User who sent the communication to you.</p>
</div>

<div id="terms" class="box3 padtop">
<h4>7) Accuracy of Personal Information, Information Review and Removal. </h4>

<p>We shall make every reasonable effort to ensure your personal information is accurate, complete and up-to-date. You are responsible for advising SexPlayCam.com of any inaccuracies or changes 
to your personal information. </p>
<p>Users may modify or remove any of their information associated with their profile at any time by logging into their account and accessing the Edit Profile feature.</p>
<p>Users may, at any time, delete their profiles or remove any images or audio-visual material that they have posted to the Website.</p>
</div>

<div id="terms" class="box3 padtop">
<h4>8) Promotion. </h4>

<p>From time to time, SexPlayCam.com may sponsor sweepstakes, contests or other events of interest to our users.  SexPlayCam.com may co-sponsor these events with third party organizations, and may 
be required to share demographic information to be used for the event. Any shared demographic information will not be associated with individual users; it will only be presented as 
aggregated information. </p>
<p>In some cases, promotions or sweepstakes that may be of interest to our users may require us to share email information with third party sponsors or partners. A User's personal email 
information will not be released to any third party organization without the User's express consent and disclosure of the sponsor organization's name, and SexPlayCam.com will request that 
such named sponsors uphold the privacy of the registrant's information by not distributing or sharing such information with any other businesses or organizations, and we will ensure 
that such sponsors agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. </p> 

<p>Should you not wish to receive notices or be considered for sweepstakes, contests or other events, please contact us using the information provided in section 17 below. </p> 
</div>

<div id="terms" class="box3 padtop">
<h4>9) Disclosure and Retention of Personal Information. </h4>

<p>We will only use or disclose your personal information in accordance with the purposes for which it was originally collected unless you have otherwise consented, or when required or 
permitted by law.  We will keep your personal information only for so long as is required to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected or as required by law. 
Except as explained in this Policy, or as otherwise consented to by you, we do not disclose any personal information to third parties.  The following are the limited instances where we

all claims resulting from any and all actions taken by any of the foregoing during, or as a result of any law enforcement authority's investigations or inquiries.</li>

of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of all or substantially all of its assets or the sale of an individual website owned by SexPlayCam.com, SexPlayCam.com may transfer your personally 
identifiable information to a third party as a part of such merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale. In the event the transaction proceeds, we will require that the receiving party 
agree that they will be similarly bound by the provisions of this privacy policy and that they will only use and disclose your personal information as we are similarly entitled under this 
privacy policy. In the event the sale does not proceed, we will require the potential purchaser to not use or disclose your personal information in any manner whatsoever and to completely 
erase the same.</li>

<p>The security of your personal information is a priority to SexPlayCam.com. We are responsible for protecting personal information under our control, including personal information that has 
been transferred to, or received from, a third party.</p> 

<p>Registered User and Member accounts are secured by member-created passwords.  We use reasonable measures to protect registration and membership information that is stored within our
