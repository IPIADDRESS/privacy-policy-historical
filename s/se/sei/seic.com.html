	<b>We recognize the importance of respecting your information and maintaining confidentiality.</b>  As a regulated financial institution, we must obtain information about you. We use this information in a number of ways: giving you authenticated access to your account information; servicing your or your company's account; complying with regulatory requirements; providing you with customized information; and making our applications easier and more useful for you.  
<p class="line_spacing">
We know you may be concerned about what we do with the information you provide us. You have our assurance that we are committed to safeguarding your data and maintaining your privacy online and we do not sell your information to third parties, unless we have your prior written consent or are required by law to provide such information.  We may, however, share selected information under certain conditions as part of normal business operations and/or in respect to servicing your account, such as executing transactions you have placed, and as part of normal legal/regulatory purposes required by the Internal Revenue Service, Securities and Exchange Commission, and other regulatory and government entities.  If applicable, we have ensured that third parties with whom we contract to assist us in providing services for your account have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of your data.  Such service providers will only have access to your data as is necessary and are prohibited from any unlawful use of your data. 
</p><p class="line_spacing">
We periodically also forward to your attention educational information as well as material pertaining to our products and services that might be of interest to you. The Account Access site uses cookies but does not store any personal or company information on the cookie, such as an e-mail address or name. The only piece of information on an Account Access cookie is a random identification number so when you come to Account Access we can recognize who you are from the information stored on the most secure part of our website.  
</p><p class="line_spacing">
We protect your account information from unauthorized access, to the best of our ability, by placing it on the most secure portion of our website. That's why you have to enter a unique user name and password each time you want to access secure applications. Your password should never be shared with anyone. None of our other clients can access your data, and only a restricted set of our employees can access your data in order to provide service to you. 
</p><p class="line_spacing">
When you access password-protected portions of our site using Netscape Navigator® or Microsoft® Internet Explorer, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology is used to protect your communications through server authentication and data encryption. We upgrade and maintain our technology on an on-going basis. The Account Access site does link to some external sites, however, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those websites.
