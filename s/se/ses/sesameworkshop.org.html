</p><p class="normal">
<a name="privacy1"></a></p><p class="white"><a name="privacy1"><b>1. Trust, Notice, and Security</b>
</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy1">
<b>At Sesame Workshop, we fully disclose our policy about the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure, and security of personal information obtained from users of our online activities. By personal information, we mean a name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, or any other information that can be used to contact an individual.</b>
</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy1">
Concerns about privacy can be stronger in the online environment. Sesame Workshop promises to follow this privacy and fair information practices policy that we specially designed for our Web site. Parents can trust Sesame Workshop will not misuse any personal information about their children or about themselves. 

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy1">
Sesame Workshop will change over time as we add exciting new features, services, and options. The Internet itself will also change as new capabilities and perhaps new laws emerge. This policy will be updated occasionally. Our philosophy of protecting user information from inappropriate uses and disclosures will not change. We promise to provide appropriate advance notice through the Web site of any change that materially affects the collection, maintenance, use, or disclosure of personal information from children or adults. We will also seek parental consent should we ever decide to collect and maintain personal information from children. Other changes to this privacy policy statement that reflect refinements, improvements, updates, and new features will be made as appropriate and posted as soon as possible. Whenever the privacy policy changes, we will modify the date and version number to reflect that a change was made.

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy1">
Another important element of trust is security. The security of personal information is a high priority at Sesame Workshop. We maintain this Web site and all associated data with technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, and improper disclosure. We follow industry-proven security procedures such as encrypted administrative communication, restricted access to underlying machines, and firewalls at network access points. No computer system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard. Sesame Workshop is committed to providing reasonable and appropriate security controls to protect our Web site and its information against foreseeable hazards.

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy1">
Sesame Workshop requires that employees and contractors who have access to personal information from the Web site acknowledge in writing that they have read these privacy and fair information practices rules and that they are expected to follow it.

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy1">
This Web site is operated by Sesame Workshop located at One Lincoln Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10023. Our telephone number is 212-595-3456. Our E-mail address is </a><a href="mailto:privacy@@ctwonline.com.">privacy@@ctwonline.com</a>.

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy2">
Sesame Workshop encourages parents and caregivers to spend time online with children and to collaborate in the learning and fun offered at our Web site. The Internet is a wonderful place to explore as a family. We recommend that an adult accompany children when using content on the Internet. 

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy2">
Our Web site has been designed to delight children and adults alike. We offer parental education and online child safety programs for our audience. We encourage parents to take advantage of these programs to teach their children about online safety and to supervise their children online. 

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy2">
Sesame Workshop recognizes that collecting personal information from visitors to our Web site can be sensitive. Many features do not require disclosure of a name, E-mail address, or other personal information. Some features need personal information in order to work. We want our users to understand what information we collect and how we use it. We also want to provide our users with a choice when possible.

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy2">
</a><a name="privacy3"></a></p><p class="white"><a name="privacy3"><b>3. Use and Disclosure Limitations</b>

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy3">
Use Policy: When Sesame Workshop gathers personal information from users, we ask for permission first. We also disclose, at the time of collection, how the information will be used by us. Personal information is used for activities such as site registration, site membership, online sweepstakes that require notification of winners, newsletter subscriptions, and mailings that describe upcoming products, events, and features. 

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy3">
User Choice: Whenever possible, Sesame Workshop allows users to make choices about how their personal information will be used. For example, when you register for the Discussion Board, you are asked if you object to making your E-mail address available to other discussion members. Also, if we plan to use your information for Sesame Workshop marketing or advertising purposes, we let you tell us in advance that you do not want to receive any mail about our activities or promotions or about offers from our sponsors or advertisers. For example, when you register for our newsletter, you are asked if you object to our using the information to contact you about new features and content on our Web site. 

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy3">
Disclosure Policy: We do not normally disclose personal information to anyone outside of Sesame Workshop unless we have previously informed users about the disclosures. However, some data may be used from time to time by outside auditors, consultants, and others hired by Sesame Workshop to assist in carrying out financial or operational activities. We permit these uses only when necessary to manage the Web site and its records or for another specific purpose consistent with this privacy policy. All recipients must agree in writing to safeguard personal information, to use it only for an authorized purpose, and to return it or destroy it upon completion of the activity. 

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy3">
Sesame Workshop might be required to disclose personal information in response to valid legal process. This includes a search warrant, subpoena, or court order. In this respect, we are no different from any other record keeper. Disclosures may also be appropriate to protect the safety of a child, during emergencies if physical safety is believed to be at risk, to protect the security or integrity of our Web site, or to take precautions against liability. We think that these events are unlikely, but they are possible. We will take reasonable steps to limit the scope of any of these disclosures.

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy4">

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy4">
<u><b>Information About Children</b></u>
</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy4">
Sesame Workshop does not collect personal information from children.
 
</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy4">
One of our most popular offerings for children does not require personal information. It is Kid City, and its primary feature is Sticker World. In Sticker World, children provide a nickname and password to create their own Web page and to trade stickers with others. The nicknames and passwords are not connected to personal identifiers. Children using the site are effectively anonymous.

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy4">
Sweepstakes and Contests for Children: We sometimes offer children the opportunity to enter a sweepstakes or contest for a prize through Sticker World or other online activities. Children enter the sweepstakes or contest using screen names only. We do not collect any personal information from children entering sweepstakes and contests.

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy4">
Winners are notified through messages delivered to their mailbox on the Sesame Workshop Web site. Winners under the age of 18 must then obtain parental approval, and parents must sign an Affidavit of Eligibility &amp; Liability/Publicity Release. When necessary to deliver a prize, delivery information about the winner may be shared with a third party.
 
</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy4">
Sesame Street Post Office: The Sesame Street Post Office allows a child or other person to receive an e-mail response from a Muppet. A visitor to the Post Office selects a Muppet and asks a question from a fixed set of questions. The visitor provides only the first name and e-mail address of the recipient of the reply. The Post Office is fully automated. It selects a prewritten answer to the question and e-mails the answer. No other e-mails will be sent to the visitor.
</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy4">    
<u><b>Information About Adults</b></u>

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy4">
Member Center: Sesame Workshop offers free membership for site visitors who are at least 18 years of age. Users who register through the Member Center can join discussion boards, enter sweepstakes, and receive newsletters. To be a Member of the CTW Family Workshop at the Member Center, a user must provide a member "name", password, first name, last name, E-mail address, gender, age, and zip code. Members may optionally provide other demographic information. Once registered, Sesame Workshop Members may update their information at any time. 

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy4">
The optional Member Center information is never revealed to anyone outside Sesame Workshop. Some other information provided by the user may be shared with outside sponsors. If a sweepstakes has an outside sponsor, the E-mail addresses of those who enter the sweepstakes may be shared with the sponsor. Also, some information about subscribers to the Baby Workshop and the Crib Notes newsletter is shared with Baby Workshop sponsors. Details about opting-out of disclosures for sweepstakes and the Baby Workshop can be found later.

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy4">
Discussion Board: Sesame Workshop operates a discussion area for parents to exchange ideas and advice. Discussion Board is for adults. Only Members of the Sesame Workshop can participate, and Members must be age 18 or older. We believe that some of the best information comes from the families that participate on our Web site. These discussions are a valuable addition to the Web site and a great resource for our users. We will occasionally highlight posts from the discussions so that other users can more easily join a specific conversation and can quickly see how intelligent and helpful the Discussion Board can be.

</a></p><p class="normal"><a name="privacy4">
Discussions take place in a public arena. Post information only if you feel comfortable sharing it with others. To keep discussions safe and productive, trained professionals monitor and participate in the Discussion Board daily so that we can be sure that we are maintaining a quality environment. Our policy is to remove posts that include home addresses and telephone numbers. Please do not post this information in the Discussion Board.

Sweepstakes for Adults: We sometimes offer Members the opportunity to enter a sweepstakes for a prize, such as an Elmopalooza home video. Only Members of the Sesame Workshop can participate, and Members must be age 18 or older. Winners are selected at random. They must provide an address so we can send the prize. If a sweepstakes has an outside sponsor, the E-mail addresses of those who entered may be shared with the sponsor. Sweepstakes entrants can opt-out of receiving any unsolicited e-mail from a sponsor. When necessary to deliver a prize, delivery information about the winner of a sweepstakes may be shared with a third party.

Newsletters for Parents: Sesame Workshop offers weekly E-mail newsletters for parents. These include our Sesame Workshop Family Newsletter and our Sesame Street Beat newsletter.

Baby Workshop: The Baby Workshop offers programming and information for new and expectant parents. Visitors become Members of the Baby Workshop by completing a registration form that requires user name, password, E-mail address, first name, last name, due date/age of child, and zip code.

Once registered, Members may update their information at any time.

Baby Workshop and the Crib Notes Newsletter are made possible with support from outside sponsors. Registration information for Baby Workshop Members is shared with the sponsors who may use it in the aggregate to make decisions about how to meet the needs of the members. Sponsors may also use e-mail addresses to send occasional, unsolicited E-mail containing promotional announcements. Members can decline the opportunity to receive this E-mail when they join. Sponsors maintain information in accordance with their own privacy policies. Baby Workshop Members may also receive occasional, unsolicited E-mail describing new Workshop online features, content, or promotional offers. Members can separately decline the opportunity to receive this E-mail when they register. Members can also unsubscribe to the Crib Notes Newsletter at any time.

Parents' Advisory Board: Sesame Workshop operates a wholly voluntary Parents' Advisory Board that any Sesame Workshop Member can join. Members of the Parents' Advisory Board are occasionally asked questions via E-mail about upcoming features we are considering. Input and opinions from users help us build a better site for you and your family. Responses to these questions from Members of the Advisory Board are used only to compile aggregate statistical information about Board Members. Once the answers are analyzed, any link between the answers and personal information is broken forever.
