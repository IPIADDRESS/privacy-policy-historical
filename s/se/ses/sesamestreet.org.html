Privacy and Fair Information Practices Policy<br>
For CTW Family Workshop (ctw.org)<br>
</b></font><p><font color="#cc0000" face="helvetica"><b>
Version 1.4 -- November 25, 1998</b></font>
</p><p>
<b>New Feature On Our Site: CTW Baby Workshop</b>
</p><p>
<i>In March, CTW Family Workshop will be launching the CTW Baby Workshop. Membership will allow users to receive special CTW Baby Workshop Newsletters. The CTW Baby Workshop is made possible with support from exclusive sponsors. Information provided in order to register may be shared only by the CTW Family Workshop (including CTW Baby Workshop) and our sponsors. Newsletter subscribers may receive occasional, unsolicited E-mail from the CTW Baby Workshop and from our exclusive sponsors describing new online features and content or promotional offers.  All subscribers to all CTW Baby Workshop Newsletters can decline the opportunity to receive such E-mail when they register. Subscribers can also unsubscribe to any or all CTW Baby Workshop Newsletters.  </i>
</p><p>
<br>
<br>
Children's Television Workshop has been trusted by parents for more than thirty years to provide safe, entertaining, and reliable products and content.  We take this trust very seriously, especially as we expand our online presence.  We recognize that families are concerned about privacy and especially about the privacy of their children online.  CTW Family Workshop, its staff, contractors, and others who help us operate our Web site follow this policy on privacy and fair information practices for online activities of CTW Online.
</p><p>
<font color="#cc0000" face="helvetica"><b>1. Trust, Notice, and Security</b></font>
</p><p>
<b>At CTW Family Workshop, we fully disclose our policy about the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure, and security of personally identifiable information obtained from users of our online activities.</b>
</p><p>
Concerns about privacy can be stronger in the online environment.  CTW Family Workshop promises to follow this privacy and fair information practices policy that we specially designed for our Web site.  Parents can trust CTW Family Workshop to do the right thing with personal information about themselves and their children. 
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop will change over time as we add exciting new features, services, and options.  The Internet itself will also change as new capabilities and perhaps new laws emerge.  This policy may also need to be updated occasionally.  We do not anticipate that our philosophy of protecting user information from inappropriate uses and disclosures will change.  However, this policy statement will be refined, improved, and updated to reflect refinements, improvements, and changes in our Web site.
</p><p>
When this privacy and fair information practices policy statement changes, we will post the new statement on the CTW Family Workshop Web site 30 days before it becomes effective.  The <i>privacy link</i> that appears at the bottom of our home page and elsewhere on the Web site will signal a change in this policy statement.  In the future, we plan to offer the opportunity for notice by E-mail of any planned policy changes.
</p><p>
Another important element of trust is security.  The security of personal information is a high priority at CTW Family Workshop.  We maintain this Web site and all associated data with technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, and improper disclosure.  No computer system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard.  CTW Family Workshop is committed to providing reasonable and appropriate security controls to protect our Web site and its information against foreseeable hazards.  
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop requires that employees and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information from the Web site acknowledge in writing that they have read these privacy and fair information practices rules and that they are expected to follow it.  Any employee or contractor who fails to comply with these rules will be disciplined or fired.
</p><p>
<font color="#cc0000" face="helvetica"><b>2. Parental Involvement and Consent</b></font>
</p><p>
<b>Parental involvement in a child's CTW Family Workshop activities is a cornerstone of our approach to the Internet.  We will require prior parental consent before we collect personal information from children under the age of 13.  We limit the amount of information that we do collect even with that consent.</b>
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop encourages parents and caregivers to spend time online with children and to collaborate in the learning and fun offered at our Web site.  The Internet is a wonderful place to explore as a family.  We recommend that an adult accompany children when using content on the Internet.
</p><p>
Our Web site has been designed to delight children and adults alike.  We offer parental education and online child safety programs for our audience.  We encourage parents to take advantage of these programs to teach their children about online safety and to supervise their children online.
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop recognizes that collecting personal information from visitors to our Web site can be sensitive.  Many features of our Web site do not require disclosure of a name, E-mail address, or any other personal information.  Some features need personal information in order to work.  We want our users to understand what information we collect and how we use it.  We also want to provide our users with a choice when possible.  
</p><p>
Children under the age of 13 may not understand the consequences of giving out personally identifiable information to others.  CTW Family Workshop requires prior parental consent before these children may directly provide personal information on our Web site.  Since our Web site does not currently seek personal information from children, we have not implemented a parental consent process. 
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop collects some information from parents:  
</p><p>
<b>Newsletter</b>:  CTW Family Workshop offers a bi-weekly E-mail newsletter for parents.  We ask those who register for the newsletter to provide their name, E-mail address, gender, age, number of children in the household, ages of the children, and five-digit zipcode.  This information is not shared with third parties.  Newsletter subscribers may receive occasional, unsolicited E-mail from CTW Family Workshop describing new online features and content or promotional offers.  All subscribers can decline the opportunity to receive this E-mail when they register.  Subscribers can also unsubscribe to the newsletter.
</p><p>
<b>Discussion Board</b>:  CTW Family Workshop operates a discussion area for parents to exchange ideas and advice with each other.  We believe that some of the best information comes from the families who participate on our Web site.  These discussions are a valuable addition to the Web site and a great resource for our members.  We ask that all participants be age 18 or older.  We will occasionally highlight posts from the discussions so that other users can more easily join a specific conversation and can quickly see how intelligent and helpful the Discussion Board can be.  
</p><p>
Discussions take place in a public arena.  You should only post information that you feel comfortable sharing with others.  In order to keep discussions safe and productive, trained professionals monitor and participate in the Discussion Board daily so that we can be sure that we are maintaining a quality environment.  Our policy is to remove posts that include home addresses and telephone numbers.  Please do not post this information in the Discussion Board.  Also, only post your e-mail address if you would like other participants to contact you directly.
</p><p>
The registration process for the discussion board asks for name, E-mail address, and for a user selected <i>username</i> and password.  Parents can also publicly post a user profile with whatever biographical information they care to include.  The user profile is voluntary.
</p><p>
<b>Sweepstakes</b>:  We sometime offer Web site visitors the opportunity to enter a sweepstakes for a prize, such as an Elmopalooza home video.  The contests are open to adults (18 or older), and children are told to get their parents to enter.  Winners are selected at random.  Those who enter are asked to provide their E-mail address and a postal mailing address.  The addresses are needed to notify the winners and to send the prizes.  Neither address is shared with third parties.  The postal mailing address may be used occasionally by CTW Family Workshop to send promotional materials, and each entrant will have an opportunity to decline to receive mail.
</p><p>
<font color="#cc0000" face="helvetica"><b>3. Use and Disclosure Limitations</b></font>
</p><p>
<b>CTW Family Workshop uses personally identifiable information about its Web site users, including children and adults, only in defined and responsible ways.  We do not share user information with third parties.  Disclosures outside the CTW family are only done with parental consent or when required by law.</b>
</p><p>
<b>Use Policy</b>: When CTW Family Workshop gathers personal information from users, we ask for permission first.  We also disclose at the time of collection how the information will be used by us.  Personal information is used for activities such as site registration, participation in online sweepstakes that require notification of winners, newsletter subscriptions, and mailings that describe upcoming products, events, and features.
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop collects information to support monitoring traffic on our Web site and general usage trends.  This enables us to know, for example, how often pages are visited and which features are most popular.  We do not retain usage information collected this way on an individually identifiable basis.  We compile the information and use it only in the aggregate.  We use non-identifiable and aggregate information only for statistical and similar purposes, and we <i>never</i> try to use non-identifiable information to identify the individual who provided it.
</p><p>
<b>Cookies</b>: On the Internet, a cookie is a piece of information that a Web site transfers to a user's computer for record-keeping purposes.  As a user moves from page to page at the CTW Family Workshop Web site, a cookie is the only way that we have of knowing who you are.  An activity on one page may depend on what you selected on a previous page.  We use a cookie to keep track of your selection.  Without cookies, users may be asked to provide the same information repeatedly.  Some activities may not function at all.
</p><p>
The use of cookies is common on the Internet.  Most major Web sites use cookies.  CTW Family Workshop uses cookies only when appropriate.  We <i>never</i> use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie from us.  We <i>never</i> use information transferred through cookies for marketing purposes.  We <i>never</i> share cookies information with any third parties for marketing or other purposes.
</p><p>
You may occasionally get cookies directly from Web sites operated by our advertisers.  CTW Family Workshop does not see or use these cookies.  Advertisers are not covered by our cookies policy.  When you leave our Web site, we tell you that you are leaving so that you know that our policy no longer apply.  All of our advertisers have their own privacy policy.
</p><p>
You can control cookies from your end.  Internet browsers (like Netscape and Explorer) give you the ability to control the use of cookies.  Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.  If you prefer, you can set your browser to alert you when cookies are in use.  You may set your browser to disable or refuse cookies.  You can also erase a cookie that has been placed on your computer by us or by others.  If you do not allow cookies to be used in the traditional way, it is possible that some parts of the Web site, like the Discussion Board, will not function as we designed them.  It is your choice.
</p><p>
<b>User Choice</b>: Whenever possible, CTW Family Workshop allows users to make choices about how their personal information will be used.  For example, when you register for the Discussion Board, you are asked if you object to making your E-mail address available to other discussion members.  Also, if we plan to use your information for CTW Family Workshop marketing or advertising purposes, we let you tell us in advance that you do not want to receive any mail about our activities or promotions or about offers from our sponsors or advertisers.  For example, when you register for our newsletter, you are asked if you object to our using the information to contact you about new features and content on our Web site.
</p><p>
<b>Disclosure</b>: We do not normally disclose any personal information to anyone outside of CTW Family Workshop without the express consent of parents.  However, some data may be used from time to time by outside auditors, consultants, and others hired by CTW Family Workshop to assist in carrying out financial or operational activities.  We permit these uses only when necessary to manage the Web site and its records or for another specific purpose consistent with this privacy policy.  All recipients must agree in writing to safeguard personal information, to use it only for an authorized purpose, and to return it or destroy it upon completion of the activity.  
</p><p>
It is possible that CTW Family Workshop could be required to disclose personal information in response to valid legal process.  This includes a search warrant, subpoena or court order.  In this respect, we are no different from any other record keeper.  Disclosures may also be appropriate to protect CTW Family Workshop's legal rights or during emergencies if physical safety is believed to be at risk.  We think that these events are unlikely, but they are possible.  We will take reasonable steps to limit the scope and consequences of any of these disclosures.
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop does not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose any personal information to advertisers or affiliates.  If an advertiser wants to send you E-mail and if you have not objected to receiving promotions, we send the E-mail message on behalf of the advertiser.  We do not disclose your information to the advertiser.  If you leave our Web site and respond directly to an advertiser and provide personal information, then the advertiser may use that information in accordance with its own policy.  CTW Family Workshop only does business with responsible companies, but we cannot control the way that someone else uses information that you disclose directly to them.
</p><p>
<font color="#cc0000" face="helvetica"><b>4. Data Quality </b></font>
</p><p>
<b>CTW Family Workshop is committed to maintaining accurate, timely, relevant, and appropriate information about our users.  </b>
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop's commitment to data quality includes the recognition that we bear responsibility for maintaining accurate, timely, relevant, and appropriate information about our users.  We cannot serve users properly with inaccurate data.
</p><p>
We also recognize that we may need the assistance of our users to make sure that their information is correct.  Users are the source of the information that we maintain.  Users should have the right to review the information that CTW Family Workshop maintains about them and the right to correct that information if it is wrong.  We are in the process of developing a simple and easy-to-use method of allowing users to exercise access and correction rights.  It will be several months before we are ready to announce how users can review their own information though a single screen.
</p><p>
In the meantime, users can change information that they have given us.  For example, if you have provided a Member Profile, you can change it.  You can also remove it entirely by simply eliminating all of the information on your profile.  You can also unregister for our newsletter and then register again using updated information.  When our new access procedure is available, it will be even easier to review and change your information.  We will include a link here to the new access and correction process when it is available.
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop provides links to other Web sites, and we review the appropriateness of these Web sites for our users.  We also carefully screen our sponsors and advertisers.  They must meet stringent requirements for products, content and advertising.  Each sponsor and advertiser has its own privacy policy, which we encourage you to review.  If you think that any of these Web sites are inappropriate, please contact our CTW Family Workshop Neighborhood Watch program by E-mailing us at <a href="mailto:watch@ctwonline.com">watch@ctwonline.com</a>.
</p><p>
<font color="#cc0000" face="helvetica"><b>5. Complaints</b></font>
</p><p>
<b>CTW Family Workshop pledges to work with users to resolve any complaints about our privacy and fair information practices policy or our implementation of the policy.</b>
</p><p>
This is another area where developments are in process.  We plan to have a formal complaint mechanism, including an online process for accepting and considering complaints about our privacy policy and practices.  In the meantime, if you have a complaint, you can send E-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@ctwonline.com">privacy@ctwonline.com</a>.

<font color="#cc0000" face="helvetica"><b>Children's Television Workshop Online<br>
Privacy and Fair Information Practices Policy<br>
for CTW Family Workshop (ctw.org)<br>
</b></font><p><font color="#cc0000" face="helvetica"><b>
Version 1.6 — February 2, 1999</b></font>
</p><p>
Children's Television Workshop has been trusted by parents for more than thirty years to provide safe, entertaining, and reliable products and content.  We take this trust very seriously, especially as we expand our online presence.  We recognize that families are concerned about privacy and especially about the privacy of their children online.  CTW Family Workshop, its staff, contractors, and others who help us operate our Web site follow this policy on privacy and fair information practices for online activities of CTW Online.
</p><p>
<font color="#cc0000" face="helvetica"><b>1. Trust, Notice, and Security</b></font>
</p><p>
<b>At CTW Family Workshop, we fully disclose our policy about the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure, and security of personally identifiable information obtained from users of our online activities.</b>
</p><p>
Concerns about privacy can be stronger in the online environment.  CTW Family Workshop promises to follow this privacy and fair information practices policy that we specially designed for our Web site.  Parents can trust CTW Family Workshop to do the right thing with personal information about themselves and their children. 
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop will change over time as we add exciting new features, services, and options.  The Internet itself will also change as new capabilities and perhaps new laws emerge.  This policy may also need to be updated occasionally.  We do not anticipate that our philosophy of protecting user information from inappropriate uses and disclosures will change.  However, this policy statement will be refined, improved, and updated to reflect refinements, improvements, and changes in our Web site.
</p><p>
When this privacy and fair information practices policy statement changes, we will, WHENEVER POSSIBLE, post the new statement on the CTW Family Workshop Web site 30 days before it becomes effective.  The privacy link that appears at the bottom of our home page and elsewhere on the Web site will signal a change in this policy statement.  In the future, we plan to offer the opportunity for notice by E-mail of any policy changes.
</p><p>
Another important element of trust is security.  The security of personal information is a high priority at CTW Family Workshop.  We maintain this Web site and all associated data with technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, and improper disclosure.  No computer system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard.  CTW Family Workshop is committed to providing reasonable and appropriate security controls to protect our Web site and its information against foreseeable hazards.  
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop requires that employees and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information from the Web site acknowledge in writing that they have read these privacy and fair information practices rules and that they are expected to follow it.  Any employee or contractor who fails to comply with these rules will be disciplined or fired.
</p><p>
<font color="#cc0000" face="helvetica"><b>2. Parental Involvement and Consent</b></font>
</p><p>
<b>Parental involvement in a child's CTW Family Workshop activities is a cornerstone of our approach to the Internet.  We will require prior parental consent before we collect personal information from children under the age of 13.  We limit the amount of information that we do collect even with that consent.</b>
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop encourages parents and caregivers to spend time online with children and to collaborate in the learning and fun offered at our Web site.  The Internet is a wonderful place to explore as a family.  We recommend that an adult accompany children when using content on the Internet.
</p><p>
Our Web site has been designed to delight children and adults alike.  We offer parental education and online child safety programs for our audience.  We encourage parents to take advantage of these programs to teach their children about online safety and to supervise their children online.
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop recognizes that collecting personal information from visitors to our Web site can be sensitive.  Many features of our Web site do not require disclosure of a name, E-mail address, or any other personal information.  Some features need personal information in order to work.  We want our users to understand what information we collect and how we use it.  We also want to provide our users with a choice when possible.  
</p><p>
The CTW Family Workshop does not currently seek personal information from children.  Children under the age of 13 may not understand the consequences of giving out personally identifiable information to others.  CTW Family Workshop requires prior parental consent before these children may directly provide personal information on our Web site.  Since our Web site does not currently seek personal information from children, we have not implemented a parental consent process. 
</p><p>
Our newest offering is Kid City, and its primary feature is Sticker World.  We do not collect personally identifiable information from children on Kid City.  In Sticker World, children provide a nickname and password to create their own web page and to trade stickers with others.  The nicknames and passwords are not connected to personal identifiers.  Children using the site are effectively anonymous.   
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop collects some information from parents:  
</p><p>
<b>Newsletter</b>:  CTW Family Workshop offers a weekly E-mail newsletter for parents.  We ask those who register for the newsletter to provide their name, E-mail address, gender, age, number of children in the household, ages of the children, and five-digit zip code.  This information is not shared with third parties.  Newsletter subscribers may receive occasional, unsolicited E-mail from CTW Family Workshop describing new online features and content or promotional offers.  All subscribers can decline the opportunity to receive this E-mail when they register.  Subscribers can also unsubscribe to the newsletter.
</p><p>
<b>Baby Workshop</b>:  In the spring of 1999, CTW Family Workshop will launch the Baby Workshop.  Membership in the Workshop allows users to receive the free monthly Crib Notes Newsletters.  The Baby Workshop is made possible with support from exclusive sponsors.  Registration information is shared by the CTW Family Workshop (including Baby Workshop) only with our sponsors.  Newsletter subscribers will receive occasional, unsolicited E-mail from the CTW Baby Workshop and from our exclusive sponsors describing new online features and content or promotional offers.  Subscribers to all CTW Baby Workshop Newsletters can decline the opportunity to receive this E-mail at registration.  Subscribers can also unsubscribe to the Crib Notes Newsletters at any time.
</p><p>
<b>Discussion Board</b>:  CTW Family Workshop operates a discussion area for parents to exchange ideas and advice with each other.  We believe that some of the best information comes from the families that participate on our Web site.  These discussions are a valuable addition to the Web site and a great resource for our members.  We ask that all participants be age 18 or older.  We will occasionally highlight posts from the discussions so that other users can more easily join a specific conversation and can quickly see how intelligent and helpful the Discussion Board can be.  
</p><p>
Discussions take place in a public arena.  You should only post information that you feel comfortable sharing with others.  In order to keep discussions safe and productive, trained professionals monitor and participate in the Discussion Board daily so that we can be sure that we are maintaining a quality environment.  Our policy is to remove posts that include home addresses and telephone numbers.  Please do not post this information in the Discussion Board.  Also, only post your e-mail address if you would like other participants to contact you directly.
</p><p>
The registration process for the Discussion Board asks for name, E-mail address, and a user selected <i>username</i> and password.  Parents can also publicly post a user profile with whatever biographical information they care to include.  The user profile is voluntary.
</p><p>
<b>Sweepstakes</b>:  We sometime offer Web site visitors the opportunity to enter a sweepstakes for a prize, such as an Elmopalooza home video.  The contests are open to adults (18 or older), and children are instructed to ask their parents to enter.  Winners are selected at random.  Those who enter are asked to provide their E-mail address and a postal mailing address.  The addresses are needed to notify the winners and to send the prizes.  Neither address is shared with third parties.  The postal mailing address may be used occasionally by CTW Family Workshop to send promotional materials, and each entrant will have an opportunity to decline to receive mail.
</p><p>
<font color="#cc0000" face="helvetica"><b>3. Use and Disclosure Limitations</b></font>
</p><p>
<b>CTW Family Workshop uses personally identifiable information about its Web site users, including children and adults, only in defined and responsible ways.  We do not share user information with third parties.  Disclosures outside the CTW family are only done with parental consent or when required by law.</b>
</p><p>
<b>Use Policy</b>: When CTW Family Workshop gathers personal information from users, we ask for permission first.  We also disclose at the time of collection how the information will be used by us.  Personal information is used for activities such as site registration, participation in online sweepstakes that require notification of winners, newsletter subscriptions, and mailings that describe upcoming products, events, and features.
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop collects information to support monitoring traffic on our Web site and general usage trends.  This enables us to know, for example, how often pages are visited and which features are most popular.  We do not retain usage information collected this way on an individually identifiable basis.  We compile the information and use it only in the aggregate.  We use nonidentifiable and aggregate information only for statistical and similar purposes, and we <i>never</i> try to use nonidentifiable information to identify the individual who provided it.
</p><p>
<b>Cookies</b>: On the Internet, a cookie is a piece of information that a Web site transfers to a user's computer for record-keeping purposes.  As a user moves from page to page at the CTW Family Workshop Web site, a cookie is the only way that we have of knowing who you are.  An activity on one page may depend on what you selected on a previous page.  We use a cookie to keep track of your selection.  Without cookies, users may be asked to provide the same information repeatedly.  Some activities may not function at all.
</p><p>
The use of cookies is common on the Internet.  Most major Web sites use cookies.  CTW Family Workshop uses cookies only when appropriate.  We <i>never</i> use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie from us.  We <i>never</i> use information transferred through cookies for marketing purposes.  We <i>never</i> share cookies information with any third parties for marketing or other purposes.
</p><p>
Ads on the CTW Family Workshop (e.g., interactive banners) sometimes allow a user to click through to a Web site maintained by an advertiser.  CTW only supports links to a third party site that meets our standards of appropriateness, that complies with AAA and CARU guidelines, and that posts an online privacy policy (although that privacy policy may differ from ours).  When you click through to these Web sites operated by our advertisers, you may occasionally get cookies directly from them.  CTW Family Workshop does not see or use these cookies, and we do not control how other sites use cookies.  Other Web sites operate under their own cookies and privacy policies, and the CTW policies no longer apply once you leave our site.
</p><p>
You can control cookies from your end.  Internet browsers (like Netscape and Explorer) give you the ability to control the use of cookies.  Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.  If you prefer, you can set your browser to alert you when cookies are in use.  You may set your browser to disable or refuse cookies.  You can also erase a cookie that has been placed on your computer by us or by others.  If you do not allow cookies to be used in the traditional way, it is possible that some parts of the Web site, like the Discussion Board, will not function as we designed them.  It is your choice.
</p><p>
<b>User Choice</b>: Whenever possible, CTW Family Workshop allows users to make choices about how their personal information will be used.  For example, when you register for the Discussion Board, you are asked if you object to making your E-mail address available to other discussion members.  Also, if we plan to use your information for CTW Family Workshop marketing or advertising purposes, we let you tell us in advance that you do not want to receive any mail about our activities or promotions or about offers from our sponsors or advertisers.  For example, when you register for our newsletter, you are asked if you object to our using the information to contact you about new features and content on our Web site.
</p><p>
<b>Disclosure</b>: We do not normally disclose any personal information to anyone outside of CTW Family Workshop without the express consent of parents.  However, some data may be used from time to time by outside auditors, consultants, and others hired by CTW Family Workshop to assist in carrying out financial or operational activities.  We permit these uses only when necessary to manage the Web site and its records or for another specific purpose consistent with this privacy policy.  All recipients must agree in writing to safeguard personal information, to use it only for an authorized purpose, and to return it or destroy it upon completion of the activity.  
</p><p>
It is possible that CTW Family Workshop could be required to disclose personal information in response to valid legal process.  This includes a search warrant, subpoena or court order.  In this respect, we are no different from any other record keeper.  Disclosures may also be appropriate to protect CTW Family Workshop's legal rights or during emergencies if physical safety is believed to be at risk.  We think that these events are unlikely, but they are possible.  We will take reasonable steps to limit the scope and consequences of any of these disclosures.
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop does not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose any personal information to advertisers or affiliates.  If an advertiser wants to send you E-mail and if you have not objected to receiving promotions, we send the E-mail message on behalf of the advertiser.  We do not disclose your information to the advertiser.  If you leave our Web site and respond directly to an advertiser and provide personal information, then the advertiser may use that information in accordance with its own policy.  CTW Family Workshop only does business with responsible companies, but we cannot control the way that someone else uses information that you disclose directly to them.
</p><p>
<font color="#cc0000" face="helvetica"><b>4. Data Quality </b></font>
</p><p>
<b>CTW Family Workshop is committed to maintaining accurate, timely, relevant, and appropriate information about our users.  </b>
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop's commitment to data quality includes the recognition that we bear responsibility for maintaining accurate, timely, relevant, and appropriate information about our users.  We cannot serve users properly with inaccurate data.
</p><p>
We also recognize that we may need the assistance of our users to make sure that their information is correct.  Users are the source of the information that we maintain.  Users should have the right to review the information that CTW Family Workshop maintains about them and the right to correct that information if it is wrong.  We are in the process of developing a simple and easy-to-use method of allowing users to exercise access and correction rights.  It will be several months before we are ready to announce how users can review their own information through a single screen.
</p><p>
In the meantime, users can change information that they have given us.  For example, if you have provided a Member Profile, you can change it.  You can also remove it entirely by simply eliminating all of the information on your profile.  You can also unregister for our newsletter and then register again using updated information.  When our new access procedure is available, it will be even easier to review and change your information.  We will include a link here to the new access and correction process when it is available.
</p><p>
CTW Family Workshop provides links to other Web sites, and we review the appropriateness of these Web sites for our users.  We also carefully screen our sponsors and advertisers.  They must meet stringent requirements for products, content and advertising.  Each sponsor and advertiser has its own privacy policy, which we encourage you to review.  If you think that any of these Web sites are inappropriate, please contact our CTW Family Workshop Neighborhood Watch program by E-mailing us at <a href="mailto:watch@ctwonline.com">watch@ctwonline.com</a>.
</p><p>
<font color="#cc0000" face="helvetica"><b>5. Complaints</b></font>
</p><p>
<b>CTW Family Workshop pledges to work with users to resolve any complaints about our privacy and fair information practices policy or our implementation of the policy.</b>
</p><p>
This is another area where developments are in process.  We plan to have a formal complaint mechanism, including an online process for accepting and considering complaints about our privacy policy and practices.  In the meantime, if you have a complaint, you can send E-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@ctwonline.com">privacy@ctwonline.com</a>.
