This type of data collection is common throughout most websites, and in no way impinges on your privacy.

	<li>Other businesses with which we partner or which we carefully select to offer you products, services, and promotions through our website or offline; and</li>
	<li>Other third parties in limited circumstances, such as complying with legal requirements, preventing fraud, and protecting the safety of our users.</li>
</ol>
