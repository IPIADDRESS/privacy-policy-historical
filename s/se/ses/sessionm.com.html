<p>Welcome and thank you for visiting the SessionM website (“<strong>Site</strong>”). SessionM offers a hosted software as a service platform to brands that have contracted with SessionM for consumer data orchestration and engagement (“<strong>Brands</strong>”). Brands include our partners or resellers that offer our Services in connection or combination with services they provide to their customers, most often through their mobile Brand Applications (defined below).&nbsp;SessionM helps Brands understand their consumers and provide their consumers with personalized offers, campaigns, and loyalty programs. Our platform includes tools for creating audience “segments” based on information about consumers (for example, segments based on age, gender, location, transaction and website or mobile application interaction history). These tools enable Brands to send relevant communications and promotions to certain audience “segments” via email, SMS, push notifications and in-app messaging. Using the tools, Brands can also generate reports on audience segments, create and run surveys, configure and manage loyalty programs, and offer and manage promotions and rewards.</p>
<p>In this Privacy Policy we refer to the SessionM platform and applications as our “Services”. The Brand’s services are referred to as “Brand Applications”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong name="scope">Scope</strong></p>
