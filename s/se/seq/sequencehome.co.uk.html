 <a href="#" name="CookiesInfo" style="color: #525252; text-decoration: none">3.9 Our use of Cookies</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
 3.9.1 A cookie is a small piece of information that a site puts on your hard disk or stores in your computer's memory so that it can remember something about you at a later time. It is a mechanism that allows the server to store its own information about a user on the user's own computer. This is because each request for a web page is independent of all other requests, so the web page server has no memory of what pages it has shown you or anything about your previous visits.
