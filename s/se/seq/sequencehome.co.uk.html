<p>3.9 Our use of Cookies&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">3.9.1 A cookie is a small piece of information that a site puts on your hard disk or stores in your computer's memory so that it can remember something about you at a later time. It is a mechanism that allows the server to store its own information about a user on the user's own computer. This is because each request for a web page is independent of all other requests, so the web page server has no memory of what pages it has shown you or anything about your previous visits. A cookie records your preferences when using a particular site, ensuring that you are not shown the same information and/or are only shown information you have stated that you are interested in. In order to use the Site you agree to let cookies be saved as they are an important part of navigation of the Site.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">3.9.2 We or our third party advertisers may also use cookies to monitor the effectiveness of advertising on the Site.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">3.9.3 Cookies used by this site.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">A cookie is used to store your preferences for viewing search results and may contain a unique identifier so that our servers can temporarily record what search terms you used.<br>
We also use the cookie to allow you to log into the MyAccount part of the site, this will store some personal information (First Name, Last Name, Email Address, Home Phone Number) that may be used should you need to fill out an enquiry form. This information is removed when you log out of MyAccount or when your session expires.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">3.9.4 Third party cookies used on the site.</p>
