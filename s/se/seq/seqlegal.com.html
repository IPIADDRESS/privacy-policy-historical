			<h4>(1) Introduction</h4>
				
				<p>This website is owned and operated by SEQ Legal LLP.</p>	
				
				<p>We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors;

				<p>We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal information:</p>
				
				<p>(a) information about your computer and about your visits to and use of our websites (which may include 
				your IP address, geographical location, browser type and version, referral source, entry page, exit page, 
				length of visit, number of page views, route taken through our website, and similar information);</p>

				<p>(b)	information relating to any enquiries you make concerning our template documents or purchases you make of our template documents (which 
				may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, company name, role/position, payment details and details of the proposed use or 
				uses of the template documents);</p>

				<p>(c)	information relating to or supplied to us in connection with any legal services we may provide to you;</p>
				
				<p>(d)	information that you provide to us for the purpose of registering with our website blogs (your name and email address);</p>
				
				<p>(e)	information that you provide to us for the purpose of subscribing to our email notifications 
				and/or newsletters (your name, email address and areas of interest); and</p>

				<p>(f)	any other information that you choose to send to us.</p>	
				
			
			<h4>(3)	Using your personal data</h4>

				<p>We may use your personal information to:</p>

				<p>(a)	administer the website;</p>

				<p>(b)	improve your browsing experience by personalising the website;</p>

				<p>(c)	enable your use of the services available on the website;</p>

				<p>(d)	send to you templates that you purchase, and supply to you services we contract to provide;</p>

				<p>(e)	send statements and invoices to you, and collect payments from you;</p>

				<p>(f)	send you general (non-marketing) commercial communications;</p>

				<p>(g)	send you email notifications which you have specifically requested;</p>

				<p>(h)	send to you our newsletter and other marketing communications relating to our business 
				or the businesses of carefully-selected third parties which we think may be of interest to you by 
				post or, where you have specifically agreed to this, by email or similar technology (you can inform
				 us at any time if you no longer require marketing communications);</p>

				<p>(i)	provide third parties with statistical information about our users (but this information will not be used to identify any individual user); and</p>

				<p>(j)	deal with enquiries and complaints made by or about you relating to the website.</p>

				<p>Where you submit personal information for publication on our website, we will publish and 
				otherwise use that information in accordance with the license you grant to us.</p>
										
			<h4>(4) Disclosures</h4>

				<p>We may disclose information about you to any of our employees, officers, agents, 
				suppliers or subcontractors insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes as 
				set out in this privacy policy.</p>

				<p>In addition, we may disclose information about you:</p>

				<p>(a) to the extent that we are required to do so by law;</p>

				<p>(b) in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings;</p>

				<p>(c) in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information 
				to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk); and </p>

				<p>(d) to the purchaser (or prospective purchaser) of any business or 
				asset which we are (or are contemplating) selling.</p>

			<h4>(5)	Cookies</h4>
				
				<p>A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. 
				The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. 
				This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. </p>

				<p>We use session cookies on the website.  We will use the session cookies to keep track of you whilst 
				you navigate the website. Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser.</p>
				
				<p>We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website.  Google Analytics generates statistical and
				other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers.  The 
				information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. 
				Google will store this information.  Google's privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html.</p>

				<p>Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third party 
				cookies.  For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking Tools, Internet Options, 
				Privacy, and selecting Block All Cookies using the sliding selector.  Blocking all cookies will, 
				however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites.</p>				
	
			<h4>(6)	Your rights</h4>

				<p>You may instruct us to provide you with any personal information we hold about you.  Provision of such information may be subject to 
				the payment of a fee (currently fixed at GBP 10.00).</p>

				<p>You may instruct us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes (by email or otherwise) at any time.  (In practice, you will usually 
				either expressly agree in advance to our use of your personal data for marketing purposes, or we will provide you with an 
				opportunity to opt-out of the use of your personal data for marketing purposes.)</p>
	
	
			<h4>(7)	Security of your personal data</h4>

				<p>We will take reasonable precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your 
				personal information. Of course, data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure, 
				and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.</p>

				
				
			<h4>(8)	International data transfers</h4>

				<p>Information that we collect may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the 
				countries in which we operate in order to enable us to use the information in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

				<p>Information which you provide may be transferred to countries which do not have data 
				protection laws equivalent to those in force in the European Economic Area.</p>

				<p>In addition, personal information that you submit for publication on the website will be published on the internet
				and may be available, via the internet, around the world.</p>

				<p>You expressly agree to such transfers of personal information.</p>
				
				
			<h4>(9) Policy amendments</h4>

				<p>We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time by posting a new version 
				on our website. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy 
				with any changes.</p>

			<h4>(10) Third party websites</h4>

				<p>The website contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the 
				privacy policies or practices of those websites.</p>
