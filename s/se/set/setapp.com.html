            You can remove your Personal Data from Setapp at any time by emailing us with the respective request: <a href="mailto:support@setapp.com">support@setapp.com</a>. However, we may keep some of your Personal Data

            Non-sensitive details (your email address etc.) are sent normally over the Internet, and this can never be

            Once we receive your data, we protect it on our servers using a combination of technical, physical, and

                Have your Personal Data corrected or deleted. You may ask us to correct information you think is

                interest, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of a
                legal claims.

                consent, and you may withdraw your consent at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link found within
