<p><strong>1. <u>INFORMATION  COVERED BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY</u></strong><br>
  <em>Information You Provide</em><br>
  We may collect personal data, including  your name, email or street address, date of  birth, telephone number, your preferences and interests, or other information  you provide to us or grant us access to (“<strong>Personal  Data/Information</strong>”) when you register for newsletters, communicate with us,  or take part in interactive games, features or competitions. We may also  collect any photographs, video images or other user-generated content that you  may upload to the Site (“<strong>User-Generated  Content” or “UGC”</strong>). The Sites may also ask you to provide other  information about yourself, such as demographic information (gender, zip code,  age, etc.) or certain information about your preferences and interests. If we  combine demographic or other information we collect about you with Personal  Information about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal  Information. Please note that information submitted to the Sites via a  "contact us" or other similar function may not receive a response. We  will not use the information provided to contact you for marketing purposes  unrelated to your request unless you agree otherwise.<br>
  <u>Information We Collect  Automatically As You Access and Use the Sites</u><br>
  Whenever you visit or interact with the Sites or  MSM content, MSM, as well as any third-party advertisers, content providers  and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically  or passively collect information about how the Sites are accessed and used  ("<strong>Usage Information</strong>"). Usage Information may include, in part,  browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, and the preceding  page &amp; video views. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if  MSM associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, MSM treats it  as Personal Information.<br>
  MSM also automatically collects your IP address or  other unique identifier ("<strong>Device Identifier</strong>") for the  computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, "<strong>Device</strong>")  you use to access the Sites. A Device Identifier is a number that is  automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its  servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some  mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service  providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used  to access the Sites.<br>
  The technologies  used on the Sites to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers,  include:<strong></strong></p>
<a name="3"></a>
<p><strong><em>Cookies  and Other Tracking Technologies </em></strong></p>
<p>By using the Site,  you consent to our cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it  is used to visit the Sites. A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device  via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-into or downloaded by you to your  Device. Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for many purposes, including,  without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your  visits to our web pages. If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your  Device, some features of the Sites may not function properly. The use  of cookies on the Site allows you to enjoy more seamless visits and more  accurately measures your behaviour on the Site. There are two types of cookies  that we may use: session and persistent. Session cookies exist only during an  online session. They disappear from your Device when you close the browser  software. Persistent cookies remain on your Device after the browser has been  closed. The cookies used on the Site do not identify you personally. They  merely recognize your browser, unless you choose to identify yourself  voluntarily. You may choose to identify yourself for any one of the following  reasons: by asking the browser to remember your username and password, by  responding to a promotional offer, or by personalizing a web page or requesting  more information on a product or service.</p>
<p><strong>Web  beacons</strong> (also known as clear gifs) are used in combination with cookies  to help Site operators understand how you interact with their websites. A web  beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel)  that is placed on a site or in an email. The use of a clear gif allows the Site  to measure your actions in opening the page that contains the clear gif.<br>
  <strong><em>Embedded Scripts.</em></strong> An embedded script is programming code that is  designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites, such as  the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device  from our server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are  connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. <br>
  <strong><em>Log  File Information</em></strong><br>
  Our web servers automatically collect limited  information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP  address, when you visit our site. Your IP address is a number that lets  computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the  web pages you view. Your IP address does not identify you personally </p>
<p><em>How  We Use Cookies and Web Beacons</em><br>
  MSM may use  cookies and web beacons for a number of purposes, including to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide general internal and customer analytics.</li>
  <li>Study traffic patterns in order to improve website  performance, to customize the user experience, and to better match the users’  interests and preferences. For example, MSM keeps track of the domains from  which people visit, and also measures visitor activity on MSM websites.  However, these tracking records are performed and maintained in ways that keep  the data non-identifiable.</li>
  <li>Keep track of preferences you specify while you are  using MSM products or services.</li>
  <li>Support security measures, such as requiring re-login  into a MSM product or service after a certain amount of time has elapsed.</li>
  <li>If you login to our products through the Site, cookies  can also be used to save the username so that we can process the saved login  information and quickly log you into the product.</li>
  <li>Assist in identifying possible fraudulent activities.</li>
  <li>Tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><em>Controlling  Our Use of Cookies</em></strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>You may configure your browser to accept all cookies,  reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. Each browser is  different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your  cookie preferences.</li>
  <li>The Adobe Flash Player is an application and web tool  that allows rapid development of dynamic content. Flash (and similar  applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences and usage  similar to browser cookies.Â&nbsp; MSM employs  Adobe Flash cookies in certain situations where we use Flash to provide some  content such as video clips or animation. MSM does not use Flash cookies to  serve interest-based advertising. Flash cookies are managed through the Flash  Player Settings Manager, which is a different interface than the one provided by  your web browser. This Settings Manager lets you manage global privacy  settings, storage settings, security settings, and automatic notification  settings. Beginning with Flash Player 10.3, the Flash Player Settings Manager  can be accessed locally on your computer: in the Control Panel on Windows and  in System Preferences on Mac. Users of other operating systems and earlier  versions of the Flash Player should manage their global privacy settings using  the Flash Player Settings Manager provided online from Adobe: Â&nbsp;<em>Put the new URL</em>This Site may also  use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (“Google“). Google  Analytics uses cookies, text files that are stored on your Device and allow an  analysis of your use of the Site. If Google Analytics is used, the information  generated by the cookie about your use of the Site (including the IP address)  will be transferred to and stored on a server of Google in the US. Google will  use such information to analyze your use of the Site, to create reports about  the Site activities for MSM and to provide further services associated with the  use of the Site and the internet. Furthermore, Google may transfer such  information to third parties, to the extent legally required or if such third  parties process the data on behalf of Google. In no event will Google associate  your IP address with other information of Google. By using this Site, you  consent to the processing of your information collected by Google as described  above and for the purposes described above. Google Analytics can be disabled  through this link: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a></li>
  <li>For further information about cookies you can visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. If you  choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to login or use other  interactive features of our Sites and features that depend on cookies.</li>
</ul>
<a name="4"></a>
<p><strong>2. <u>MINOR'S PERSONAL DATA</u></strong><br>
Certain Sites may  attract individuals younger than 18 years old of age ("<strong>Minor</strong>" or "<strong>Minors</strong>"). On those Sites, MSM may  collect the e-mail address and age of Minors in order to send them newsletters  and engage in other limited activities.Â&nbsp;  If you are a Minor, and you wish to provide us with your Personal Data for  any other purposes, such as to participate in a promotion or contest, you must  read this Privacy Policy with your parent or guardian and may not provide your  Personal Data without obtaining first your parent’s or guardian’s prior  consent.Â&nbsp; If we are notified or otherwise  learn that a Minor has submitted Personal Data to us through any of our Sites  other than under the conditions set forth above, we will delete that Minor's  Personal Data. Children younger than 14 years of age may only surf the Site and  play with features, but MSM does not knowingly collect data of users younger  than 14 years of age.Â&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>3. <u>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</u></strong> <br>
  We will use  Personal Data collected through the Sites to: (1) allow you to participate in  the features we offer on the Site; (2) process your registration and/or upload  your UGC; (3) provide you with information that you request or agree to  receive; (4) improve the Site and for internal business purposes; (5) contact  you with regard to your use of the Site, and any changes to our policies; (6)  tailor content, advertisements and offers we serve you; and (7) fulfil other  purposes disclosed at the time you provide your Personal Data or otherwise with  your consent.</p>
  <a name="5"></a>
<p><strong>4. <u>HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</u></strong><br>
  We may share  Personal Data with the following parties: </p>
<p><strong><em>When You Agree To  Have Your Personal Information Shared </em></strong><strong> </strong><br>
  While on our Site,  you may have the opportunity to opt-in to receive information and/or marketing  offers from someone else or to otherwise consent to the sharing of your Personal  Data with a third party. If you agree to have your Personal Data shared, your  Personal Data will be disclosed to the third party and the Personal Data you  disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and business practices of that  third party.<a name="_DV_C58"> You also may MSM  specifically request, sometimes through your use of an interactive feature, a  widget or an application, that we share your Personal Data with a third party  and we will typically do so under those circumstances.</a>Â&nbsp; In  addition, if you choose to register for a promotion, such as a competition,  prize draw or contest, your Personal Data may be disclosed to third parties for  purposes of the administration of such promotion.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sweepstakes,  Contests and Promotions.</em></strong><br>
  The Sites may offer  sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each, a "<strong>Promotion</strong>")  that may require registration. If you choose to enter a Promotion, your  Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties in connection with the  administration of such Promotion, such as in connection with winner selection,  prize fulfillment, and as required by law, such as on a winners list. By  entering a Promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that  Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where  prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name,  voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials. </p>
<p><strong><em>Personal  Data That You Disclose Publicly on the Site</em></strong><br>
  You may submit UGC  to the Site.Â&nbsp; Any such UGC will be disclosed  publicly.Â&nbsp; This Privacy Policy does not  apply to third party uses of any UGC after it is displayed on the Site.Â&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><em>Third Parties  Providing Services </em></strong><strong><em>on</em></strong><strong><em> Our Behalf</em></strong><strong> </strong><br>
  We may engage  third parties to perform functions on our behalf, such as hosting or operating  our Site, sending e-mail communications, and data analysis. We may share  Personal Data with third parties in order for them to provide content or  otherwise perform services for us, and we will require such parties to maintain  appropriate security to protect such data from unauthorized access or  processing.</p>
<p><strong><em>Affiliate Sharing  and Business Transfers</em></strong><strong> </strong><br>
  We may share your  Personal Data with other entities affiliated with us for internal reasons,  primarily for business and operational purposes. MSM or any of its assets,  including the Site, may be sold, or other transactions may occur in which your  Personal Data is one of the business assets of the transaction. In such case,  your Personal Data may be transferred. Hence, MSM reserves the right to disclose  and transfer user information, including Personal Information in connection  with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of certain of  MSM’s assets, or other corporate change including, without limitation, during  the course of any due diligence process.</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Legal Protections  and Other Disclosures</em></strong><strong> </strong><br>
  We may transfer  and disclose information, including your Personal Data, Usage Information and  Device Identifier (including IP address), to third parties: to comply with a  legal obligation; when we believe in good faith that the law requires it; at  the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; to verify  or enforce the Site's Terms of Use or other applicable policies; to respond to an emergency; or  otherwise to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of third  parties, visitors to this Site or the public. Pursuant to valid requests by law  enforcement agencies, we may also use Device Identifiers to identify users, and  may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service providers,  wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies, in our discretion. Such  disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong><a name="_DV_M89"></a><strong><u>LINKS TO OTHER WEB  SITES AND </u></strong><a name="_DV_C90"><strong><u>SERVICES, AND</u></strong></a><u> </u> <a name="_DV_M90"></a><strong><u>MSM CONTENT FOUND ON OTHER WEB SITES</u></strong><strong> </strong><br>
  The  Site may contain links that will direct you to other web sites <a name="_DV_C93">or services </a><a name="_DV_M92"></a>that are  operated and controlled by third parties<a name="_DV_M93"></a>. This includes  links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use our logo(s) as part  of a co-branding agreement. <a name="_DV_C99">We</a><a name="_DV_M96"></a> have  no control<a name="_DV_C100"> over these third parties</a><a name="_DV_M97"></a>,  and your use of their websites and  features are subject to their privacy policies.Â&nbsp;  MSM is not responsible for the privacy<a name="_DV_C103"> practices or  business</a><a name="_DV_M99"></a> practices of any third party web site.Â&nbsp; In addition, MSM may place our widgets or  other features on certain third party web sites.Â&nbsp; When we do so, any Personal Data that we  obtain about you will be subject to this Privacy Policy.Â&nbsp;<strong><u>  </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>6. INFORMATION  YOU DISCLOSE PUBLICLY ON OUR SITES</u></strong><br>
  Our Sites may offer message  boards, chat rooms, alternative reality games, multi-player games and other  public areas (collectively, "<strong>Community Forums</strong>") where you can  engage in social networking, interact with others, as well as have the  opportunity to submit photographs, writings, music, video, audio recordings,  computer graphics, pictures, data, questions, comments, suggestions or other  content, including Personal Information (collectively, "<strong>User  Submissions</strong>"). To participate in certain Community Forums, you may be  asked to select a username, screen name or member name and password. Please do  not use your real name or the real name of another person when selecting a  username (or screen name or member name). </p>
<p><strong><em>Note that anything you post  to a Community Forum is public</em></strong> -- others will have access to your User  Submissions and may use it or share it with third parties. Information you  choose to post or make available in the Community Forums may be viewed,  collected and used by others. If you choose to voluntarily disclose User  Submissions, the protections of this Privacy Policy will not cover such  disclosure of information. Think carefully before you post and use caution  before disclosing any Personal Information.</p>
<p>Also, functionality on the  Sites may permit interactions between the Sites and a third party web site or  service, such as enabling you to "like" a product on our Site or  "share" content to other web sites or services. If you choose to  "like" or "share" content on the Site or to otherwise post  information from or via the Site to a third party's web site, service, feature  or application, that information will become public and the third party may  have access to information about you and your use of our Site.</p>
<p>User Submissions may be  published online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or  hereafter developed). We may also publish your name, voice, likeness and other  Personal Information with your User Submissions, and MSM may use the content,  or any portion of the content, for advertising, marketing, publicity and  promotional activities. For full terms and conditions regarding User  Submissions you submit to the Sites, please review our Terms of Use. </p>

<p><strong><u>7. INFORMATION WE RECEIVE  FROM THIRD PARTIES </u></strong><br>
  MSM may receive information about you from third parties. For example,  if you are on another web site and you opt-in to receive information from MSM,  that web site will forward to us your e-mail address and other information  about you so that we may contact you as requested. You may also choose to  participate in a third party application or feature on our Sites (such as  logging in through Facebook Connect or otherwise linking the Sites with another  web site or interactive service) or on a third party web site or service (such  as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a  third party web site or service) through which you allow us to collect (or the  third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information. When  you choose to participate, you may be opting to link your activity on our Sites  with that third party web site or service, which may then collect information  about your visits to our Sites and may publish that activity as you request to  your "profile" or similar feature with that third party (such as if  you choose to share content you find on one of our Sites with your  "connections" on the third party's web site or service). The  information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. However, the information  collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's  privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share  information with us or with other third parties, the types of information  shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third  party's web site or service. The third party may allow you to remove the  application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information  about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information  previously collected. In addition, we may receive information about you if  other users of a third party web site or service give us access to their  profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about  you is otherwise accessible through your "connections'" web page,  profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web  site or interactive service.<br>
  We may also supplement the information we collect about you through the  Sites with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability  to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to  purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may  combine the information we receive from these third parties with information we  collect through the Sites. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to  any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.<br>
  <strong><u>8. AD SERVING AND TRAFFIC  MEASUREMENT SERVICES WE MAY USE; HOW TO "OPT OUT" OF RECEIVING  ADVERTISING RELEVANT TO YOU</u></strong><br>
  MSM licenses technology to serve advertisements on its own sites and  within its videos and other content as that content is served across the  Internet. In addition, MSM may use third party network advertisers to serve  advertisements and third party analytics service providers to evaluate and  provide us with information about the use of the Sites and viewing of our  content. We do not share Personal Information with these third parties, but ad  network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or analytics service  providers may set and access their own <strong><em>cookies</em></strong>, <strong><em>web  beacons</em></strong> and <strong><em>embedded  scripts</em></strong> on your Device and they may otherwise collect or  have access to information about you, including Usage Information. With regard  to advertisements, we and our network advertisers may target advertisements for  products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to  both the Sites and other web sites. <strong><em>Cookies</em></strong> and <strong><em>web  beacons</em></strong>, including those set by third party network advertisers,  may be used to, among other things, target advertisements, prevent you from  seeing the same advertisements too many times, or to conduct research regarding  the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may share Usage Information  about visitors to the Sites with third party advertising companies for the same  purposes. We may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements. <br>
  <strong><u>9. UPDATING YOUR  INFORMATION AND OPTING OUT FROM EMAIL, SMS AND MMS COMMUNICATIONS</u></strong><br>

If you sign up to receive SMS or MMS messages  that may be offered on the Sites, you may unsubscribe from any SMS or MMS  messages received by replying "STOP". Please note that we reserve the  right to send you certain communications relating to your account or use of the  Sites and these transactional account messages may be unaffected if you choose  to opt-out from marketing communications. In accordance with our routine record  keeping, we may delete certain records that contain Personal Information you  have submitted through the Sites. We are under no obligation to store such  Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising out of, or  related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. In addition, you  should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete  all of your information from our databases without some residual data because  of backups and other reasons.</p>

  We incorporate commercially reasonable safeguards to help protect and  secure your Personal Information. However, no electronic data transmission or  storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

In addition, when you are on the Sites you may be directed to other  web sites or services that are operated and controlled by third parties.

In addition, MSM Site widgets or other MSM  content may be included on web pages, web sites and/or services that are not  associated with MSM. We have no control over these third parties. These third  parties may send their own cookies to your Device, they may independently  collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own  published privacy policies.
