            <p>SET respects the privacy concerns of all users of the Services. 
              SET also recognizes the valuable potential of technology to help

              or Events. You may access, edit or delete your information given 
              for your SETIZENS ID. </p>

              you will be informed of the intended use(s) of the requested information.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</b></p>
