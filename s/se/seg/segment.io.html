To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, the Privacy Shield Principles and to view our certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov">www.privacyshield.gov</a>.</p><p><strong>Scope.</strong> Our certification of adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles applies to the personal data that (a) we collect from our customers and other visitors to our website for account management, billing or marketing purposes (“<strong>Segment User Data</strong>”) and (b) that we process on behalf of our customers in providing online services to them under a service agreement (“<strong>Services Data</strong>”).</p><p><strong>Data processed.</strong> The Segment User Data that we collect, use and share is described in our Privacy Policy. While our customers decide what Services Data to submit, it typically includes information about their own users and how they use the customer’s sites, applications and services and third party applications. We process Services Data as instructed by our customers and do not own or control Services Data.</p><p><strong>Purposes of data processing.</strong> We collect, use and share Segment User Data for the purposes described in our Privacy Policy.

Segment maintains contracts with these service providers restricting their access, use and disclosure of personal data in compliance with our Privacy Shield obligations, including the onward transfer provisions, and we may be liable if they fail to meet those obligations and we are responsible for the event giving rise to damage.</li><li><strong>Legal requirements.</strong> We may disclose Services Data if required to do so by law in order to (for example) respond to a subpoena or request from law enforcement, a court or a government agency, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary (a) to comply with a legal obligation, (b) to protect or defend our rights, interests or property or that of third parties, (c) to prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the services, (d) to act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of customers, their users or the public; or (e) to protect against legal liability.</li><li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Services Data may be part of the transferred assets.</li></ul><p>In addition, we may be required to disclose any personal data that we process in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p><p><strong>Your rights to access, to limit use, and to limit disclosure.</strong> Individuals in the EEA and Switzerland have rights to access personal data about them, and to limit use and disclosure of their personal data.

We will then help them to fulfill that request in accordance with their instructions.</p><p>If your personal data includes Segment Personal Data, you can request access to that data and request that we correct amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of Privacy Shield by emailing your request to <a href="mailto:privacy@segment.com">privacy@segment.com</a>.
