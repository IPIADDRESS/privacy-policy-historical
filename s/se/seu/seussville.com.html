          <font color="#003366"><b>SUMMARY</b></font><br>
          Random House takes your online privacy seriously. You may visit this 
          site anonymously as often as you like without providing any personally 
          identifying information (such as your name, address or e-mail address). 
          We do not collect personally identifying information from you except 
          when you specifically provide it, and we protect the information we 
          receive. If you ask to be added to a newsletter or other subscription 
          list, we will use a cookie to keep track of your requests so that you 
          can easily check and revise your subscriptions. We also use cookies 
          to identify your browser so that we can provide the best link to our 
          site. We never share your e-mail address with third parties except, 
          in rare instances, to protect our site or to enforce compliance with 
          ours Terms of Use. Please read below for a further explanation of what 
          information we gather and how we use it.<br>
          <br>
          <b><br>
          <font color="#003366">THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE</font></b><br>
          As you explore our Web site, you will come across places in which we 
          ask you to provide us voluntarily with information about yourself. In 
          most of these instances we are seeking only your e-mail address so that 
          we can send you the specific information that you request, such as a 
          newsletter or online subscription. In other instances, such as a contest, 
          we request both your e-mail address and your name (along with your contest 
          answer), so that we can contact you by name in the event that you win. 
          Both of these activities-the subscriptions and the contests-are purely 
          voluntary; if you do not wish to reveal your name or e-mail address 
          you are free simply to ignore these offerings. If you decide to participate, 
          we will not use your name or e-mail address for any purpose other than 
          as stated, and will not sell or rent your name or address to third parties 
          not affiliated with Random House.</p>
        <p>At other places in this site, we ask for your feedback, opinion or 
          suggestions, and provide you with a link for e-mailing us your response. 
          We may also ask for your zip code or city of residence to gather geographical 
          information about the visitors to our site. If you send your e-mail 
          to us, it will include your e-mail address in the "From" line. But again, 
          as in the case of subscriptions and contests, we promise to use the 
          e-mail address we receive in this manner only for the purpose of responding 
          to your questions or suggestions, and will not approach you with unsolicited 
          offers or provide your e-mail address to anyone else.</p>
        <p>One last area in which we ask for your name is on bulletin boards or 
          forums-places on the site where you can participate in a discussion 
          of a particular subject by posting written comments which are then entirely 
          public. We ask for a name simply so that other people reading a string 
          of comments will be able to determine which comments come from the same 
          person. You may, therefore, provide a nickname or alias, if you prefer, 
          so that your identity is not disclosed. You should be aware that if 
          you do voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g. user name, e-mail 
          address) on the bulletin boards or forums, that information can be collected 
          and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other 
          posters or parties. If you choose to participate anonymously, you should 
          remember that you are still legally liable for the material you post, 
          including claims of libel, invasion of privacy and copyright infringement.<br>
          <b><br>
          <font color="#003366">REMOVING YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS</font></b><br>
          We do not at present collect any personally identifying information 
          from children under age 13. If we do so in the future, we will comply 
          with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. 
          Our practices may change from time to time, so please check back here 
          periodically to review our latest policy. </p>
<br>
        <font color="#003366"><b>COOKIES</b></font><br>
        Cookies are electronic tags that most major Web sites place on your computer 
        in the process of sending your computer a file, such as a Web page. We 
        use them in a limited fashion as well. In essence, a cookie is a unique 
        bit of computer code that is placed on your computer the first time you 
        visit our site. It tells us simply when a computer that has previously 
        visited our site returns, and it identifies your computer's browser and 
        operating system to help us make the best connection. We also use cookies 
        to keep track of your subscriptions to various Random House lists. In 
        no event does the cookie we place on your computer tell us anything about 
        your visits to other Web sites or your use of the Internet in any other 
        way. 
        <p>If you would prefer not to receive any cookies, most browsers can be 
          set to refuse cookies or to alert you when one is being sent. It is 
          possible, however, that some portions of this site may not function 
          properly if the cookies are disabled.</p>
<br>
        <font color="#003366"><b>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</b></font> <br>
        Our site contains links to other sites that are not under our control, 
          even though they may use the Random House name or logo on their site 
          through an agreement with us. Such other sites do not necessarily follow 
          our privacy policies, and may place their own cookies on your computer. 
          This practice is standard on the Web, and we do not control cookies 
          placed on your computer by third parties whose advertising or links 
          appear on our site. 
<br>
        <p> <b><font color="#003366">SECURITY OF PRIVATE INFORMATION</font></b> 
          <br>
          We would like to be able to tell you that the information you provide 
          us is absolutely safe. Unfortunately, several well-publicized instances 
          of computer security breaches make it impossible for anyone to be so 
          confident. The most we can tell you is that we take reasonable steps 
          to protect the information you provide us from theft, alteration or 
          unauthorized inspection. In addition, in rare instances, we will disclose 
          private information to necessary parties to protect our site or other 
          visitors, or to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use. 
        </p><p><br>
        </p><p> <font color="#003366"><b>KIDS</b></font><br>
          We do not at present collect any personally identifying information 
          from children under age 13. Our policy may change in the future, so 
          please check back here regularly to get our latest policy.<br>
          <br>
</p><p>
          <font color="#003366"><b>PARENTS AND GUARDIANS:</b></font><br>
          We encourage you to get involved with your children's online usage and 
          to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. We also 
          ask you to check back here regularly to see what our latest policies 
          are, particularly those relating to children.
        </p><p>You should be aware that if your children voluntarily disclose their 
          names, e-mail addresses or other information on bulletin boards or chat 
          areas of other Web sites, such disclosures may result in unsolicited 
          messages from other parties. We suggest that you discourage your child 
          from providing such information on this site or elsewhere unless you 
          are confident that the information will not be misused.<br>
          <br>
          If you have any concerns regarding privacy issues, please contact us 
          at the above e-mail address, and browse away!</p>
