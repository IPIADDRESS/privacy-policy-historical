				</p><br><br>
				<p>
					<strong>
						a)&nbsp; Order Fulfillment
					</strong>
				</p><br>
				<p>
					We may collect and use your information to process and ship your orders, and to inform you about the status of your orders. Depending on how you make a purchase, this could involve the collection and use of certain personal contact information, payment information, account login information, and/or information related to your purchase (such as products ordered).

					<strong>
						c)&nbsp; Marketing Communications
					</strong>
				</p><br>
				<p>
					We may collect and use your information to send you marketing communications, such as catalogues, email communications, and SMS text messages. These communications may inform you about new products, events, special discounts, and other news and special offers. Sending you these communications mostly requires the collection and use of certain personal contact information and limited demographic information (such as zip code). In some instances (such as for text messaging programs), this may involve the use of your precise geographical location (obtained from your mobile device) so that we can send you location-based offers. You can always opt-out from receiving marketing emails or text messages by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each such communication. Please note that even if you opt out from receiving marketing communications, you may still receive other communications from us, such as order confirmations, and other important announcements (e.g., product recalls, privacy policy changes, etc.).

This means that we may be required to release of your personal information in order to the law enforcement officials or to third parties to respond to a warrant, subpoena, court order, or as may be required by a State or Federal law, regulation, or statute.
