<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>What information do we collect?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Depending on how you interact with SGBM, we may collect from you various types of information, which are described in more detail below. In some instances (and unless we say otherwise below), we may combine one type of information with another, and store them together in our records.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may collect and use your information to personalize your experience and save you time when you visit our Website. This is typically done through the use of automated technologies (such as cookies) that collect and remember certain account login information, technical information, and/or previous website usage information.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>c)&nbsp; Marketing Communications</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may collect and use your information to send you marketing communications, such as catalogues, email communications, and SMS text messages. These communications may inform you about new products, events, special discounts, and other news and special offers. Sending you these communications mostly requires the collection and use of certain personal contact information and limited demographic information (such as zip code). In some instances (such as for text messaging programs), this may involve the use of your precise geographical location (obtained from your mobile device) so that we can send you location-based offers. You can always opt-out from receiving marketing emails or text messages by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each such communication. Please note that even if you opt out from receiving marketing communications, you may still receive other communications from us, such as order confirmations, and other important announcements (e.g., product recalls, privacy policy changes, etc.).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>d)&nbsp; Other Uses of your Information</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are required to respond to valid legal inquiries from law enforcement or related third parties. This means that we may be required to release of your personal information in order to the law enforcement officials or to third parties to respond to a warrant, subpoena, court order, or as may be required by a State or Federal law, regulation, or statute. If at any time we suspect your use of the Site, or its information or services, is illegal or may be in connection with an illegal, fraudulent, or otherwise prohibited activity, we will not permit you to use the Site and we may inform the appropriate authorities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To enforce our Terms of Service agreement and otherwise manage our business.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH?</strong></p>

<p>We may share your information with certain companies (in the situations) described below. We do not rent or sell your information to third party companies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>a)&nbsp; Third Party Service Providers</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may use third party service providers, including our Partners in the voucher program, to help us operate our business, or administer activities on our behalf, such as sending emails, fulfilling your product and service requests, updating information, mailing products or managing payments. We may share your information with these third parties for limited purposes.

SGBM uses security measures consistent with standard industry practice to protect that information.</p>

<p><strong>b)&nbsp; Measures You Can Take</strong></p>

<p>It is also important for you to play a role in keeping your information safe. When signing up for any online account, please be sure to choose an account password that is hard for others to guess and never to reveal it to anyone else. If you use a shared or public computer, never choose to have your login ID or password remembered and make sure to log out of your account every time you leave the computer. &nbsp;You may, at any time limit, or discontinue, your use of the Site, or its information and services. You must understand, however, that even after you terminate your use of the Site, we may still retain certain personal information in our databases and servers.
