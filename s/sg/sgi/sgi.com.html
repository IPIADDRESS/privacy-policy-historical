<span class="header">SGI Privacy Policy</span>

<p>Thank you for visiting the SGI ("SGI") Internet web site located under the universal resource locator at www.sgi.com ("Site"). Protecting your privacy is important to SGI.  We are pleased to provide this Privacy Policy governing our collection and use of personally identifiable information. </p>

<p>SGI is a global organization with legal entities, business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders. Our privacy practices are designed to provide protection for your personal information all over the world. We may share your personal information within SGI and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business. Some countries may provide less legal protection for your information. In such countries SGI will still handle information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><b>What we collect and how we use it</b></p>

<p>SGI may ask you to provide personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, social security number, job category, information about your company, and credit card information. We will not rent, sell or lease this personally identifiable information to other companies or individuals. This information may be gathered when you visit the Site to: provide feedback in an online survey; request product or service information; participate in a sweepstake offer; register for a conference; make purchases; and/or save a product configuration. When you provide such information to us, we may use it to: deliver requested goods, services or information; provide notices regarding goods or services that you may purchase or be interested in; and to improve the content and general administration of the Site.  In connection with a job application or inquiry, whether advertised on this Site or otherwise, you may provide us with a resume or curriculum vitae. We may use this information throughout SGI and its related entities for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry. Except where you tell us not to, we will keep the information for future consideration.</p>

<p>If you participate in an SGI mailing list, you should be aware that the information you provide there will be made broadly available to others, potentially inside or outside SGI, who have access to that mailing list. Also, please recognize that mailing lists may have additional rules and conditions. Opinions expressed in a mailing list are those of the participants and shouldn't be considered as reflecting SGI's opinion.</p>
