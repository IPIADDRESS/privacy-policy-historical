</p><p>

Your privacy is important to us at SGI.  We follow the industry practices
to let you know how our privacy policy answers the following
questions:</p>

<p>1. What information does SGI gather/track and how is it used?</p>

<p>2. With whom does SGI share the information it gathers/tracks?</p>

<p>3. What is SGI's unsubscribe and data-removal policy?</p>

<p>4. How can I correct and update my personal information?</p>

<p>5. What is SGI's policy on deleting or de-activating my name from its
database?</p>

<p>6. Who can I ask if I have any additional questions?</p>

<p>We do not collect personal information about you unless you voluntarily
provide it to us and we collect, process and use personal information only
for performing the relevant service selected by you.  That information
will be gathered when you come onto our site to: provide feedback in an
online survey; request product information; request a contact from an SGI
sales representative; participate in a sweepstakes offer; and/or save a
product configuration on our web site.  The personal information that may
be gathered includes your name, fax, telephone number, street address and
e-mail address.  You may also be asked for further information about
yourself such as your job category and your industry type, your company
name and job title, and the number of people in your company.  When you   
purchase products we will collect your credit card number and its
expiration date.  Of course, if you do not wish to give us your credit
card or other personal information over the web, you may place an order
with a representative over the telephone by calling us at (888) 400-4SGI.
For your protection, we hold your information on our secured systems for
use by SGI personnel who assist you in your use of our site for a period
of time reasonable in light of the purpose for which it is processed.  We
provide your credit card information to the credit card processing company
to charge you for your purchases and we provide your name and address to
our fulfillment house to ship products to you.  The fulfillment house is
not permitted to send your information to anyone else.</p>

<p>We will use best efforts to not transfer information that personally
identifies you to anyone else without your knowledge and approval at the
time it is collected from you.  You will also have the opportunity then to
indicate whether you wish to decline to receive promotional or marketing
material about other products and services of SGI or others.  Please note,
however, that we do intend to contact you about matters that affect your
use of our site such as the status of your orders for our products you buy
or prizes you may win in a sweepstakes.</p>

<p>Upon your request, we will assist you to review, to delete or to
correct or update your personal information that you have previously     
provided.  If at any time you believe that we have not adhered to our
policy with respect to protecting your privacy, or if you have questions 
regarding the collecting and/or use of your personal information or 
regarding our privacy policy, please contact us.  We will use all
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly address your concern.  You may
contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@sgi.com">webmaster@sgi.com</a>, by
simply putting "privacy" in the subject line.</p>
