                    <p>SGI is administrator of Saskatchewan's compulsory automobile insurance program under <em>The Automobile Accident Insurance Act</em>. This program provides Saskatchewan residents with insurance coverage if they are injured in a motor vehicle collision. If you are seeking to obtain automobile injury benefits, the Act requires our customer to provide SGI with personal information and personal health information to determine entitlement to the statutory benefits under this program. If you do not provide SGI with the personal information requested, you can be denied benefits. SGI does not request more personal information or personal health information than required, but the nature of your claim or the injuries you sustain may require SGI to collect a significant amount of information.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Regulating our collection</h3>
                    
                    <p>On occasion, as a result of requesting your personal health information to determine your entitlement to SGI's automobile injury benefit program, SGI may obtain more personal health information than necessary to determine your entitlement to benefits. In these situations, SGI will make every effort to ensure that the unnecessary personal information is removed from your file where that information is easily separated from the personal health information SGI requires to determine your benefit entitlement. SGI will destroy that information in a confidential manner. If you have any concerns in this regard, please contact us for assistance.</p>

<h3>How SGI uses your Information</h3>

                    <p>Many organizations seek to collect or retain a copy of your driver's licence or photo identification for other reasons (e.g., to verify identity or prevent fraud).

                  <h3>Disclosing your information</h3>
                    
                    <p>When you submit an application for insurance through your broker or apply for insurance online, and you are applying for insurance with all member companies with SGI. The consent you provide allows your broker to disclose your information to us, and provides SGI with permission to disclose your information to:</p>
                  <ul class="ul-listcontent">
                      <li>Your broker or agent;</li>
                      <li>All member companies of SGI      CANADA;</li>
                      <li>Insurance tracking or      reporting agencies used by SGI CANADA;</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>If you request or consent to the release of your information to a 3rd party, SGI will release your information as requested. For example, when you access your SGI information on the MySGI website and associate yourself with an Issuer, you are agreeing to the release of your driver licensing and vehicle registration information to that Licence Issuer.</p>
                    
                    <p>  SGI is required to comply with <em>The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. </em>This Act not only sets out our obligations to protect your personal information, but indicates when that information may be disclosed without your consent.</p>
                    
  <h4>Without your consent, we can share your information:</h4>
                  <ul class="ul-listcontent">

                    <h4>Licence Issuers</h4>
                    <p>To better assist the Saskatchewan public in obtaining driver licence and vehicle registration services, SGI contracts with independent Licence Issuers to provide these services in various communities.&nbsp; All Licence Issuers have access to the SGI Driver Licensing and Vehicle Registration Database for the purpose of providing this service.&nbsp; The release of this information is subject to strict confidentiality requirements.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Personal Health Information</h4>
                    <p>The collection of your personal health information for no-fault injury benefits is used only by the SGI Claims Division; it is not shared with other departments in SGI other than SGI’s Medical Review Unit.&nbsp; Information is only shared with the SGI Medical Review Unit in a situation where the personal health information collected by SGI during the administration of your injury benefits indicates you have a medical condition that may impact on&nbsp; your ability to drive a motor vehicle.</p>
                    
                    <p>  Your personal health information is only disclosed by SGI for the purpose of providing you with automobile injury benefits. Unless required by law, we do not share your personal health information with our affiliates or with any 3rd parties except to provide you with injury benefits. Your personal health information may be disclosed to medical consultants, lawyers or other professional experts (e.g. vocational or rehabilitation consultants, physiotherapist, etc.) SGI hires to assist them in determining your entitlement to benefits, your rehabilitation needs, the extent of your injuries from a motor vehicle collision, and the type of treatment that your insurance coverage must provide. Subject to a legal requirement to disclose your information, the confidentiality of your personal information and personal health information is a requirement of any disclosure. If you appeal a decision SGI makes regarding your entitlement to benefits to either the courts or the Automobile Injury Appeal Commission, SGI may disclose your personal health information for the purpose of defending its decision.</p>
