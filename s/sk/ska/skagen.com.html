The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for skagen.com and any site from which you access this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Website").</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</b></h3>
<p>"Personal Information" is information through which you can be identified. The Personal Information that Skagen Denmark collects includes Personal Information collected in any Skagen Denmark Stores, the Skagen Denmark Website, any Skagen Denmark mobile application, or by any of our service providers through our website or in our stores. &nbsp;Please note that this Privacy Policy DOES NOT apply to information we collected through any SKAGEN App or SKAGEN Branded device. &nbsp;Please refer to the Privacy Policies in the Skagen App for information on privacy for that information. The Personal Information that Skagen Denmark collects depends on the nature of your activities, including, but not limited to, whether you make a purchase or order, make a return, make an exchange, complete a survey, contact us for information, register for a promotion, join a forum, download software, create an account on the website, write a review, create a wishlist and proceed through the checkout process on the website. Personal Information that Skagen Denmark may collect from you may include your name, address, email address, your employer, phone number, your login and password, order information, and comments that may identify you, and other information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>HOW WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></h3>
<p>Skagen Denmark uses Your Personal Information to identify you to respond to your online email requests, to register you for certain activities/access on the Website at your request and to confirm that registration, to help identify you in the event you lose your password, to process your warranty and repair requests, to process returns and exchanges, to process personal shopper requests, to process catalog requests, to process email marketing requests, to process product reviews, to process your entry into sweepstakes or promotions, to provide you with free gifts and other promotional offers, to notify you of changes made to our policies, to combine the Personal Information with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our marketing partners and others, and to otherwise maximize your access to our services and products, and order processing/fulfillment. With respect to use of the Website, without transmitting your Personal Information, you can still use most of our Website, however, you will not be able to send us email inquiries, access certain features/sections, complete a survey, register online for giveaways, request a catalog, request email marketing notifications, write product reviews, create a wish list, or make an online purchase.</p>
<p>We may contact you for direct marketing purposes per e-mail, mail, or via other electronic communication methods (e.g. social media) unless you have opted-out from receiving further direct marketing messages (see below for your opt-out options). For certain types of direct marketing methods (e.g. text messaging), we will obtain your explicit consent prior to sending you direct marketing messages.</p>
<p>In furtherance of the foregoing uses, your Personal Information may also be shared with Skagen Denmark' employees, agents, representatives, and selected third party service providers or partners (as set forth further below) who will be under an obligation to Skagen Denmark to use reasonable care to keep this information confidential and are prohibited from using your Personal Information for any purpose other than in connection with the services they provide to us. Skagen Denmark may hire companies to help deliver products or services, like a shipping company that delivers a package or a company that helps facilitate our direct marketing communications. In those instances, there is a need to share your Personal Information with these contracted companies. Your opt-out choices below will not apply to sharing of your information by Skagen Denmark with any of these companies.</p>
<p>Where we engage service providers that use Personal Information on behalf of us we will use reasonable measures to contractually ensure that Personal Information is only used for the purposes defined by us and (provided that your Personal Information is subject to the Privacy Shield) we will remain liable for the requirement that processing of Personal Information by a service provider is consistent with our instructions unless we are not responsible for such inconsistent processing.</p>
<p>Unless you have opted out of such marketing use as set forth herein, occasionally we may also share your Personal Information with select third parties so that they can send you promotional materials about goods and services ("promotional purposes") offered by them. We may also share your Personal Information with organizations that represent multiple third parties who either may send you promotional materials about goods and services offered by those third parties or share your Personal Information with those third parties so that they can send you promotional materials about goods and services offered by them. We may also occasionally share your Personal Information with organizations that combine the Personal Information with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our marketing partners and other third parties. We use that combined information to enhance your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about our products, to inform you of events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes. We also may share that combined information with third parties so that they can send you promotional materials about goods and services offered by them. When sharing your information for promotional purposes, Skagen Denmark attempts to select reputable companies that offer high quality products and services. When we share your Personal Information with a third party, your Personal Information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your Personal Information. You may choose to opt-out of sharing your information with third parties as described below.</p>
<p>In the event that you enter into a sweepstakes or other giveaway, your Personal Information may be shared according to the rules of that particular sweepstakes, giveaway or promotion. Any personal information you include in the text of a product review may be made public in the product review section of the website. The information contained in your wish list may be shared with the friends and family that you instruct us to share it with.</p>
<p>In addition to the foregoing uses, Skagen Denmark may also disclose Personal Information:</p>
<p>to comply with a court order, subpoena, search warrant or other legal process;</p>
<p>to comply with legal, regulatory or administrative requirements of any governmental authorities, including requests to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;</p>
<p>to protect and defend Skagen Denmark, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and all of their officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, contractors, and partners, in connection with any legal action, claim or dispute;</p>
<p>to enforce the Terms of Use of our Website; and</p>
<p>in connection with the purchase of a business or a sale of one or more of our businesses or its assets, provided that any purchasing party agrees to adhere to terms similar to those of this Privacy Policy (if your information is subject to Privacy Shield we will provide you with an opportunity to reject the transfer of your Personal Information in such cases); and</p>
<p>to prevent imminent physical harm.</p>
<p>Generally, you may not opt-out of service related communications, which are not promotional in nature. Nor will your opt-out choices apply to sharing by Skagen Denmark of your Personal Information with the service providers or partners used by Skagen Denmark to enhance your experience on the Website and/or to allow Skagen Denmark to provide you with more personalized promotional materials, as set forth in this Privacy Policy. However, you can opt-out of direct promotional communications from Skagen Denmark, or sharing of Personal Information with third parties for the purposes of promotional communications, by following the unsubscribe instructions within each communication or emailing us at skagen@skagen.com.</p>
<p>Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Skagen Denmark will not sell, trade, or disclose to third parties any Personal Information obtained through Skagen Denmark or from third parties without your consent. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy and any choices you make on the Website will not necessarily apply to Personal Information you may have provided to any third parties in the context of other, separately operated, operations or in connection with unrelated products or services.</p>

If you are located outside the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including Personal Information, may be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, by using Skagen Denmark’s websites or providing us with any information, you consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of your information in the United States.
