<p align="justify">
  This privacy policy provides you with information on the type, scope and purpose of the collection and use of your personal data.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  Personal data is information concerning data subjects (natural persons) whose identity is determined or at least can be determined (e.g. name, address, email address or IP address).
</p>
<h2>
  2. Data collected during use of our website

  We store your personal data only for as long as is required in order to fulfil the above purposes and to comply with our contractual or legal obligations. If we no longer need your personal data, we will delete it from our systems and records or we will anonymise it so that you can no longer be identified.

<h3>
  7.2 Use of Google Analytics
</h3>
<p align="justify">
  Parts of our website and our mobile applications use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics collects information about your use of this application, which is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. If IP anonymisation is activated in this application, your IP address is truncated by Google beforehand within member states of the European Union or in other states that are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and saved there. Google uses this information on behalf of this application's operator to evaluate your use of the application, to compile reports about application activity and to provide further services relating to application and internet usage to the operator of this application. The IP address sent by the application for the purposes of Google Analytics is not combined with other data from Google. In mobile applications, you can deactivate the storage of usage information and the recording of data generated relating to your use of the application (including your IP address) by Google, as well as the processing of this data by Google in the application under "More" -&gt; "Google Analytics".
</p>

<p align="justify">
  We draw your attention to the fact that, within this application, the code "ga('set','anonymizeIp', true);" has been added to Google Analytics to ensure that IP addresses collected are anonymised (IP masking).
</p>
<p align="justify">
  You can also disable the setting of cookies via your <a href="#browser">browser settings</a> or download a corresponding browser plug-in from <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.

<h3>
  7.3 Use of ÖWA
</h3>
<p align="justify">
  Our website uses the scalable central measurement system (SCMS) of Österreichische Webanalyse (ÖWA) to determine statistical values for the use of our services. Anonymous measured values are collected. This reach measurement method uses either a cookie with the identifier "oewabox.at" or a signature created from various automatically transmitted information on your computer to recognise computer systems. IP addresses are not stored as part of this process and are only processed in anonymised form. This method of measuring reach was developed taking privacy into account. The aim of the reach measurement process is to statistically calculate usage intensity and the number of users of a website. Individual users are never identified. The system also does not deliver any advertising. The usage statistics collected by ÖWA are published on a monthly basis and can be viewed at <a href="http://www.oewa.at/basic/online-angebote" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> http://www.oewa.at/basic/online-angebote</a>.

<h3>
  7.4 Use of IVW
</h3>
<p align="justify">
  Our website (geizhals.de only) uses the scalable central measurement system (SCMS) of INFOnline GmbH to determine statistical values for the use of our services.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Anonymous measured values are collected. This reach measurement method uses either a cookie with the identifier "ioam.de", "ivwbox.de", a local storage object or a signature created from various automatically transmitted browser information to recognise computer systems. IP addresses are only processed in anonymised form.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  This method of measuring reach was developed taking privacy into account. The aim of the reach measurement process is to statistically calculate usage intensity and the number of users of a website. Individual users are never identified. Your identity always remains protected. You will not receive advertising via the system. For websites that are members of the Informationsgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern e.V. (IVW - http://www.ivw.eu) or take part in the "internet facts" study of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online-Forschung e.V. (AGOF - www.agof.de), usage statistics are published monthly by the AGOF and the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Media-Analyse e.V. (ag.ma - www.agma-mmc.de), as well as the IVW, and can be viewed at <a href="http://www.agof.de" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> http://www.agof.de</a> , <a href="http://www.agma-mmc.de" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> http://www.agma-mmc.de</a> and <a href="http://www.ivw.eu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> http://www.ivw.eu</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  In addition to publishing measurement data, IVW regularly reviews the SCMS method to ensure usage in compliance with rules and data protection requirements.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Further information on the SCMS can be found on the website of INFOnline GmbH ( <a href="https://www.infonline.de" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> https://www.infonline.de</a> ), which operates the SCMS, the data protection website of AGOF ( <a href="http://www.agof.de/datenschutz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> http://www.agof.de/datenschutz</a> ) and the data protection website of IVW ( <a href="http://www.ivw.eu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> http://www.ivw.eu</a> ).

<h3>
  7.5 Use of Google DFP
</h3>
<p align="justify">
  Our websites use Google DoubleClick server technologies. This is a service provided by DoubleClick, a company of Google Ireland Limited, Ireland. The DoubleClick server enables us to control advertising. Google uses DoubleClick DART cookies for this purpose, which use information about user visits to the website and other websites, to display certain ads based on "frequency capping". This is a method of defining the frequency of advertisements based on standardised criteria.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  However, you may disable the use of DoubleClick DART cookies at any time.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  To do this, you will need to follow these instructions to deactivate cookies from Google:
  <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin?hl=en-GB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin?hl=en-GB</a>
  or
  <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> https://adssettings.google.com/</a>
</p>

<p align="justify">
  In addition to this, the DoubleClick DART cookies also enable "click fraud detection", which can exclude spam attacks and the illegal manipulation of Google server structures. For this purpose, Google stores the IP addresses of the requesting server for a period of nine months. However, these IP addresses are only used for the purposes of fraud detection and are then permanently deleted. Advertising analyses are not performed based on IP addresses.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  In addition, you can disable personalised Google advertising that is shown when you visit one of the more than two million websites whose operators cooperate with Google, as well as personalised advertising from over 100 other online advertising networks:

<h2>
  8. Online advertising
</h2>
<h3>
  8.1 Usage-based online advertising
</h3>
<p align="justify">
  Usage-based online advertising, also known as "online behavioural advertising" (OBA), is a technology that uses the anonymous collection and processing of your usage behaviour to enable advertising to be displayed that is optimised for you and targets your predicted interests. As a user, you benefit from receiving advertising that is more likely to fit your interests and from the fact that less randomly distributed advertising is delivered. A cookie is stored on your computer to record your usage behaviour. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive and enable returning users to be recognised but do not enable you to be personally identified.
</p>

<p align="justify">
They record information about your activities on our websites (e.g. browsing behaviour, sub-pages of our website visited, clicked advertising banners etc.).
</p>

<p align="justify">
Since, in accordance with applicable law, it cannot be entirely ruled out that the collected data could be indirectly associated with an individual, all usage data is stored using a pseudonym, making personal identification almost impossible. The IP address transmitted by your computer for technical reasons is anonymised/pseudonymised and is not used for the controlled display of advertising as described above.
</p>

<p align="justify">
You can find more information on usage-based online advertising on the website of the European Advertising Standards Alliance (EASA):

<p align="justify">
  Nowadays, online advertising is often integrated via media agencies. They represent a variety of advertisers. In order to manage advertising materials centrally and control their display on publishers' sites (= our website), the media agency's own ad server is often used in addition to the publisher's ad server. This process is called tag-in-tag placement. As a result of this, personal data (e.g. IP addresses) is sometimes then processed or cookies set.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  We currently have agreements with the following agencies for the placement of online advertising. These agencies are also obliged to comply with data protection regulations. If you have no interest in these agencies processing your personal data or setting cookies, then the opt-out options described below are available:

</p>

<h3>
  Contract fulfillment according to Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR:
</h3>
<p align="justify">
  Processing of your personal data is legal if it is necessary to fulfill a contract of which you are a party. This also applies to the implementation of pre-contractual measures.

<h3>
  Legal obligation according to Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR:
</h3>
<p align="justify">
  If personal data processing is required to fulfill a legal obligation to which our company is subject, we are required to process your data.

</p>

<h3>
  Legitimate interest according to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR:

  This is the case if the processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the person concerned do not outweigh the former interest.
</p>

<h2>
