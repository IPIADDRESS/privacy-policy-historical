					<h2>INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</h2>
					<ol class="main">
						<li>
							We collect information on Users in order to facilitate the operation of the SkillPages Platform.
						</li>
						<li>
							The User consents and knowingly chooses to disclose all information that is uploaded to the SkillPages 
					Platform in the form of a SkillPage. When you add to your SkillPage with further information about yourself, 
					you agree that any registration information you give to SkillPages will always be accurate, correct and up to date.
						</li>
						<li>
							The SkillPages Search Facility is available to all Users. Users are also invited to enter personal 
					information which provides an enhanced set of search results.
							<ol class="main letters">
								<li>
									When you sign up for a SkillPages Account (or 'SkillPage') or other SkillPages services or 
						promotions that require registration, we ask you for personal information such as name and 
						email address. After you have created your SkillPage we provide you with the option to add 
						additional personal information such as phone number. We may combine the information that 
						you submit under your SkillPage with information from other SkillPages, in order to provide 
						you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services or to suggest to you 
						people you might know, or other people who may have skills of interest to you. For certain 
						information, we  give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information within 
						your account settings page.
								</li>
								<li>
									SkillPages provides an invitation service when you register with the Platform. If you choose 
						(consent or opt in) to use our invitation service to tell a contact about our site, we will 
						ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as your contact’s email address 
						or we will ask you to consent to having your contact list(s) imported. We will send your 
						contacts an email in your name inviting him or her to visit the site, and we will send 
						additional reminders. SkillPages stores this information to send invitations and 
						reminders, to register a contact connection if your invitation is accepted, to allow you to 
						see invitations you have sent and to track the success of our referral program. All information 
						that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this privacy 
						policy as cover your own information. SkillPages also stores this information (imported contacts information) 
						to avoid duplication of contacts and to check when contacts, not invited by the User, join 
						the SkillPages Platform through registration. SkillPages will also store the User’s access 
						details in order to synch the contacts whenever the User logs in.
								</li>
								<li>
									When you visit SkillPages, we use a third party tracking partner to gather certain information 
						automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) 
						addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating 
						system, date/time stamp and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify 
						individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around 
						the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
								</li>
								<li>
									In addition, we store certain information from your browser using 'cookies'. For more information about how we use cookies, please refer to the <a href="http://www.skillpages.com/cookies" target="_blank">SkillPages cookie policy</a>.
								</li>
								<li>
									Our third party service providers use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web 
						Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. 
						Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies and are used 
						to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s 
						computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the 
						period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our 
						customers’ personally identifiable information.
								</li>
								<li>
									When you use SkillPages, you may set up your SkillPage, form community networks, send messages, 
						perform searches and queries, set up events, add applications, transmit information through 
						various channels and send emails or other communications to SkillPages. We collect the personal 
						information as outlined above so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. 
						In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you 
						have sent or easily see your community network list.
								</li>
								<li>
									SkillPages have the right to reformat and move SkillPages, and SkillPage information. SkillPages 
						reserve the right to remove, edit the look and feel of, move or close any SkillPage for any 
						reason and to suspend or ban any User Account for any reason.
								</li>
								<li>
									SkillPages may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links 
						have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, 
						customized content and advertising.
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on SkillPages is a violation of the 
				SkillPages Terms and Conditions of Use.
						</li>
						<li>
							SkillPages only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy 
				Policy. In addition to the above, such purposes include:
							<ol class="main letters">
								<li>
									Providing our services, primarily making SkillPages available to all;
								</li>
								<li>
									Providing more relevant search results by utilizing data provided by the User;
								</li>
								<li>
									Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;
								</li>
								<li>
									Ensuring the technical functioning of SkillPages;

								<li>
									Protecting the rights or property of SkillPages or our Users; and

								<li>
									Developing new services.

						<li>
							By using SkillPages, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and 
				processed in such jurisdictions as is necessary.
						</li>
						<li>
							We provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site. If you participate, 
				we will link certain personally identifiable information provided when you registered 
				for the site to you. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you 
				therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. We use this information 
				to gauge the level of user satisfaction with the site. We use a third party service provider 
				to conduct these surveys. That company is prohibited from using our users’ personally 
				identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable 
				information you provide through a survey with other third parties unless we give you prior 
				notice and choice.

					<h2>USE OF INFORMATION OBTAINED BY SKILLPAGES</h2>
					<ol class="main">
						<li>
							When you register with SkillPages, you create your own SkillPage. We may use your name and email address to send you notifications. If you no longer wish to 
				receive these email communications, you may unsubscribe by following the instruction 
				contained in each of the emails you receive.
						</li>
						<li>
							SkillPage information is used by SkillPages primarily to be presented back to and 
				edited by you when you access the service and to be presented to all.
						</li>
						<li>
							The SkillPage information that you submit to SkillPages (including phone numbers) will be available to all 
				Users of the SkillPages Platform (whether the user is or is not a registered member of the SkillPages platform). All SkillPage information will be available in 
				search results generated for Users and may be made available to third-party search 
				engines. If you no longer wish to have your information indexed you have the option 
				of deleting your Account. People that see your name in searches will be able to 
				access your SkillPage information without registering with the SkillPages Platform. 
				If you do not want to be listed in our directory you have the option of deleting your Account.
						</li>
						<li>
							SkillPage information is used by SkillPages to improve the functionality of the SkillPages Platform.
						</li>
						<li>
							SkillPages may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the 
				general operation of the service.
						</li>
						<li>
							SkillPages reserves the right to send you notices about your Account even if 
				you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.
						</li>
						<li>
							SkillPages may use information in your SkillPage without identifying you as an 
				individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many 
				people are in a network like a group of electricians, and also personalizing advertisements 
				and promotions so that we can provide you with up to date SkillPages promotions and 
				sponsors of community groupings. We believe this benefits you. Where such information 
				is used, we generally allow you to specify in your User Account Settings that you do 
				not want this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection of this 
				information to your SkillPage (e.g. removing photo tag links).
						</li>
						<li>
							We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally 
				identifiable information. We do obtain the user consent via email prior to 
				posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. If 
				you wish to request the removal of your testimonial, you may contact us at 
				<a href="mailto:help@skillpagessupport.com">help@skillpagessupport.com</a>.

					<h2>CHILDREN AGED UNDER 14</h2>
					<p>SkillPages does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone 
			under the age of 14 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 
			14, please do not attempt to register for SkillPages or send any personal information

			No one under the age of 14 may provide any personal information to SkillPages on the 
			SkillPages Platform. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal 
			information from a child under the age of 14 without verification of parental consent, 
			we will delete that information.</p>

					<h2>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</h2>
					<ol class="main">
						<li>
							SkillPages is about sharing catalogued skill information with Users. We 
				share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances 
				where we believe such sharing is (1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 
				(2) legally required or (3) permitted by you.
						</li>
						<li>
							We may provide information to service providers such as an email service 
				provider to send out emails on our behalf, an author management service to 
				provide you with our blog and a customer support service to gather feedback 
				and assist you with questions to help us bring you the services we offer. 
				Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business. In 
				connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers 
				may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in 
				connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the 
				processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and 
				technical protections limiting the use of that information to the SkillPages-specified 
				purposes. This site uses various analytics services to monitor and improve the 
				quality and usability of the SkillPages Platform.
						</li>
						<li>
							We may be required to disclose User information pursuant to lawful requests, such 
				as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal 
				information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law 
				enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we 
				may share Account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with 
				law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity 
				perpetrated through the SkillPages service or using the SkillPages name, or to prevent 
				imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, 
				lawyers, agents or government agencies.
						</li>
						<li>
							If SkillPages becomes involved in a merger, acquisition or any form of sale of some or 
				all of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the 
				assets transferred.  You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our

				Facebook to make your experiences on those applications and websites better and more commercial.

						<li>
							We are not responsible for any third party applications and websites that you interact 
				with through the SkillPages Platform.
						</li>
						<li>
							If you log in to SkillPages using one of these application’s or website’s sign-in services 
				and connect with your SkillPages Account, that application or website can access information 
				on SkillPages related to you and your contacts and generate and publish stories about 
				actions you take on that application or website without any additional permission. An application 
				or website that you connect with can generally access the same information that you can see 
				about yourself and your contacts, and an application or website that your contacts connect 
				with can access the same information about you that the contacts can see.
						</li>
						<li>
							You can report any suspected misuse of the SkillPages Platform to us, and we will 
				investigate the claim and take appropriate action.
						</li>
						<li>
							If the ownership of all or substantially all of the SkillPages business, or individual 
				business units owned by SkillPages Holdings Limited, were to change, your User information 
				may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such 
				transfer of information, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our 
				Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any 
				choices you may have regarding your personal information.
						</li>
