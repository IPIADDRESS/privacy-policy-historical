								When you sign up for a SkillPages User Profile Account or other SkillPages services or promotions
								that require registration, we ask you for personal information. For certain services,

								information, which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine
								the information that you submit under your account with information from other SkillPages

								of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out
								of combining such information. 
							</li>
							<li>
								SkillPages provides an invitation service when you register with the Platform. If you
								choose (consent or opt in) to use our invitation service to tell a contact about
								our site, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as
								your contacts email address or we will ask you to consent to having your contact
								list(s) imported. We will send your contacts an email or instant message in your
								name inviting him or her to visit the site, and may send reminders to them. SkillPages
								stores this information to send invitations and reminders, to register a contact
								connection if your invitation is accepted, to allow you to see invitations you have
								sent and to track the success of our referral program. All information that you
								enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this privacy
								policy as cover your own information. SkillPages also stores this information (imported
								contacts information) to avoid duplication of contacts and to check when contacts,
								not invited by the User, join the SkillPages Platform through registration. SkillPages will
								also store the User’s access details in order to synch the contacts whenever the
								User logs in.

								list. When you update information, we usually keep a back-up copy of the prior version
								for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that
								information.

				<ol class="sub marginTop">
					<li>
						When you register with SkillPages, you create your own User Profile. We may occasionally
						use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services
						offered by SkillPages that we think you may find valuable.
					</li>
					<li>
						User Profile information is used by SkillPages primarily to be presented back to and
						edited by you when you access the service and to be presented to all. 
					</li>
					<li>
						The User Profile information that you submit to SkillPages will be available to all
						Users of the SkillPages Platform. All User Profile information will be available in

						engines. People who see your name in searches will be able to access your User Profile
						information without registering with the SkillPages Platform.

					<li>
						User Profile information is used by SkillPages to improve the functionality of the SkillPages Platform.

						SkillPages may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the

						Generally, you may opt out of such emails through your User Account Settings. SkillPages

					<li>
						SkillPages may use information in your User Profile without identifying you as an individual
						to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people are
						in a network like a group of electricians, and also personalising advertisements
						and promotions so that we can provide you with up to date SkillPages promotions and
						sponsors of community groupings. We believe this benefits you. We may use information
						about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers
						and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, SkillPages Platform
						developers and other Users of SkillPages, to supplement your User Profile. Where such
						information is used, we generally allow you to specify in your User Account Settings
						that you do not want this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection
						of this information to your User Profile (e.g. removing photo tag links).

					<li>
						SkillPages is about sharing catalogued skill information with Users. We do not provide
						your contact information to third-party marketers without your permission. We share
						your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe
						such sharing is (1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, (2) legally required
						or (3) permitted by you. 
					</li>
					<li>
						We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services
						we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business. In
						connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may
						have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection
						with these business activities. Where we utilise third parties for the processing
						of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections
						limiting the use of that information to the SkillPages-specified purposes. This site
						uses various analytics services to monitor and improve the quality and usability
						of the SkillPages Platform.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you, your contacts or members of your community network use any third-party applications
						developed using the SkillPages Platform (“Platform Applications”), those Platform Applications
						may access and share certain information about you with others. You may opt out
						of any sharing of certain or all information through Platform Applications. In addition,
						third-party developers who have created and operate Platform Applications (“Platform
						Developers”), may also have access to your personal information (including your
						contact information) if you permit Platform Applications to access your data. Before
						allowing any Platform Developer to make any Platform Application available to you,
						SkillPages requires the Platform Developer to enter into an agreement which, among other
						things, requires them to respect your privacy settings and strictly limits their
						collection, use and storage of your information. However, while we have undertaken
						contractual and technical steps to restrict possible misuse of such information
						by such Platform Developers, we cannot and do not guarantee that all Platform Developers
						will abide by such agreements. Please note that SkillPages does not screen or approve
						Platform Developers and cannot control how such Platform Developers use any personal
						information that they may obtain in connection with Platform Applications. In addition,
						Platform Developers may require you to sign up to their own terms of service, privacy
						policies or other policies, which may give them additional rights or impose additional
						obligations on you. 
					</li>
					<li>
						We may be required to disclose User information pursuant to lawful requests, such
						as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal
						information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law
						enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally,
						we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply
						with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal
						activity perpetrated through the SkillPages service or using the SkillPages name, or to
						prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies,
						lawyers, agents or government agencies.
					</li>
					<li>
						We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers
						through on-site offers.
					</li>
					<li>
						You can share your SkillPages information with outside applications and websites to
						make your experiences on those applications and websites better and more commercial.
					</li>
					<li>
						We are not responsible for any third party applications and websites that you interact
						with through the SkillPages Platform. 
					</li>
					<li>
						If you allow an application or website to connect with your SkillPages account, that
						application or website can access information on SkillPages related to you and your
						contacts and generate and publish stories about actions you take on that application
						or website without any additional permission. An application or website that you
						connect with can generally access the same information that you can see about yourself
						and your contacts, and an application or website that your contacts connect with
						can access the same information about you that the contacts can see.
					</li>
					<li>
						You can report any suspected misuse of the SkillPages Platform to us, and we will investigate
						the claim and take appropriate action.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the ownership of all or substantially all of the SkillPages business, or individual
						business units owned by SkillPages Holdings Limited, were to change, your User information
						may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any
						such transfer of information, your User information would remain subject to the

				<div class="borderBottomGray">THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING</div>
				<p>
					Advertisements that appear on SkillPages are sometimes delivered (or “served”) directly

					when this happens. These third-party advertisers may also download cookies to your
					computer or use other technologies such as JavaScript and “web beacons” (also known
					as “1x1 gifs”) to measure the effectiveness of their adverts and to personalise
					advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognise your
					computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness
					of their adverts and to personalise advertising content. In this way, they may compile
					information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements
					and determine which advertisements are clicked. SkillPages does not have access to or
					control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party advertisers.
				</p>
				<p>
					This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by SkillPages and does not cover the use

					Settings. Removed information may persist in back-up copies for a reasonable period
					of time but will not be generally available to Users of SkillPages.

					Where you make use of the communication features of the service to share information
