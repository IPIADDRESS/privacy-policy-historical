	<p>Skillsoft Limited and its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Skillsoft") are committed to respecting your privacy. This privacy policy and statement of cookie use (the "Privacy Policy") discloses our privacy practices and expresses our commitment to keeping you informed of the information we collect and how it is used. We ask that you take time to read it carefully. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect new uses, rules, regulations or technologies that impact your privacy.

The Web Site includes certain pages hosted by third party service providers, such as Skillsoft's Investor Relations page, <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=90584&amp;p=irol-irhome">http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=90584&amp;p=irol-irhome</a>, which are branded to look like <a href="http://www.skillsoft.com">www.skillsoft.com</a> and collect personally identifiable information and perform other tasks on behalf of Skillsoft ("Branded Sites"). These Branded Sites are governed by this Privacy Policy. Please read this Privacy Policy in its entirety. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY, THEN DO NOT USE THIS WEB SITE. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the terms of use for the Web Site <a href="http://www.skillsoft.com/terms.asp">www.skillsoft.com/terms.asp</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Skillsoft Corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Skillsoft Limited and is the entity that primarily controls the Web Site. Skillsoft Corporation has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this Privacy Policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html">TRUSTe's program requirements</a> including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personally identifiable information. TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions.

	<p>Skillsoft complies with the U.S. - E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of data from the European Union and Switzerland, respectively.

	<p>2. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW IT IS USED</p>
	
	<p>You make the decision whether or not to proceed with any activity that requests personally identifiable information, but please be aware that if you choose not to provide the information requested, you may not be able to complete certain transactions with Skillsoft.</p>
	
	<p>Sometimes, such as when you register for a service, order a product or make other requests or inquiries, we will ask for specific information about you in order to provide that product or service to you or respond to your requests or inquiries. We may collect certain personally identifiable information such as contact information, including name, e-mail address, work and home telephone numbers, fax number and a physical postal address. We may also collect information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, past experience with Skillsoft products and services, detailed contact preferences or other personally identifiable information. We may use any information that we collect, including personally identifiable information, to tailor subsequent communications to you, including marketing and promotional communications, to administer and operate the Web Site and our business and to provide and continually improve Skillsoft offerings. We may also share information that we collect, including personally identifiable information, with resellers or other third parties in order to market Skillsoft products and/or services to you. We do, however, provide our users a choice as to whether or not they would like to receive marketing or promotional communications. Please see Section 3, Choice.</p>
	
	<p>Users may from time to time receive up-to-date information on products and services via our e-mail newsletter. Users may opt-out at any time from receiving these communications. Please see Section 3, Choice.</p>
	
	<p>We may also periodically conduct business and individual user surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve our products and services. Participation in such surveys is completely voluntary and you, therefore, have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Any personally identifiable information submitted in response to a survey will remain strictly confidential, subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
	
	<p>Data you submit online may also be combined with other information you provide through other means of communication, such as postal mail.</p>
	
	<p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, referring pages, date/time stamp and click stream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Web Site, to track users' movements around the Web Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>
	
	<p>We provide access to a chat function. If you use our chat function to discuss issues with our sales team, you will be directed to a third party host to facilitate the chat. This Privacy Policy governs the collection and use of information collected within the chat area and via other online forums made available on the Web Site.</p>
	
	<p>If you choose to register for one of our Webinars, you will be directed to either a third party site such as regform.com or a Skillsoft maintained site. However, please note that our Privacy Policy only governs the collection and use of the data collected on the Web Site.</p>
	
	<p>Our Web Site includes social media features, such as the Facebook "Like" button Widgets and the "Share" button. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Web Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Web Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
	
	<p>We provide online training services to employers and individuals through our Skillport training portal. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through the Skillport training portal, which is instead governed by a separate Skillport privacy policy found at <a href="http://www.skillport.com/skillport_privacy_policy.html">http://www.skillport.com/skillport_privacy_policy.html</a>.</p>
	
	<p>A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT COOKIES</p>
	
	<p>Some pages of the Web Site use cookies. Cookies are small pieces of software which are issued to your computer or device and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the site. Our cookies are not used to collect or store personally identifiable information. By using the Web Site you consent to our use of cookies as explained below.</p>
	
	<p>Most of our cookies are necessary for operation of the Web Site or service that you request as a user of the Web Site, such as to remember text you may have entered when you navigate back to a page in the same session. We also use cookies to provide optional features and functionality that you may access on the Web Site. For example, a cookie can help us identify whether you have downloaded software in the past that allows you to access a white paper so that you won't have to download it again. We use cookies to customize and personalize the Web Site based on preferences you may have expressed either directly by selecting an option or setting or indirectly by your prior use. We also use cookies that collect information about how you use the Web Site to analyze and optimize the performance of the Web Site in order to give you a better user experience. In some cases, particularly with respect to measuring and analyzing performance of the Web Site, cookies may be placed by our third party service providers.</p>
	
	<p>We and our third party partners may also employ web beacons or clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs), images and scripts that help better manage content on the Web Site. Web beacons are tiny, clear graphics that are embedded invisibly on web pages. They are used to understand and monitor online movements of users so that we may better understand and improve their experiences on the Web Site. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are not stored on a user's computer or device. We do not tie the information gathered to your personally identifiable information.</p>
	
	<p>We partner with a third party ad network to either display our advertising on our Web Site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies, scripts and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking: <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/">http://preferences.truste.com/</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising, which means that you will continue to receive generic ads. </p>
	
	<p>When you click on a link to an external web site or third party resource (including embedded widgets similar those provided by Facebook and Twitter), the third party may place a cookie from its own site.

Skillsoft will only share the personally identifiable information you provide online with other Skillsoft affiliates, resellers or other marketers of Skillsoft's products, Skillsoft's partners and/or service providers who may be used to ship products, provide technical support, handle order processing, or otherwise act on Skillsoft's behalf for the purpose of marketing and providing Skillsoft products and services, administering and operating the Web Site and our business and sending marketing and promotional communications.

	<p>Please remember that when you submit information to a discussion group or some other public or online forum, the information submitted will be deemed public information and will not be considered confidential or treated by Skillsoft as other personally identifiable information you specifically provide to Skillsoft, which is subject to this Privacy Policy. To request removal of your personally identifiable information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="http://www.skillsoft.com/email_prefs.asp">http://www.skillsoft.com/email_prefs.asp</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personally identifiable information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
	
	<p>Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your personally identifiable information private and will not share it with third parties not acting on our behalf, unless such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with legal process (such as a court order) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority; (b) protect our rights or property; (c) protect the interest of users of the Web Site, other than you, or any other person; or (d) operate or conduct maintenance and repair of our services or equipment, as authorized by law.</p>
