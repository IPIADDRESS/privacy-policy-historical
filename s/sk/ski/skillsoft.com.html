                              but please be aware that if you choose not to provide 
                              the information requested, you may not be able to 
                              complete certain transactions with SkillSoft.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes, such as when you register for a service, 
                              order a product, or make other inquiries, we will 
                              ask for specific information about you in order 
                              to provide that product or service to you. We will 
                              need certain personally identifiable information 
                              such as name, contact and billing information.</p>
                            <p>In order to tailor subsequent communications to 
                              you and to continually improve SkillSoft offerings, 
                              we may also ask you to provide information regarding 
                              your personal or professional interests, demographics, 
                              past experience with SkillSoft products and services, 
                              and detailed contact preferences. We do, however, 
                              provide our users a choice as to whether or not 
                              they would like to receive these communications.

                            <p>Users may from time to time receive up-to-date 
                              information on products and services via our e-mail 
                              newsletter. Again, out of respect for your privacy, 
                              we give users the choice to opt-in to receiving 
                              these communications. Please see our Choice and

                            <p>We may also periodically conduct business and individual 
                              user surveys because they provide us with important 
                              information that helps us to improve our products 
                              and services. Participation in such surveys is completely 
                              voluntary and you, therefore, have a choice whether 
                              or not to disclose this information. Any personal 
                              information submitted in response to a survey will 
                              remain strictly confidential.</p>
                            <p>Data you submit online may also be combined with 
                              other information you provide through other means 
                              of communication, such as postal mail.</p>

                              server to your browser. This file contains information 
                              that may later be read back by the Web server for

                              on the Web and can improve the service a Web site 
                              provides to you because content can be prepared 
                              to suit your preferences. Cookies are useful, for 
                              example, to facilitate a regular visitor’s use of 
                              a site by eliminating the need to repeatedly type 
                              in a password, and to store preferences on a personalized 
                              site. This type of information is not used to personally 
                              identify an individual, and you remain anonymous. 
                              You may modify your browser to reject cookies or 
                              to notify you whenever a cookie is sent to your 
                              hard drive. If you reject a cookie sent by SkillSoft, 
                              you may still access the site, but such access may 
                              be limited.</p>
