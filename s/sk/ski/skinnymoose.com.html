<p>We, our service providers and third party advertising partners use technologies that automatically collect information about Site visitors.</p>

<p>We automatically collect information about how you access, navigate and leave our Site, including the website you came from before visiting our Site, what browser type and operating system you are using, the internet protocol (IP) address you are accessing the Site from, your mobile device ID or Advertising ID if you visit our Site from a mobile device, the pages of our Site that you are navigating through, the date and time of your visit, how long you spend on our Site or certain pages of our Site, and what website you go to after visiting our Site. This information may be used to determine how many visitors visit our Site or certain areas of our Site, how long they remain on our Site, whether they use the hyperlinks we provide or respond to advertising and to tailor our advertisements to you. We may share this information with partners who referred you to our Site, and with advertising partners, who may use the information to optimize the traffic they send to us and for delivering targeted ads to you when you visit other websites.</p>

<p>We, our service providers and third-party advertising partners collect information about Site visitors using cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels and Adobe Flash). We use these technologies to remember your preferences and facilitate your navigation of our Site. We and our service providers and third-party advertising partners also use these technologies to track your activities on our Site and other websites, including the websites and web pages that you visited, the ads or content that you clicked on and the search terms you used, in order to deliver tailored advertising to you. We may also share a hashed or encrypted version of your email address or telephone number with advertising partners so that you may be served with tailored advertising on our websites or other third party websites. These advertising partners are not permitted to use your hashed or encrypted email address for any other purpose.</p>

<p>If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject any cookies. You may also set your e-mail options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our e-mail and performed certain functions with it. If you donât want us to share your hashed or encrypted email address with advertising partners, simply opt-out of our promotional communications. See Your Choices below.</p>

<p>At this time, we do not respond to browser "do not track" signals. However, you may also opt-out of network advertising programs that track your activities across multiple websites to deliver personalized advertising content to you. Please visit <a href="http://youradchoices.ca/understanding-online-advertising" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada Opt-Out Page</a>, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">NAI Opt-Out Page</a> and the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">Ad Choices Opt-Out Page</a>.</p>

<h3><span id="how-we-share">&nbsp;</span>4. How we share your information</h3>

<p>We may share information we collect about you in the following circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Advertising partners</strong></p>
<p>We share information with our third-party advertising partners as described in the Cookies, tracking technologies and interest-based advertising section above.</p>

<p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
<p>We may use service providers (including affiliates acting in this capacity) to provide services to us or to you on our behalf. For example, our service providers may host our Site, analyze data collected from our Site, provide customer service on our behalf, administer our promotions, facilitate and process transactions and payments, provide marketing or promotional assistance, distribute emails and other communications, post our advertisements (including online through targeted advertising campaigns), and collect your feedback on our Site and advertisements. We share your personal information with our service providers solely for the purposes of providing services to you and to us. They are not permitted to use your personal information for other purposes. Some of our service providers are located outside of Canada, including in the United States. While your personal information is located outside Canada it will be subject to legal requirements applicable to our service providers, for example, lawful requirements to disclose personal information to national security agencies or government authorities in certain circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Aggregate or de-identified information</strong></p>
<p>We may use your personal information to create aggregate statistics and de-identified data. We may use, share and sell this information for any purpose.</p>

<p><strong>With your consent</strong></p>
<p>We may share your personal information with third parties with your consent. For example, if you provide us with your contact information, such as an e-mail address, for the purposes of signing up for information, newsletters, contests, or marketing offers from a third party, or for receiving business offers or service quotes from a third party, we may share your personal information for that purpose. Once shared, your personal information will be subject to the privacy policy of that third party.</p>


<p><strong>Business Transactions</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose personal information to third parties in connection with the proposed or actual financing, securitization, insuring, sale, assignment or other disposal of all or part of Carbon Media or our business or assets. These third parties may use the information, for the purposes of evaluating and/or completing the proposed transaction. We will use reasonable efforts to ensure that our successors or assigns process the information we transfer to them in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information in other circumstances where permitted or required by law or other legal process. For example, we may disclose your personal information: (a) to collect a debt owed to us; (b) as necessary to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order or other legal process; (c) if disclosure is requested by an investigatory body, law enforcement official or governmental authority which has lawful authority to request the disclosure of the information in respect of an investigation or other legal process; or (d) if we have reasonable grounds to believe that the information relates to a breach of an agreement or contravention of a law, or to protect the personal safety of our users or defend our rights or property.</p>


<h3><span id="how-we-store">&nbsp;</span>5. How we store and protect personal information</h3>
<p>Personal information is maintained on our servers (or those of our service providers). In an effort to protect your personal information against unauthorized access or disclosure. For example, accounts you create on our Sites are password protected. In identified parts of our Sites, we use SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions. We limit access to personal information to employees, representatives and service providers who require access in connection with their job responsibilities. Please note it is not possible to transmit data with absolute security over the internet, and we cannot and do not guarantee the security of your personal information.</p>



<h3><span id="external-content">&nbsp;</span>6. Links to external content</h3>
<p>Our Site may link or direct you to other websites, services or external content provided by third parties. We do not exercise any control over these third party websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third party websites or services. We recommend that you read the privacy policy for any third party website that you visit or service that you use.</p>


<h3><span id="children">&nbsp;</span>7. Children</h3>
<p>Our Sites are not directed to and we do not knowingly request or collect personal information from children - persons under 13 years of age, or another age if required by applicable law - without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personal information about a child without verifiable parental consent, we will delete this information from our records or, if that is not reasonable, we will take reasonable available steps to de-identify the information.</p>
