may collect </span></b></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">You are
able to take advantage of many of <span class="spelle">Bonnier's</span> products,
services, and websites without providing any information that personally
identifies you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We only collect
personally-identifying information when you voluntarily submit it to us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">Sometimes,
we need personally-identifying information in order to provide you with the
products and services that you request.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Depending upon the product or service, we may ask you for a variety of
personally-identifying information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
might include, for example, your name, address, e-mail address, telephone
number, gender, and <span class="spelle">birth date</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We may also ask for other information about
you, such as your credit card information (when you are making a purchase),
interests, income, or education level.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We consider certain identifying information "sensitive."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This includes your credit card number, income
level, or any other information that would normally be considered confidential.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">You may
choose not to provide us with any personally-identifying information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, you can still access and use
many portions of <span class="spelle">Bonnier's</span> websites; however, you
will not be able to access and use those portions of any <span class="grame">Bonnier</span>
website that require your personal information.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">Many
Bonnier websites include community features, such as online forums and message
boards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Information that is posted in
these areas becomes public information and the use that any third party makes
of this information is beyond our ability to control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You should exercise caution before disclosing
any personally-identifying information in these public venues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you elect to submit content that includes
information that can be used to identify you, you must assume that the content
can and will be displayed on any website on the Internet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">At some <span class="grame">Bonnier</span> sites and through certain promotions, you can submit
personally-identifying information about other people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, you might submit a person's name
and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card; or, if you order a gift
online or offline and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit
the recipient's name and address.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some
Bonnier websites also provide referral services to help you inform a friend
about our websites, products, or services.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The types of personally-identifying information that we collect about
other people at pages like these may include the person's name, address, e-mail
address, or telephone number.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We will
only ask you for the information about your friend that we need in order to do
what you request.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">In some
circumstances, we also collect non-personally-identifying information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When you visit a <span class="grame">Bonnier</span>
website, we may collect information such as the type of browser you use, your
operating system, your IP address, and the domain name of your Internet Service
Provider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This information, by itself,
does not permit individual identification, meaning that you will remain
anonymous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, if you elect to
provide us with personally-identifying information during your visit, that
information may be linked to your IP address.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">When you
visit our websites, we may send one or more cookies – small, removable data
files – to your computer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We use cookies
to uniquely identify your browser, which allows us to enhance and personalize
your online experience at <span class="grame">Bonnier</span> websites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, cookies allow us to recognize
you when you return to a website and present relevant content to you when you
visit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most browsers are initially set
up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to warn you when
cookies are sent, or to refuse all cookies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some of the features and services of <span class="grame">Bonnier</span>
websites may not operate properly if your cookies are disabled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">Cookies, by
themselves, do not provide us with any personally-identifying information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="grame">However, if you elect to
provide us with personally-identifying information during your visit, that
information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">On our
websites, we may also use tiny graphic images called pixel tags, web beacons,
or clear gifs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These tiny images help us
to analyze our users' online behavior and collect other data, such as page
views or advertising responses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pixel
tags also allow us to send you e-mail in a format that you can read, and let us
know when you have opened an e-mail message from us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pixel tags may also be used to deliver
cookies.</span></p>

the third-party sponsors' use of this information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a third-party sponsor beyond our control
will obtain information that you supply us, we will notify you at the time we
collect the information from you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
certain promotions, only those who provide us with the requested
personally-identifying information will be able to order products, programs,

websites contain links to other sites.<span style="">&nbsp;
