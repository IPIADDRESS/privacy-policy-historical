            <p>At @Last Software, Inc. (“@Last”), we take our customers’ privacy
              very seriously. Therefore, we want to provide you with explicit
              information regarding how we collect, gather, and identify information
              during your visit to this site. This information may be expanded
              or updated as we modify our site.&nbsp; We recommend that you review
              this policy from time to time to see if it has changed so that
              you can remain informed about what information we collect, how
              we use it and when and how we disclose it. </p>
            <p><strong>What Organization Is Collecting the Information.</strong><br>
  @Last Software, Inc. owns and operates the www.sketchup.com web site and is
    the company that collects personal information governed by this privacy policy.&nbsp; All
    information will be collected and stored in the United States.&nbsp; Our
    mailing address is 821 Pearl Street, Boulder, CO 80302, our telephone number
    is 303-245-0086, and our general information email address is <a href="mailto:info@sketchup.com">info@sketchup.com</a>.&nbsp; @Last
    Software will own all information that it collects.</p>
            <p><strong>How we gather information about our customers:</strong><br>
  We collect information about our customers through a variety of methods. These
    methods include forms on our Web site, our software or service registration
    and licensing procedures, attendance or participation in product training
    or trade show events that @Last participates in, industry groups and organizations
    and publications, and through direct communication such as phone conversations. </p>
            <p>In our effort to provide you with products or services we may
              at times ask you to submit information about yourself. You never
              have to answer these questions. However, if you should elect to
              withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you
              with some of these services dependent upon the collection of this
              information. </p>
            <p>Some of our web pages use "cookies" so that we can better
              serve you with tailored information when you return to our site.
              Cookies are identifiers that a web site can send to your browser
              and are stored on your computer to facilitate your next visit to
              our site. It may do such things as store the fact that you have
              registered for a seminar so that the next time you visit the site
              we recognize you as a previous registrant. We may also use clear
              GIFs on some pages within the our web site.&nbsp; Clear GIFs and
              cookies make your internet experience quicker and more convenient.
              You can, if you wish, set your browser to notify you when you are
              sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to
              accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If
              you do so, however, some areas of our site may not function properly.</p>
            <p><strong>How we use information about our customers:</strong><br>
  We may use your information on an aggregated basis to do such things as operate
    our site, enhance our site, and sell and deliver advertising.&nbsp; We may
    also use this data, both aggregated and personally identifiable, to deliver
    products and services, detect use of our software, deliver informational
    and promotional electronic mail, to make sales calls, and enhance your on-site
    experience by displaying content and marketing messages that we believe will
    be of interest to you.</p>
            <p><strong>Submissions:</strong><br>
  @Last welcomes customer input and feedback and provides various services whereby
    such information can be made available to users of our Web services, such
    as FAQ’s, Tips and Tricks, Case Studies, User Gallery and other services.
    Any user material, information or other communication transmitted or posted
    to our Web sites or services, or otherwise provided to @Last ("Submission")
    is understood by both parties to be non-confidential and non-proprietary.
    @Last has no obligation with respect to any Submission and may freely copy,
    reproduce, incorporate, distribute or use such Submission as it wishes. Submissions
    that are pornographic, violent, obscene, threatening, defamatory, libelous
    or violate the law in any way, are strictly prohibited. </p>
            <p><strong>Protection of User Information:</strong><br>
  @Last will not monitor, edit or disclose information about a user or a user's
    private content, except where @Last may do so in the good faith belief that
    such action is reasonably necessary: (1) to comply with the law; (2) to comply
    with legal process; (3) to enforce the Terms; (4) to respond to claims that
    such content violates the rights of third parties; (5) to protect the interests
    of @Last or others. All material submitted to our web sites and services,
    regardless of form or medium, becomes the property of @Last. </p>
            <p>@Last does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third
              parties. @Last may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of
              external business partners about a particular offering that we
              feel may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally
              identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number)
              is not transferred to the third party. &nbsp;Notwithstanding the
              foregoing, you acknowledge that if @Last is acquired, the company’s
              assets and all customer information in its possession will become
              the property of the acquiring company.</p>
            <p>@Last may provide your personal information (including credit
              card information) to @Last's agents for purposes of processing
              and/or fulfillment of transactions, including product orders that
              are conducted through this site. </p>
            <p><strong>Control of Your Personal Information:</strong><br>
  As a valued customer, @Last offers you the choice to “opt-out” of
  receiving certain marketing communications. You may stop the delivery of future
  informational or promotional e-mail from @Last by following the specific instructions
  in the e-mail you receive. The instructions explain how to stop receiving such
  e-mails. Please note that due to lead times on certain mailings and other contacts,
  you may continue to receive contacts for a period following your "opt
  out" notification. </p>
            <p>@Last wants to ensure that the information it collects from its
              customers is accurate. Please notify us of any change to your address,
              phone number, email address or other information by sending us
              an email message at <a href="mailto:privacy@sketchup.com">privacy@sketchup.com</a> or
              by notifying us in writing at:</p>
            <p>@Last Software, Inc <br>

  303-245-0086<br>
  Attn: Legal Department</p>
            <p><strong>General Notices:</strong><br>
  We may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service issues,
    product surveys, new feature announcements and news about our products and
    services. These e-mails are considered essential to the provision of the
    service you have requested. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe
    to these mailings as they are considered a part of the service you have chosen. </p>
            <p><strong>Security of your Personal Information:</strong><br>
  We have established and maintain reasonable security procedures to protect
    the confidentiality, security and integrity of your personally identifiable
    information.&nbsp; “Perfect security,” however, does not exist
    on the Internet.</p>
            <p>Although your privacy is very important to us, due to the existing
              legal regulatory and security environment, we cannot fully ensure
              that your private communications and other personally identifiable
              information will not be disclosed to third parties.&nbsp; For example,
              we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third
              parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully
              intercept or access transmissions or private communications.&nbsp; Additionally,
              in the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible
              problems or inquiries, we can (and you authorize us to do so) disclose
              any information about you to private entities, law enforcement
              or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe
              necessary or appropriate.</p>
            <p><strong>Protecting Children:</strong><br>
  @Last is committed to the safety of our children. @Last products are not marketed
    to anyone under the age of 18 years old (a “Minor”) and @Last
    does not knowingly collect personal information from Minors. @Last is committed
    to protecting the privacy of minors and if it becomes aware that such information
    was collected, it will treat that information as sensitive. Minors may not
    participate in any discussion boards, sweepstakes or contests, nor make any
    public postings or submissions on our Web site except through their parents
    or teachers.&nbsp; Students Minors seeking to participate in contents are
    required to do so through their parents or teachers, and, should the submission
    be displayed on our Web site their personal information will be limited for
    their protection.</p>
