The information used to personalise adverts you see may include your details of what you've searched for on Skyscanner or general location information at a city or airport level, but will never include your name, contact details or other information that would enable you to be identified in the offline world. If you want to manage how your information is used for advertising purposes, you can find out more below and in our \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.skyscanner.net\u002Fmedia\u002Fcookie-policy\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ECookie Policy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.","more":"Learn more about how your information is used for advertising","subsections":[{"title":"Adverts you might see whilst using Skyscanner","description":["You'll often see adverts while using our services. These will either be delivered by us directly or by third party advertising solution providers we partner with (let's call them \"Third Party Ad Solutions\").","The majority of these adverts will be personalised to make them relevant to you and will fall into two different categories. Firstly, adverts that are personalised for you based either on contextual information that is specific to something you may be looking at or have searched for but which is not linked to you as an individual (for example, if you have searched for a flight to London this search data will be reflected in the URL of the results page you have landed on, and this data within the URL may then be used by us to decide to include an advert relating to a hotel in London within that webpage) or on information collected by us or by Third Party Ad Solutions whilst you use our services, such as your general location (by city or country) and your Skyscanner searches or booking history (\"Skyscanner-related Information\"). So, for example, if you've booked a flight to Rome, you'll see adverts about hotels in Rome, rather than hotels in Paris (Paris is lovely, but this could be a bit annoying!). Skyscanner-related Information will never include your name, contact details or other information that would enable you to be identified in the offline world. Secondly, adverts that are personalised for you based on information that we have no visibility or control over, and which is instead collected from you by Third Party Solutions when you have been using other non-Skyscanner websites or platforms (\"non-Skyscanner Platforms\"). Collectively, we refer to these as \"interest-based\" advertisements.","The information required to deliver these interest-based advertisements will be stored by Third Party Ad Solutions alongside your IP address and\u002For a cookie ID, so that you can be served the adverts without the Third Party Ad Solutions needing to store any information that would enable you to be identified in the offline world, like your name or address.","When you are opted-in to ads personalisation we may also use information we collect via cookies and similar technologies to show you personalised ads, marketing and promotions on Skyscanner, or to send you communications where you have opted in to receive these. For example, where you book a flight using Skyscanner or redirect from Skyscanner to make a booking on one of our partner sites, we may use the information we collect via cookies and similar technologies to personalise the ads we show you or to send you personalised marketing communications relevant to your booking based on information like your destination, the time you are travelling, the services you've selected or which travel supplier you are travelling with.

For example, this would happen where a non-Skyscanner Platform that you use makes advertising space available for sale and Skyscanner, or a Third Party Ad Solution that we work with, purchases that space. Similar to the adverts you see whilst using Skyscanner, these adverts may be personalised and served to you because of information that Third Party Ad Solutions have collected about you, either when you were using our services or when you were using other non-Skyscanner Platforms. For example, if you have searched for a flight from Edinburgh to London on Skyscanner or another non-Skyscanner Platform, and we have asked Third Party Ad Solution to show our advert to individuals that have expressed an interest in travelling to London, the Third Party Ad Solution may categorise you within that group and serve you our advert."},{"title":"How can I control the adverts I see?","description":"You can find information about how to tailor your advertising preferences in our \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.skyscanner.net\u002Fmedia\u002Fcookie-policy\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ECookie Policy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

These will either be delivered by us directly or by third party advertising solution providers we partner with (let's call them "Third Party Ad Solutions").</p><p class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--base__1hTVF Content_Content__description__1_uIJ">The majority of these adverts will be personalised to make them relevant to you and will fall into two different categories. Firstly, adverts that are personalised for you based either on contextual information that is specific to something you may be looking at or have searched for but which is not linked to you as an individual (for example, if you have searched for a flight to London this search data will be reflected in the URL of the results page you have landed on, and this data within the URL may then be used by us to decide to include an advert relating to a hotel in London within that webpage) or on information collected by us or by Third Party Ad Solutions whilst you use our services, such as your general location (by city or country) and your Skyscanner searches or booking history ("Skyscanner-related Information"). So, for example, if you've booked a flight to Rome, you'll see adverts about hotels in Rome, rather than hotels in Paris (Paris is lovely, but this could be a bit annoying!). Skyscanner-related Information will never include your name, contact details or other information that would enable you to be identified in the offline world. Secondly, adverts that are personalised for you based on information that we have no visibility or control over, and which is instead collected from you by Third Party Solutions when you have been using other non-Skyscanner websites or platforms ("non-Skyscanner Platforms"). Collectively, we refer to these as "interest-based" advertisements.</p><p class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--base__1hTVF Content_Content__description__1_uIJ">The information required to deliver these interest-based advertisements will be stored by Third Party Ad Solutions alongside your IP address and/or a cookie ID, so that you can be served the adverts without the Third Party Ad Solutions needing to store any information that would enable you to be identified in the offline world, like your name or address.</p><p class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--base__1hTVF Content_Content__description__1_uIJ">When you are opted-in to ads personalisation we may also use information we collect via cookies and similar technologies to show you personalised ads, marketing and promotions on Skyscanner, or to send you communications where you have opted in to receive these. For example, where you book a flight using Skyscanner or redirect from Skyscanner to make a booking on one of our partner sites, we may use the information we collect via cookies and similar technologies to personalise the ads we show you or to send you personalised marketing communications relevant to your booking based on information like your destination, the time you are travelling, the services you've selected or which travel supplier you are travelling with. We may also use this information to provide you with relevant information about the destination you are travelling to such as City Guides or up to date weather information or to request reviews and recommendations about the places you have visited.</p></div><div class="Content_Content__2CUaO"><h3 class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--base__1hTVF Content_Content__title__1B6Yq">Adverts you might see whilst on non-Skyscanner platforms</h3><p class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--base__1hTVF Content_Content__description__1_uIJ">You might also see adverts for our services once you've left Skyscanner and are using non-Skyscanner websites. For example, this would happen where a non-Skyscanner Platform that you use makes advertising space available for sale and Skyscanner, or a Third Party Ad Solution that we work with, purchases that space. Similar to the adverts you see whilst using Skyscanner, these adverts may be personalised and served to you because of information that Third Party Ad Solutions have collected about you, either when you were using our services or when you were using other non-Skyscanner Platforms. For example, if you have searched for a flight from Edinburgh to London on Skyscanner or another non-Skyscanner Platform, and we have asked Third Party Ad Solution to show our advert to individuals that have expressed an interest in travelling to London, the Third Party Ad Solution may categorise you within that group and serve you our advert.</p></div><div class="Content_Content__2CUaO"><h3 class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--base__1hTVF Content_Content__title__1B6Yq">How can I control the adverts I see?</h3><p class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--base__1hTVF Content_Content__description__1_uIJ">You can find information about how to tailor your advertising preferences in our <a href="https://www.skyscanner.net/media/cookie-policy" target="_blank">Cookie Policy</a>. You can opt-out of your information being used for advertising purposes by deselecting the "Personalise my Ads" option accessible at www.skyscanner.net/privacy-settings or via the Privacy Settings option in the Skyscanner app. This will stop your information being used for advertising purposes by any of the Third Party Ad Solutions. When you opt-out of or block interest-based advertising that's delivered by Third Party Ad Solutions, you'll no longer receive advertisements from those Third Party Ad solutions on Skyscanner or on other websites as you move around web.
