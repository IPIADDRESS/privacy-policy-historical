<p>• rotect your, Skype and the eBay Group’s interests, including in particular to enforce our Terms of Service and fight against fraud,</p>

<p>(together, the <strong>Purposes</strong>).</p>

<p><strong><a name="4"></a>4. TO WHOM DOES SKYPE TRANSFER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, Skype shall not sell, rent, trade or otherwise transfer any personal and/or traffic data or communications content to any third party without your explicit permission, unless it is obliged to do so under applicable laws or by order of the competent authorities.</p>
<p>Skype may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, to protect Skype and eBay Group’s interests, to enforce our policies or to protect anyone's rights, property, or safety.</p>
<p>Skype may share your information with the eBay Group for certain purposes, and in particular insofar as necessary to (1) provide and invoice certain joint services (such as registration, transactions and customer support); (2) organise marketing or promotional operations, contests, games and similar events; and (3) fight against fraud.</p>

<p>In order to provide you with Skype products you have requested, Skype may sometimes, if necessary, share your personal and traffic data with carriers, partner service providers and/or agents, for example the PSTN-VoIP gateway provider, Wifi access services providers, distributors of Skype software and/or Skype products, and/or the third party banking organizations or other providers of payment, email delivery, analytical services, customer support, or hosting services. Skype will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation. </p>

<p>Some Skype products may be co-branded and offered together with or via a  partner company. If you register for or use such products, you consent to both Skype and the partner company’s use of personal data collected in connection with the co-branded product.</p>

<p>If you are a member of the Business Control Panel, detailed information about the activity on your Skype account including traffic data and details of your purchases and downloads may be accessed by the Administrator of the Business Control Panel if you have agreed to such access. You can withdraw your agreement at any time by changing the settings on your account page on www.skype.com. If you provide personal data including your name and job title to be included on the Business Control Panel directory, you acknowledge that such data may be viewed by other members of that Business Control Panel.</p>

<p>Skype, Skype's local partner, or the operator or company facilitating your communication may provide personal data, communications content and/or traffic data to an appropriate authority lawfully requesting such information. Skype will provide all reasonable assistance and information to fulfil this request and you hereby consent to such disclosure</p>

<p>Your information may be stored and processed in any country in which Skype and the eBay Group maintain facilities, including outside of the EU. In this regard, or for purposes of sharing or disclosing data in accordance with this article 4, Skype reserves the right to transfer information outside of your country. By using Skype software, Skype's websites or Skype products you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. As Skype continues to develop its business, Skype might sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions as well as in the event Skype or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal information of Skype users will generally be one of the transferred business assets. We reserve the right to include your personal information, collected as an asset, in any such transfer to a third party.</p>

<p><strong><a name="5"></a>5. WHAT ARE COOKIES AND GIFS HOW DOES SKYPE USE THEM?</strong></p>

<p>Cookies are pieces of information that the Skype software may store on your computer's hard drive in order to help web applications to recognize you or your or preferences. Skype also uses cookies embedded in the browser of the Skype software client. Skype's cookies may contain identifying information. Cookies enable Skype to gain information about the use of its websites. This information may be analyzed by third parties on our behalf.</p>

<p>Please bear in mind that some personalized services may not be available if you choose to disable cookies.</p>

<p>Clear Gifs</p>

<p>Skype web pages may include clear gifs. Clear gifs (also known as web-beacons) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, which are used to count your visits to the page (but which do not retain any personally identifiable information). In addition, Skype uses clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened and acted upon. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>Third Party Cookies</p>
<p>The adverts appearing on our websites are delivered to you by our web advertising partners. Please be aware that these third parties may use cookies to obtain information about your visits to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an advert (but not your name, address, or other personal information).This information is used to serve adverts to you.</p>

<p><strong><a name="6"></a>6. YOUR USER PROFILE</strong></p>

<p><strong><a name="7"></a>7. LINKED WEBSITES AND THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS</strong></p>
<p>Skype websites may contain links that will let you leave Skype's website and access another website. Linked websites are not under the control of Skype and it is possible that these websites have a different privacy policy.

Skype accepts no responsibility or liability for these other websites.</p>

<p>If you use any extras, plug-ins or third party applications together with the Skype software (“Applications”), the provider of such Applications may obtain access to certain personal information about you. Skype does not and cannot control how the provider of Applications may use any personal information connected in connection with such Applications. Please ensure that you review any privacy policies or other terms applicable to the use of such Application before installation.</p>

<p><strong><a name="8"></a>8. HOW DOES SKYPE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p>Skype and the eBay Group shall take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect the personal data and traffic data provided to it or collected by it with due observance of the applicable obligations and exceptions under the relevant legislation.

<p><strong><a name="9"></a>9. PERSONAL DATA OF FRIENDS</strong></p>

<p><strong><a name="10"></a>10. CONTACTING YOU</strong></p>
<p>Skype may from time to time ask you to provide information on your experiences which will be used to measure and improve quality. You are at no time under any obligation to provide any of such data. Any and all information which is voluntarily submitted in feedback forms on the website or any survey that you accept to take part in is used for the purposes of reviewing this feedback and improving the Skype software, Skype and eBay Group entities' products and websites.</p>

<p>Skype may contact you to send you messages about faults and service issues. Further, Skype reserves the right to use email or the Skype software to notify you of any eventual claims related to your use of Skype software, the Skype websites and/or Skype products, including without limitation claims of violation of third party rights.</p> 
<p>Skype may send you alerts by email to notify you when someone has tried to contact you. Skype may also use email or the Skype software to keep you up to date with news about the Skype software and Skype products that you have purchased and/or to inform you about other Skype or eBay Group entities' products or other Skype related information. You can opt-out of the receipt of alerts and/or promotional emails by clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ link on the email that you receive. You can also manage your communication preferences by signing into your account page on www.skype.com.</p>

<p>If you have registered for or use co-branded Skype products, the emails you receive may be from our partner company, acting on Skype’s behalf.</p>

<p><strong><a name="11"></a>11. CAN THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT BE MODIFIED?</strong></p>
<p>Skype reserves the right to modify the provisions of this Privacy Statement if deemed necessary. We will inform you of these changes by publishing the revised Privacy Statement at <a href="/go/privacy">skype.com/go/privacy</a>. The revised Privacy Statement shall become effective within thirty (30) days of such publishing, unless you expressly accept the revised statement earlier by clicking on the accept button. You agree that the express acceptance by you, or your continued use of the Skype software or Skype products after the notice period of thirty (30) days, shall constitute your acceptance of the Privacy Statement.</p>

<p><strong><a name="12"></a>12. WHAT RIGHTS DO YOU HAVE AND HOW CAN YOU CONTACT SKYPE?</strong></p>

<p>You have the right to access and, where relevant, to amend your personal information. Some of your information may be viewed or edited online by logging into your My Account page on www.skype.com.   We will respond to requests to view, correct, complete or remove your personal information  within a reasonable period of time and upon verification of your identity. Please address any questions to <a href="mailto:support@skype.net">support@skype.net</a>.</p>
<p>Skype will use its best endeavours to accommodate requests to delete personal information unless it is required to be retained by law or for lawful business purposes. However, please note that due to the technical nature of the peer to peer network, it can sometimes take up to two weeks before your Skype ID disappears completely from the peer to peer network. Your details may still appear in the search directory during this time.</p>

<p><strong><a name="13"></a>13. HOW LONG IS YOUR PERSONAL DATA KEPT BY SKYPE?</strong></p>
<p>Skype and, where relevant, the eBay Group entities will retain your information for as long as is necessary to: (1) fulfil any of the Purposes (as defined in article 3 of this Privacy Statement) or (2) comply with applicable legislation, regulatory requests and relevant orders from competent courts.</p>
<p>Retention of Instant Messages made using Skype For Your Mobile</p>
<p>If you are using Skype For Your Mobile, your chat communications content may be stored by Skype (a) to ensure the effective conveyance and synchronisation of your messages to you and other chat participants and (b) to enable you to retrieve your chat history. Chat history messages will be stored for 30 days unless you have chosen to limit the retention period by changing the settings on your mobile device. If you have disabled this option entirely, the content of multi chat messages will be still by retained by Skype until the messaged has been synchronised to all chat participants, it will then be deleted within 24 hours. In case of 1-1 chat messages, the message will be deleted within 2 hours after transmission to ensure successful synchronization. Skype will at all times take appropriate technical and security measures to protect your information. By using this product, you consent to the storage of your chat communications as described above.</p>
