<p>With your consent you will receive notice if and when information about you might be sent to third parties and you will have the opportunity to agree or refuse to agree to the sharing of your information at that time.</p>
<p>We may disclose your information as required by law, such as to comply with a witness summons, or similar legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>
<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.</p>


<h2>How Secure is the Information You Hold About Me?</h2>
<p>Our work is to ensure the protection of your information while it's being transmitted and to continue to provide a secure website and database. We maintain procedural safeguards to protect your information that is collected, stored and disclosed. It is extremely important for you to protect your user login and password from unauthorised access on the computer you use to access your SKYCIG account. Make sure to completely sign off your account when using a shared computer. SKYCIG cannot be held liable for any types of tampering, database errors or fraud.</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms or Tax ID, SSN, VAT or your paypal account information on our affiliate sign up forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
