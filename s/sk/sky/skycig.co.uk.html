<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to make it easier to navigate our website, to help protect your information and to collect information required to make it easier for us to understand what products interest our community. The help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will inform you about how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, to notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any information you submit while on our site.</p>
<p>The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>

<p> We use the following categories of cookies on our Site :</p>

<p> <strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong> <br>
These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the Site and use its features. Without these cookies, services you have asked for such as remembering your login details or shopping basket items cannot be provided. </p>
<p> <strong> Performance Cookies</strong> <br>
These cookies collect anonymous information on how people use our Site. For example, we use Google Analytics cookies to help us understand how customers arrive at our Site, browse or use our Site and highlight areas which can be improved such as navigation, shopping experience and marketing campaigns. The data stored by these cookies never shows personal details from which your individual identity can be established. </p>
<p> <strong> Functionality Cookies</strong> <br>
These cookies remember choices you make such as the country you visit our Site from, language and search parameters such as size, colour or product line. These can then be used to provide you with an experience more appropriate to your selections and to make the visits more tailored and pleasant. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. </p>
<p> <strong> Targeting cookies or advertising cookies</strong> <br>
These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising more relevant to you and your interests.

<p>By making a purchase and sharing your email address you will be entered on to our customer mailing list to receive product alerts, promotional material as well as our newsletter (unless otherwise indicated). We promise to always make these emails as interesting and relevant to you as we can but if you do not wish to receive promotional material, products alerts or our newsletter you may ask to be removed from our mailing list at any time by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each communication. Alternatively you can email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@blucigs.co.uk">privacy@blucigs.co.uk</a> and request to be removed from our lists or access your email preferences via the account area and choose what, if anything, you would like to receive.</p>
<p>With your consent you will receive notice if and when information about you might be sent to third parties and you will have the opportunity to agree or refuse to agree to the sharing of your information at that time.</p>
<p>We may disclose your information as required by law, such as to comply with a witness summons, or similar legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, reduce credit risk or respond to a government request.</p>

<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, we may disclose your personal information to the prospective buyer of such assets and you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information. <br>

<h2>How Secure is the Information You Hold About Me?</h2>
<p>Our work is to ensure the protection of your information while it's being transmitted and to continue to provide a secure website and database. We maintain procedural safeguards to protect your information that is collected, stored and disclosed. It is extremely important for you to protect your user login and password from unauthorised access on the computer you use to access your blu account. Make sure to completely sign off your account when using a shared computer. blu cannot be held liable for any types of tampering, database errors or fraud.</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms or Tax ID, SSN, VAT or your PayPal account information on our affiliate sign up forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>




<h2>Are Children Allowed to Use blu?</h2>
<p>Absolutely not! blu™ has a strict policy of selling its products to adults aged 18 years and older. If blu believes there is personal information in our hands from a person under the age of 18 years that has breached our policy, all the account information relating to this person will be deleted immediately.</p>




<h2> Where We Store Your Information </h2>
<p> We may transfer, and store, some of your personal information to countries outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff and suppliers may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. Some of these countries may not have equivalent data protection legislation regarding the use and protection of your personal information. By submitting your information to this Site, you consent to such transfers taking place.  </p>




<h2>Access to Your Information</h2>
<p>You are entitled to see the information held about you. If you wish to do this, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@blucigs.co.uk">privacy@blucigs.co.uk</a>. We may require you to provide verification of your identity and to pay an administration fee (which is currently £10) to provide a copy of the information we hold. Please note that in certain circumstances we may withhold access to your information where we have the right to do so under current data protection legislation. </p>
<p>If your information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, amend, delete inaccuracies, or update it by making the change within your account on our Site or by emailing us at any time at <a href="mailto:privacy@blucigs.co.uk">privacy@blucigs.co.uk</a>. </p>

In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. <br>
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active.  If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your personal information to provide you services contact us at the email address listed above. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
