    </strong> 
  </p>

  <p>• protect your and Skype’s interests, including in particular to enforce our Terms of Service and fight against fraud, (together, the&nbsp;Purposes).</p>  
  <p> 
    <strong> 
      <a href="" id="4" name="4" shape="rect"></a>4. OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
    </strong> 
  </p>  
  <p>Except as provided below, Skype shall not sell, rent, trade or otherwise transfer any personal and/or traffic data or communications content to any third party without your explicit permission, unless it is obliged to do so under applicable laws or by order of the competent authorities.</p>  
  <p>Skype may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, to protect Skype’s interests, to enforce our policies or to protect anyone's rights, property, or safety.</p>  
  <p>In order to provide you with Skype products you have requested, Skype may sometimes, if necessary, share your personal and traffic data with Skype’s group companies, carriers, partner service providers and/or agents, for example the PSTN-VoIP gateway provider, Wifi access services providers, distributors of Skype software and/or Skype products, and/or the third party banking organizations or other providers of payment, email delivery, analytical services, customer support, or hosting services. Skype will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation.</p>  
  <p>Some Skype products may be co-branded and offered together with or via a partner company. If you register for or use such products, you consent to both Skype and the partner company’s use of personal data collected in connection with the co-branded product. Skype may offer its products in connection with other websites or services or may team with other online services to give you the combined results of both products/services or additional services and benefits. To determine whether you would benefit from the combined offer, if you have provided your consent, Skype may match your email address, and email addresses of your contacts against email addresses you have provided to the third party website/service provider.</p>  
  <p>If you are a member of the Business Control Panel, detailed information about the activity on your Skype account including traffic data and details of your purchases and downloads may be accessed by the Administrator of the Business Control Panel if you have agreed to such access. You can withdraw your agreement at any time by changing the settings on your account page on www.skype.com. If you provide personal data including your name and job title to be included on the Business Control Panel directory, you acknowledge that such data may be viewed by other members of that Business Control Panel.</p>  
  <p>If you leave a voicemail for another Skype user, your voicemail message may be transferred to a third party service provider (where the Skype contact you are trying to reach has signed up to receive voicemails by text message), and will be converted to text. The conversion process may in exceptional cases, require access by analysts. By using the voicemail product, you consent to the processing of your voicemail message by Skype and its service provider.</p>  
  <p>Skype, Skype's local partner, or the operator or company facilitating your communication may provide personal data, communications content and/or traffic data to an appropriate judicial, law enforcement or government authority lawfully requesting such information. Skype will provide all reasonable assistance and information to fulfil this request and you hereby consent to such disclosure</p>  
  <p>Your information may be stored and processed in any country in which Skype and its group companies maintain facilities, including outside of the EU. In this regard, or for purposes of sharing or disclosing data in accordance with this article 4, Skype reserves the right to transfer information outside of your country. By using Skype software, Skype's websites or Skype products you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. As Skype continues to develop its business, Skype might sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions as well as in the event Skype or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal information of Skype users will generally be one of the transferred business assets. We reserve the right to include your personal information, collected as an asset, in any such transfer to a third party.</p>  
  <p> 
    <strong> 
      <a href="" id="5" name="5" shape="rect"></a>5. WHAT ARE COOKIES AND GIFS HOW DOES SKYPE USE THEM?
    </strong> 
  </p>  
  <p>Cookies are pieces of information that the browser of the Skype software client or your internet browser may store on your computer's hard drive. Cookies enable Skype to: recognize you or your preferences, gain information about the use of its websites, and help us to improve our products and websites. This information may be analyzed by third parties on our behalf.</p>  
  <p>The Help option on the toolbar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Skype software browser cookies can be disabled by: accessing the File menu from your Skype software client toolbar, choosing the Privacy option and unchecking the ‘Allow Skype Browser Cookies’ box.</p>  
  <p>Please bear in mind that some personalized services may not be available if you choose to disable cookies.</p>  
  <p>Clear Gifs</p>  
  <p>Skype web pages may include clear gifs. Clear gifs (also known as web-beacons) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, which are used to count your visits to the page (but which do not retain any personally identifiable information). In addition, Skype uses clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened and acted upon. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>  
  <p>Third Party Advertising</p>  
  <p>The adverts appearing on our websites are delivered to you by our web advertising partners. These advertising partners may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit 
    <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" shape="rect">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a>.

      <a href="" id="6" name="6" shape="rect"></a>6. YOUR USER PROFILE

It may include your Skype user name, full name, address, telephone and mobile numbers, gender, date of birth, country, language, “about me” page URL, and any other information that you decide to make available. You can access your user profile from the “Skype” menu in the Skype software client or from your account on www.skype.com in order to view, correct or complete information, remove non-mandatory information; and to see the privacy settings associated with your profile information.

    <strong> 
      <a href="" id="7" name="7" shape="rect"></a>7. LINKED WEBSITES AND THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS
    </strong> 
  </p>  
  <p>Skype websites may contain links that will let you leave Skype's website and access another website. Linked websites are not under the control of Skype and it is possible that these websites have a different privacy policy. The Privacy Policy applies solely to personal information that is acquired on the websites or through your use of the Skype software, Skype products and/or your relationship with Skype, so Skype urges you to be careful when you enter any personal information online. Skype accepts no responsibility or liability for these other websites.</p>  
  <p>If you use any extras, plug-ins or third party applications together with the Skype software (“Applications”), the provider of such Applications may obtain access to certain personal information about you. Skype does not and cannot control how the provider of Applications may use any personal information connected in connection with such Applications. Please ensure that you review any privacy policies or other terms applicable to the use of such Application before installation.</p>  
  <p> 
    <strong> 
      <a href="" id="8" name="8" shape="rect"></a>8. HOW DOES SKYPE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
    </strong> 
  </p>  
  <p>Skype shall take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect the personal data and traffic data provided to it or collected by it with due observance of the applicable obligations and exceptions under the relevant legislation. Your personal and traffic data can only be accessed by authorized employees or consultants of Skype or the concerned Skype group entities that need to have access to this data in order to be able to fulfil their given duties.</p>  
  <p> 
    <strong> 
      <a href="" id="9" name="9" shape="rect"></a>9. PERSONAL DATA OF FRIENDS
    </strong> 
  </p>  
  <p>You may be interested in inviting your friends to join Skype. In the event you wish to use Skype's referral service, you will be directed to a webpage and will have the possibility of adding one or more email addresses in an online form. The information entered in this form, will only be used for the purposes of automatically generating an email message to these potential Skype users. By entering your friend’s email address you are confirming that your friend has consented to the supply of their details. Skype may identify you as the person who has made the referral in the email sent to your friend.</p>  
  <p> 
    <strong> 
      <a href="" id="10" name="10" shape="rect"></a>10. CONTACTING YOU
    </strong> 
  </p>  
  <p>Skype may from time to time ask you to provide information on your experiences which will be used to measure and improve quality.

  </p>  
  <p>You have the right to access and, where relevant, to amend your personal information. Some of your information may be viewed or edited online by signing into your account page on www.skype.com.
