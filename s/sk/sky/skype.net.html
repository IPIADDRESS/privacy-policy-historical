<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>This privacy policy is designed to assist you in understanding how Skype uses and safeguards Information and resources you provide in using Skype Software and Services.</p>

<h6>Explanation of Service</h6>
<p>Skype Software S.A. provides the Skype Software (“Software”) and manages operations of the Skype Services (“Services”). Skype Software is provided to all users for free but some services may require registration in order to function.  Other services may require a paid subscription to Skype.</p>
<p>Through these services, you can register to become a user of the Skype Services and communicate with other Skype users through voice communication, Instant Message (IM) communication and/or other forms of communication.  You also have the option of sharing your personal profile with other users of the Skype software.  You can also search for other users and add them to your “friend’s list”. You can also approve or disapprove requests from other users who wish to add you to their friend’s list, whereby those users will be able to see your online status.  You can also invite others to download Skype software and register as a Skype user.  From time to time, new services may be added which improve, modify or extend the functionality of the Skype Services.</p>

<h6>Use of Information</h6>
<p>SKYPE DOES NOT SELL, RENT, LOAN, TRADE, LEASE OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH SKYPE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE TO ANY THIRD PARTY OUTSIDE THE SKYPE NETWORK. WE WILL TREAT ANY INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO SKYPE AS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND WILL NOT DISCLOSE IT TO ANY THIRD PARTY OUTSIDE THE SKYPE NETWORK. WE WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THE NETWORK TO OTHER USERS IN THE NETWORK ONLY WITH YOUR EXPLICIT PERMISSION AS GRANTED BY YOU THROUGH APPLICABLE SETTINGS AVAILABLE IN THE SOFTWARE.  THIS INFORMATION IS GENERALLY NOT STORED BY SKYPE AT ALL AND IS INSTEAD VOLUNTARILY SHARED BY USERS TO AND FROM OTHER USERS IN THE NETWORK.</p>

<dl>
<dt>What Information Do You Provide to us and How Do We Use it? </dt>
<dd>When you use the Skype Services and Software you provide three types of Information: (1) Personal Information you actively choose to disclose to Skype Software S.A. (“Active Information”), (2) Usage Information that is provided passively or generated automatically during your use of Skype Software (“Passive Information”) and (3) information that you share or communicate with other Skype Software users (“User Information”).</dd>
<dd><em>Active information</em> includes information which is required in order for the Software to verify your identity and provide you with the Skype Services. This includes your Skype Name and password. This information is stored centrally by Skype.  Active information may also include any billing information you submit only if you decide to purchase Services from Skype.  Billing information is stored securely by Skype’s third party billing provider according to local laws and regulations (please see privacy policy at time of purchase).  Billing information is only stored in order to comply with local regulations and to provide you with accurate billing information and service.</dd>
<dd>If you choose to invite a friend to join Skype through a menu option in the software, you will be directed to a web page and will have the possibility of adding one or more email addresses in an online form.  Any information entered in this form is stored temporarily and is used only for the purposes of automatically generating an email message to these users.  The Skype website may also contain feedback forms where feedback can be reported directly to Skype employees. Any and all information which is voluntarily submitted in such feedback forms are used for the purposes of reviewing this feedback and improving the Skype Software and Services. Skype reserves the right to utilize this information for marketing purposes, for instance by displaying selected comments on it’s website or in other communications. If Skype chooses to display a user-submitted comment it will either display it anonymously, stripping away all personally identifiable information, or request permission directly from you before displaying it.</dd>
<dd><em>User Information</em> may be required by certain Skype Services in order for the Software to function as intended and, if so desired, for other users of Skype Software to communicate with you.  User Information includes any information you enter in your User Profile (such as name and email address) and also includes your current online status and your IP number. User Information is NOT stored centrally but is temporarily transmitted to other users in the network if you have chosen to make this information available. As with most other communication software, other users of Skype Software may be able to obtain your IP address.</dd>
<dd><em>Passive Information</em> is limited to information that is necessary in order to provide you with the desired functionality of the software and may include a session ID token, source and destination addressing information, and the version of the software you are using. Passive information is automatically generated and is not stored centrally, except for anonymously aggregated statistical information used to provide you with better service or statistical information used solely for the purposes of detecting fraud or to block access to Skype Services after the free trial period has ended according to the terms set out in the End User License Agreement.</dd>
</dl>

<h6>No Content of Communications Collected</h6>
<p>Skype does not collect any Contents of Communications such as calls or Instant Messages.</p>

<h6>No Extraneous System Information Collected</h6>
<p>No information concerning your computing facilities is collected that is not related to providing Skype Services, including other installed software systems, non-service-related content, or hardware peripherals. No information about your specific computing facilities will be provided to any third party unless required by the Terms of Agreement of a Service with which you’ve registered.</p>

<h6>No Provision of Information to Third Parties Without Your Permission</h6>
<p>Skype will not sell, rent, lease or otherwise provide Active Information to any third party unless required by the terms of Agreement of a Service with which you’ve registered.</p>

<h6>What Resources Do We Use and How Do We Use Them? </h6>
<p>During the course of using Skype Software, disk space, bandwidth and processing power may be utilized to provide the Skype services to you and to communicate with other Skype users.  From time-to-time your computer may become a Supernode. A Supernode is a computer running Skype Software that has been automatically elevated to act as a hub. Supernodes may assist in helping other users to communicate or use the Skype software efficiently.  This may include the ability for your computer to help anonymously and securely facilitate communications between other users of the Skype Software who, due to network and firewall constraints, cannot establish direct connections.  The system has been designed so that being a Supernode will not interfere with the normal operations of your computer.</p>

<dl>
<dt>How Do We Protect Your Data, Information, and Resources?</dt>
<dd>Skype uses industrial strength technology to protect the data on your computer, any information you provide to us, and to protect the use of your computer resources. The data contained in your public profile is protected and can only be shared to other users if you chose to make such information public in the software settings. Passive Information you provide is stored only temporarily on secure databases and only in anonymous aggregate form unless required to provide billing information to Subscribers or to verify the integrity of your identity by Skype software or to comply with local laws or regulations. Your computer resources can not be accessed by any third party through Skype Software.</dd>

<dt>Software Installation</dt>
<dd>Skype Software is installed on computers with an installer downloaded from www.skype.com or in combination with other software or web sites. Skype Services may also be provided through other applications that utilize the Skype Software. These applications are required to display the Skype End User License Agreement before the Software is installed. You can uninstall the Skype Software from the standard Windows Control Panel at any time.</dd>

<dt>Software Updates</dt>
<dd>The Skype Software contains update functionality. This enables the Software to determine that there is a newer version available, which has improved or new functionality and/or bug fixes. You will be asked for your permission before an update is performed unless you have specifically authorized Skype to automatically update your software without notification. The Software may however update non-program files from time to time without asking the user. These updates are only used to update file indices, configurations and other non-critical objects. These updates only pertains to executable files.</dd>

<dt>Children</dt>

</dl>

<h6>Length of Time Data Will Be Stored</h6>
<p>Unless you request that we delete any of the information you submitted to Skype when you registered for any electronic updates and/or newsletters we may offer, we will store such information for a period of two years or for the period of time stipulated in applicable laws and regulations, whichever is greatest.
