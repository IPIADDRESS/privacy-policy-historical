		<p><span class="catTitle">Privacy Policy</span></p>
		<p>
				
			</p><p><span class="catCopy">SkyAuction.com has created this privacy policy 
				statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. The 
				following discloses the information gathering and dissemination 
				practice for the SkyAuction.com Web site (www.SkyAuction.com). 
				Using the Internet should be a fun experience and we want to help 
				you make it so. </span></p>
			<p><span class="catCopy">When you reserve or purchase travel services 
				through SkyAuction.com, we will ask you to provide us with personal 
				information, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, 
				credit card information and other personal identifying information. 
				We need this information in order to process your travel arrangements 
				and need to share this personal information with the relevant 
				airline, car rental agency, hotel, travel agency and/or other 
				involved third party. SkyAuction.com will send you an e-mail message 
				confirming each reservation of your online transaction. Credit 
				card information is not stored by the SkyAuction.com Web site. 
				</span></p>
			<p><span class="catCopy">As a user of SkyAuction.com, you have the 
				option to engage in certain additional activities on the site, 
				such as entering contests or sweepstakes, or receiving our e-mail 
				alerts. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. 
				If you elect to engage in these activities, however, SkyAuction.com 
				may require you to provide us with personal information, such 
				as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and other personal 
				identifying information. SkyAuction.com needs to collect this 
				personal information for various reasons, which may include: (i) 
				notifying sweepstake or contest winners, (ii) fulfilling prizes; 
				(ii) disseminating our e-mail; (iii) aggregating statistical information; 
				and (iv) tracking/verifying compliance with SkyAuction.com policies 
				and federal, state and local laws. </span></p>
			<p><span class="catCopy">SkyAuction.com recognizes and respects the 
				importance of responsible use of your personal information. If 
				you do not want the information you provide to SkyAuction.com 
				to be used to inform you of other products and special offers 
				from SkyAuction.com, and you indicate this preference when you 
				provide the information, SkyAuction.com will honor your preference. 
				In case you change your mind or some personal information may 
				change (such as your zip code), we provide a way to correct, update 
				or remove the personal data you give us. You can do this at the 
				member information page or by contacting our Customer Support 
				organization at <a href="mailto:support@SkyAuction.com">support@SkyAuction.com</a>. 
				</span> </p>
                
			<p class="catSubtitle">OPTING-OUT </p>
                
			<p><span class="catCopy">To keep you in control of your personal information 
				and the communications directed to you, we allow you to opt-out 
				of receiving communications from SkyAuction.com about new features 
				or services. If a guest objects to such use for any reason, you 
				may stop that use, either by e-mail request to <a href="mailto:support@SkyAuction.com">support@SkyAuction.com</a> 
				or by modifying your member information online. </span></p>
			<p><span class="catCopy">Information provided when reserving or purchasing 
				travel services through SkyAuction.com, may be used for marketing 
				and promotional purposes and is subject to the opt-out processes 
				described on, or linked to, each order form. </span></p>
                
			<p class="catSubtitle">THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING </p>
                
			<p class="catCopy">We use DoubleClick and other third-party advertising 
				companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies 
				may use information (not including your name, address, email address 
				or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites 
				in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites 
				about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you 
				would like more information about this practice and to know your 
				choices about not having this information used by these companies, 
				<a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/naiprivacy">click here</a></p>
                
			<p class="catSubtitle">USE OF COOKIES </p>
                
			<p class="catCopy">In the course of serving advertisements to this 
				site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique 
				"cookie" on your browser. SkyAuction.com does not have access 
				or control these cookies.</p>
                
			<p class="catSubtitle">USE OF TRAFFIC DATA </p>
                
			<p class="catCopy">Each time a visitor comes to our Web site, we collect 
				some information to improve the overall quality of the online 
				experience. At the Web site, we collect the visitor's domain name 
				(i.e. where the user is logged on, such as from yahoo.com, etc.), 
				referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user 
				visited prior to clicking through to the SkyAuction.com Web site), 
				and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh 
				platform). We collect visitor information for purposes of product 
				monitoring, product improvement, and targeted advertising. We 
				also count, track, and aggregate all visitors' activity into our 
				analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking 
				where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the SkyAuction.com 
				properties, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about 
				you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated 
				basis with our advertisers; but SkyAuction.com will not disclose 
				your individual identity or personal data without your permission. 
				When SkyAuction.com does present aggregated information to outside 
				companies, no one is able to identify you or contact you. </p>
                
			<p class="catSubtitle">USE OF IP ADDRESSES </p>
                
			<p><span class="catCopy">An IP address is a number that's automatically 
				assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web 
				servers, the big computers that "serve up" web pages, automatically 
				identify your computer by its IP address. </span></p>
			<p><span class="catCopy">SkyAuction.com collects IP addresses for 
				the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate, or 
				combined, information to our advertisers, and to audit the use 
				of our site. When users request pages from the SkyAuction.com 
				Web site, our servers log the user's IP addresses. We do not normally 
				link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means 
				that your session will be logged, but you remain anonymous to 
				us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we 
				feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or terms 
				of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others.</span> 
			</p>
                
			<p class="catSubtitle">USE OF e-mail DATA </p>
                
			<p><span class="catCopy">SkyAuction.com will use your e-mail address 
				to send correspondence about reservation confirmations, important 
				updates about your travel plans and newsletters. Members who sign 
				up to receive SkyAuction.com's newsletter and notifications of 
				travel specials, will receive a SkyAuction.com content newsletter 
				delivered either on a monthly basis, as well as occasional product-related 
				announcements. </span></p>
			<p><span class="catCopy">Users can choose to unsubscribe from SkyAuction.com 
				newsletters or product-related announcements at any time by following 
				the unsubscribe instructions found in each e-mail or by contacting 
				our Customer Support organization at <a href="mailto:support@SkyAuction.com">support@SkyAuction.com</a>. 
				</span> </p>
                
			<p class="catSubtitle">CONTESTS AND SWEEPSTAKES </p>
                
			<p class="catCopy">SkyAuction.com offers contests and sweepstakes 
				in which we request certain personal information. At a minimum, 
				the required information includes name and e-mail address; in 
				some cases, the user must answer mandatory survey questions about 
				a range of other personal data. The information gathered in the 
				entry form is used to verify the entrant's identity and to contact 
				winners and/or prize recipients. Participation in these contests 
				and sweepstakes is completely voluntary and the user therefore 
				has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. There 
				are two situations in which SkyAuction.com will divulge this information 
				to a third party provided the user gives express consent: (1) 
				A user may expressly choose to receive additional information 
				from the contest sponsor, in which case the user's personally 
				identifiable information is divulged to the advertiser. (2) Some 
				of the contests may be hosted on the SkyAuction.com site but administered 
				by the sponsor; in such cases, the information a user provides 
				is passed on to the third party as long as that user gives express 
				consent. Because the rules and terms of each contest and sweepstakes 
				can vary, all information about each contest and sweepstakes is 
				clearly posted during the event. All contests and sweepstakes 
				are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and 
				state laws. </p>
                
			<p class="catSubtitle">SURVEYS </p>
                
			<p class="catCopy">Occasionally SkyAuction.com conducts user surveys 
				to better target our content to our audience. Participation in 
				these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has 
				a choice whether or not to disclose this information. We sometimes 
				share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys 
				with our advertisers and partners. We never share any of this 
				information about specific individuals with any third party. </p>
                
			<p class="catSubtitle">LINKS TO OTHER SITES </p>
                
			<p><span class="catCopy">Users should be aware that when you are on 
				SkyAuction.com, you could be directed to other sites that are 
				beyond our control. There are links to other sites from SkyAuction.com 
				pages that take you outside our service. For example, if you "click" 
				on a banner advertisement or a SkyAuction.com more information 
				link, the "click" takes you off the SkyAuction.com site. This 
				includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may 
				use SkyAuction.com's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. 
				These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect 
				data or solicit personal information. </span></p>
			<p><span class="catCopy">SkyAuction.com's policy does not extend to 
				anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and 
				therefore beyond SkyAuction.com's control, and is not to be applied 
				in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. 
				We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and 
				to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that 
				collects personally identifiable information. </span></p>
                
			<p class="catSubtitle">SECURITY </p>
                
			<p><span class="catCopy">SkyAuction.com has taken strong measures 
				to protect the security of your personal information and to ensure 
				that your choices for its intended use are honored. We take strong 
				precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized 
				access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. </span></p>
			<p><span class="catCopy">The importance of security for all personally 
				identifiable information associated with our guests is of utmost 
				concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission 
				of your information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, 
				no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 
				100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal 
				information, SkyAuction.com can not ensure or warrant the security 
				of any information you transmit to us or from our online products 
				or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your 
				transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on 
				our systems. When credit card information is transmitted we use 
				industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. </span></p>
			<p><span class="catCopy">Your SkyAuction.com account is password protected 
				so that only you can access it and view the member information 
				relevant to the account. We recommend that you do not divulge 
				your password to anyone. SkyAuction.com will never ask you for 
				your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. Ultimately, 
				you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords 
				and any account information. </span></p>
                
			<p class="catSubtitle">YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS </p>
                
			<p class="catCopy">By using this site, you signify your assent to 
				the SkyAuction.com Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this 
				policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued use of the 
				SkyAuction.com Web site following the posting of changes to these 
				terms will mean you accept those changes. </p>
                
			<p class="catSubtitle">CONTACTING THE WEB SITE </p>
