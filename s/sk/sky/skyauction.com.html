                  our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking 
                  where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the SkyAuction.com

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SkyAuction.com 
                  offers contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain 
                  personal information. At a minimum, the required information 
                  includes name and e-mail address; in some cases, the user must 
                  answer mandatory survey questions about a range of other personal 
                  data. The information gathered in the entry form is used to 
                  verify the entrant's identity and to contact winners and/or 
                  prize recipients. Participation in these contests and sweepstakes 
                  is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice 
                  whether or not to disclose this information. There are two situations 
                  in which SkyAuction.com will divulge this information to a third 
                  party provided the user gives express consent: (1) A user may 
                  expressly choose to receive additional information from the 
                  contest sponsor, in which case the user's personally identifiable 
                  information is divulged to the advertiser. (2) Some of the contests 
                  may be hosted on the SkyAuction.com site but administered by 
                  the sponsor; in such cases, the information a user provides 
                  is passed on to the third party as long as that user gives express 
                  consent. Because the rules and terms of each contest and sweepstakes 
                  can vary, all information about each contest and sweepstakes 
                  is clearly posted during the event. All contests and sweepstakes 
                  are conducted in full accordance with United States federal 
                  and state laws. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Occasionally 
                  SkyAuction.com conducts user surveys to better target our content 
                  to our audience. Participation in these surveys is completely 
                  voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not 
                  to disclose this information. We sometimes share the aggregated 
                  demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers 
                  and partners. We never share any of this information about specific 
                  individuals with any third party. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Users 
                  should be aware that when you are on SkyAuction.com, you could 
                  be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There 
                  are links to other sites from SkyAuction.com pages that take 
                  you outside our service. For example, if you "click" on a banner 
                  advertisement or a SkyAuction.com more information link, the "click" 
                  takes you off the SkyAuction.com site. This includes links from 
                  advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use SkyAuction.com's 
                  logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may 
                  send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal 
                  information. </font></p>

                  and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable

                  importance of security for all personally identifiable information 
                  associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise 
                  great care in providing secure transmission of your information 
                  from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission 
                  over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a 
                  result, while we strive to protect your personal information, 
                  SkyAuction.com can not ensure or warrant the security of any 
                  information you transmit to us or from our online products or 
                  services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your 
                  transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security 
                  on our systems. When credit card information is transmitted 
                  we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.
