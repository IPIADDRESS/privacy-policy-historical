                            our website or by telephone. For example, our website 
                            contains a section called "Your Say", where we provide 
                            you with an opportunity to contact us with your comments 
                            (by email or by telephone). If you provide us with

                            us know if you do not want us to respond. If you would 
                            like us to respond, we will collect personal information 
                            from you (including your name, email address and suburb)

                            keep your comments but will not retain other personal

                            Please note that the personal information we hold 
                            about you will be information that you have provided

                            in its archives. You only have a legal right to seek 
                            access to personal information about you collected 
                            by us prior to 21 December 2001 if we use or disclose 
                            that personal information after that date. If you
