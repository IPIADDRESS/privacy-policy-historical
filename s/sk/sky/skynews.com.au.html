                  Sky News Australia (<b>Sky News</b>) commenced its 24 hour news 
                    service on February 19th 1996, becoming the first and only 
                    Australian produced television news channel. Sky News is a 
                    joint venture of Australia's Nine Network and Seven Network, 
                    and the United Kingdom's Sky News channel, a part of the British 
                    Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) network. <br>
                    <br>
                    Sky News respects the privacy of its audience and people we 
                    do business with, and we strive to comply with the National 
                    Privacy Principles (<b>NPPs</b>) contained in the Privacy 
                    Act 1988 (<b>the Privacy Act</b>). This Privacy Policy outlines 
                    how Sky News will handle personal information about you. As 
                    we may sometimes collect personal information online through

                    (<b>our website</b>), this Privacy Policy also outlines our 
                    approach to online privacy issues. <br>
                    <br>
                    This Privacy Policy does not apply to Sky News' journalists,

                    course of journalism. <br>
                    <br>
                    Our Privacy Policy is divided into the following sections:

                    NEWS COLLECTS PERSONAL INFORMATION.</font></b><br>
                    <br>
                    Sky News needs to collect personal information in order to 
                    conduct its business. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Our audience.</b> We collect personal information from 
                    members of the public who contact us through our website or 
                    by telephone. For example, our website contains a section 
                    called "Your Say", where we provide you with an opportunity 
                    to contact us with your comments (by email or by telephone). 
                    If you provide us with your comments, we give you the opportunity 
                    to let us know if you do not want us to respond. If you would 
                    like us to respond, we will collect personal information from 
                    you (including your name, email address and suburb) in order 
                    to do so. <br>
                    If you do wish us to respond to your enquiry, we will keep 
                    your comments but will not retain other personal information 
                    about you (ie your comments will be 'de-identified').<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Business contacts.</b> Sometimes, Sky News needs to collect 
                    personal information from people we do business with. This 
                    will usually happen when we collect the name and business 
                    contact details of a person who is the contact in a government 
                    agency or company we deal with, or in one of our contractors 
                    or suppliers or shareholders.<br>
                    <br>
                    Sky News's policy is only to use personal information collected 
                    from its audience or business contacts for the business purpose 
                    for which it was collected, and not for any other purpose.<br>
                    <br>
                    We do not collect personal information that we do not need. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Sky News will not sell, rent or trade personal information 
                    about you to or with others. <br>
                    <br>
                    Personal information collected by Sky News may be disclosed 
                    to third parties to whom we outsource specialised functions 
                    (such as mailing houses or printing companies), and if so, 
                    Sky News takes steps to ensure that those contractors:<br>

                      would otherwise be exempt from the NPPs); and</li>

                  </ul>
                  The only other time Sky News would make disclosures of personal 
                  information is if we are required to do so by law, or if the 
                  disclosure is permitted under the Privacy Act.<br>

                  Sky News takes physical, electronic and managerial steps to 
                  ensure that the personal information it holds is secure from 
                  unauthorised access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. 
                  Sky News only permits your details to be accessed by authorised 
                  personnel, and we educate our staff about their responsibilities 
                  under the NPPs. <br>

                  Under the Privacy Act, you have the right to seek access to 
                  information which Sky News holds about you (although there are 
                  some exceptions to this). You also have the right to ask us 
                  to correct information about you which is inaccurate, incomplete 
                  or out of date. <br>
                  <br>
                  If you wish to exercise your right under the Privacy Act to 
                  seek access to the personal information that Sky News holds 
                  about you, or if you believe that personal information about 
                  you is not accurate, complete or up to date, you should contact 
                  Sky News's Privacy Officer, including the details of your request 
                  for correction (if applicable). The contact details for Sky 
                  News's Privacy Officer can be found at the end of this Privacy 
                  Policy. <br>
                  <br>
                  Please note that the personal information we hold about you 
                  will be information that you have provided to us. <br>
                  <br>
                  We will assume (unless you tell us otherwise) that your request 
                  relates to our current records about you. To provide you with 
                  access to "current" personal information, Sky News would ordinarily 
                  provide you with a print-out of the relevant personal information 
                  from our databases, or with photocopies of records which are 
                  held only on paper files. Ordinarily, Sky News will not charge 
                  you for the cost of providing this type of access to these records. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  For legal and administrative reasons, Sky News may also store 
                  records containing personal information in its archives. You 
                  only have a legal right to seek access to personal information 
                  about you collected by us prior to 21 December 2001 if we use 
                  or disclose that personal information after that date. If you 
                  do wish to seek access to personal information collected by 
                  us prior to 21 December 2001, please contact our Privacy Officer 
                  to discuss whether access may be available. Please note that 
                  if we do provide access to old records, we may charge you for 
                  the cost of providing such access <br>
