			<p class="l2_content"><b>Users Outside Of The United States.</b><br>Your personal information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>
			
			
			<h2>INFORMATION COLLECTED AND HOW WE USE IT</h2>	
			<p class="l2_content">One of our primary goals in collecting personal information from you is to give you a meaningful, enjoyable and customized experience while using our websites, products and services and to allow us to develop new products and services that are relevant to visitors like you.  Personal information also allows us to provide specific services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize the webpage or service to make your online experience smooth and efficient.</p>
			
			
			<h2>What We Collect</h2>		
			<p class="l2_content"><b>Personal Information</b><br>We collect the following types of information from you when you register for an account on our website: name, shipping address, phone number, fax number, email address, date of birth, and demographics.  For the use or purchase of certain products or services, we also collect professional designation, specialty, state license number, medical school and year of graduation and (during a purchase) credit card information and billing address.  If you voluntarily provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.  When you voluntarily participate in one of our surveys or programs (as described in further detail below), we may collect additional user information.</p>
			
			
				
			<p class="l2_content"><b>Non-Personal Information</b><br>In addition to gathering information through the registration of users, may also monitor the use of our website, services and/or products by collecting aggregate, anonymous, non-personal information.  Typically, this information tracks users patterns throughout the PIH's websites, and it may include information such as your browser type, operating system, date/time stamp for your visit, IP address, domain name, referring URLs, statistics about the number of visitors to the site, the number of pages visited, and user response rates.  This information enables us to provide a more enjoyable and personalized experience, as well as tracking errors.</p>
			
							
			<p class="l2_content"><b>Cookies</b><br>Additionally, when you use our products, services or websites, we may monitor your use of the website by collecting aggregate information through the use of "cookies."   Cookies are small pieces of information that a website transfers to the memory or hard drive on your computer.  For instance, when you visit one of our websites, our web server will automatically recognize some non-personal information, including but not limited to the date and time you visited our site, the pages you visited, the referrer (the website you came from), the type of browser you are using (e.g. Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), and the domain name and address of your Internet service provider (e.g., AT&amp;T, Verizon, AOL).</p>
			<p class="l2_content">Most web browsers have options that allow you to control whether or not to accept cookies.  However, disabling cookies in your browser may prevent access to some parts of PIH's website, services, or products.</p>
			
			
			
			
			<p class="l2_content"><b>Market Research Information</b><br>Users of PIH's websites, products and/or services may also elect to participate in market research surveys or programs.  By submitting answers to these surveys or programs, you are providing specific feedback to us and/or certain third parties (as described below).  Participation in a survey or program is voluntary and you have the opportunity to decline participation or honoraria.  If you elect to participate in a survey or program, we may disclose your information to certain third parties (as described below), provided you have given us a consent to do so.</p>
			
			
			<p class="l2_content"><b>Information Collected from Other Sources</b><br>We may occasionally supplement your information with information we receive from other sources including, but not limited to (a) companies that provide our products or services by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website, (b) companies (e.g., pharmaceutical companies) that sponsor surveys or programs on our website (the entities in (a) and (b), collectively, "Partner Companies"), (c) downloadable software applications from our websites or (d) professional organizations such as the American Medical Associations, which we will add to the information which we already hold about you.</p>
			
			
			<h2>How Information is Used</h2>
			<p class="l2_content">We use the information we collect to administer our business activities, improve our website, products and services, provide customer service, make available products and services to our users and customers, and for the recruiting, marketing, and other business purposes of PIH and our Partner Companies.</p>
			
			<p class="l2_content">Without limiting the foregoing, this information helps us to create your account, verify your identity, verify your eligibility for products and services, deliver interactive educational programs, provide you support, initiate and fulfill orders, complete transactions, and administer the website.</p>
			
			<p class="l2_content">Without limiting the foregoing, we may use your personal information to communicate with you.  For example, we may correspond with you, possibly through email, direct mail, fax, or phone calls related to your transactions and orders, participation in our surveys, programs and services, invitations to new surveys or programs and services, deliver information about new surveys, programs or services, and to alert you to developments in the use of pharmaceuticals or selected information from the pharmaceutical industry related to your medical specialty.  We use contact and demographic information to offer participation in surveys or programs.  We may need to respond to your comments or requests for information; or we may contact you if needed in the course of processing or shipping products or services offered through our websites.  We may also use contact and demographic information to extend offers to you from our Partner Companies.</p>
			
			
			<h2>Disclosing Personal Information</h2>
			<p class="l2_content">In order to provide you with our website, services, and/or products, we may share your information with our suppliers, agents, contractors, or other service providers ("Service Providers") in connection with the services they perform.  Our Service Providers are required not to sell, share, or use your personal information other than to provide the services requested by Company.</p>
			
			<p class="l2_content">We may disclose your personal information to our Partner Companies, who may use this information to provide services requested by PIH and/or for their recruiting, marketing or other business purposes.  For example, without limitation, (1) if you have elected to participate in a survey or program, we may share your personal information with the sponsors of the survey or program, when we report the results of the survey or program to the sponsors; and (2) if you accessed our website, product, or service through a co-branded website, we may share your personal information with the co-branded website provider.  We do not control the privacy practices of our Partner Companies.</p>
			
			<p class="l2_content">There are specific limited instances when personal information may be shared with accredited Continuing Medical Education ("CME") providers for their fulfillment of their reporting obligations under the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education ("ACCME") and other accrediting bodies.  We do not control the privacy practices of these third parties.</p>
			
			<p class="l2_content">We may create aggregate non-personally identifiable information from personal information about our users, sales, products or traffic patterns ("anonymous information"); this anonymous information does not include any personally identifiable information. We use this anonymous information to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our website, products, surveys and/or services.  PIH reserves the right to use and disclose anonymous information to third parties in its discretion.</p>
			
			<p class="l2_content"><b>Disclosure by Law</b><br>PIH may use or disclose personal information if it believes in good faith that such use or disclosure is necessary to (a) help identify any person attempting to break into or damage our website, (b)  to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding any illegal activities, (c) to comply with relevant laws, or legal or regulatory obligations, (d) to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on PIH, or (e) to protect or defend the rights or property of PIH or its customers.  Without limiting the foregoing, we may share personal information with law enforcement agencies if we believe that we have evidence of a violation of computer security or related laws.</p>
			
			
			<h2>PROTECTION OF YOUR DATA</h2>
			<p class="l2_content">PIH has a number of security measures in place to help protect and safeguard your personal information from accidental loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or accidental destruction.</p>
			
			<p class="l2_content">Although no web site can guarantee the absolute security of your information, we are committed to taking  commercially reasonable precautions as described below.</p>
			
			<p class="l2_content">These procedures include the use of firewalls, secure connections on PIH websites, and frequently the use of Secured Socket Layers (SSLs) that encrypt pages that collect sensitive information.  Personal information is stored in limited access servers and physical access to our servers requires individual authorization and authentication.  Only authorized PIH employees or contractors carrying out permitted functions are allowed access to personal information.  In addition, each employee and contractor of PIH is required to sign a confidentiality agreement requiring him or her to keep confidential all personal information of users and customers.  We train our employees and contractors on proper use and handling of personal information.  Employees and contractors who violate these policies may be subject to disciplinary action, termination of their employment and legal action.  Our Service Providers are also required to maintain security measures similar to PIH.  However, for added protection, we ask that you keep your login information and passwords confidential.</p>
			
			<h2>UPDATING YOUR DATA</h2>
			<p class="l2_content">It is important to us that you are able to take an active role in your experience with us.  We highly recommend that you confirm and update your profile regularly.  You can update or change your profile, which includes personal information, online at any time. You may request deletion of your personal information by us, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).
