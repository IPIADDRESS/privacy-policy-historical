<p class="subtitle">Skyscape Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Skyscape recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of information we may collect from our on-line visitors. To this end, we are committed to using our best efforts to respect the privacy of our on-line visitors.</p> 
<p class="subtitle">Information we collect</p>
<p>At various times, Skyscape requests personal information. This can be done while you are visiting the site, or during a purchase via our Web site, phone, or fax. Information we collect is voluntarily provided by a website visitor and may include your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information (during a purchase), and personal interests. In addition, Skyscape periodically sponsors contests and other promotions that may require additional information in order to participate.</p>
<p class="subtitle">What we do with this information</p>
<p>The requests for information allows Skyscape to provide services you have requested or to enhance your experience while visiting us. The information that we collect during a purchase is necessary for us to process your order, track the status of your order, and provide the best customer service possible.</p>
<p>Skyscape will not sell your private information to any outside company for its use in marketing or solicitation. </p>
<p>Skyscape  may use customer information on an aggregate basis to better understand our users and to improve our services. Aggregate statistics may also be disclosed to potential advertisers and/or business partners. (For example, we might use the aggregate statistic "10% of Skyscape's users are from Massachusetts", but we would not give away that "Mr. John Doe, age 42, is from Boston, MA).</p>
<p>Skyscape  may share any information with third parties or regulatory agencies to comply with any laws, or if  we are compelled to do so by force of law. In the unlikely event that Skyscape (or substantially all of its assets) is acquired, personally identifiable and aggregate information may be transferred as part of such assets.</p>
<p>Periodically, we will use the information provided to us to notify you of important announcements regarding special offers or important functionality changes to our Web site. Skyscape also provides free email newsletters to those who are interested in receiving them. If you would rather not receive these updates and/or newsletters, you can request to be excluded from these announcements in your user profile at Skyscape or by replying to the email you receive. We include unsubscribe instructions with each email newsletter we send out.</p>
<p class="subtitle">The use of ‘cookies’</p>
<p>Skyscape.com website does use cookies. Cookies are small information files stored by your browser on your hard drive that allow us to provide advanced features such as personalization and shopping carts. The cookies we use do not contain any personal information. If you wish, you can change your browser settings to disable cookies, but please note that cookies must be enabled on your browser in order to make a purchase at our Web site.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Links to other sites</p> 
<p>As a resource to our visitors, Skyscape provides links to other websites. We try to carefully choose web sites which we believe are useful and meet our high standards. However, because websites change quickly, we cannot guarantee the standards of every website link we provide or be responsible for the content of other sites.</p> 
<p class="subtitle">Children</p>
<p>We do not specifically collect information about children.</p> 
<p class="subtitle">Your consent</p>
<p>By visiting and purchasing products through Skyscape’s Web site, you consent to the collection and use of the information described above by Skyscape.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Change Policy</p>
<p>We may periodically modify this privacy policy and will provide a notification of a change via a posting on the site or email or the software license. Your continued use of the Software, Site, or Services following the posting of changes to this privacy policy will indicate that you have accepted those changes. </p>
