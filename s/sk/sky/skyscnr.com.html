For example, if you have searched for a flight from Edinburgh to London on Skyscanner or another non-Skyscanner Platform, and we have asked Third Party Ad Solution to show our advert to individuals that have expressed an interest in travelling to London, the Third Party Ad Solution may categorise you within that group and serve you our advert."},{"title":"How can I control the adverts I see?","description":"You can find information about how to tailor your advertising preferences in our \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.skyscanner.com\u002Fmedia\u002Fcookie-policy\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ECookie Policy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E."}]},"cookies":{"title":"Do we use cookies or similar technologies?","description":"We use cookies and similar technologies to help deliver, optimise, personalise and analyse our services and for advertising purposes.","more":"Learn more about cookies and similar technologies","subsections":[{"description":"We use a combination of cookies and other technologies such as pixels\u002Fweb beacons and tracking codes (explained below) to collect information for use in line with the purposes set out in this policy.","id":"cookies"},{"title":"What is a cookie?","description":["A cookie is a small data file that is stored on your computer or device.

Firstly, adverts that are personalised for you based on information collected by us or by Third Party Ad Solutions whilst you use our services, such as your general location (by city or country) and your Skyscanner searches or booking history (<dfn>"Skyscanner-related Information"</dfn>). So, for example, if you've booked a flight to Rome, you'll see adverts about hotels in Rome, rather than hotels in Paris (Paris is lovely, but this could be a bit annoying!). Skyscanner-related Information will never include your name, contact details or other information that would enable you to be identified in the offline world. Secondly, adverts that are personalised for you based on information that we have no visibility or control over, and which is instead collected from you by Third Party Solutions when you have been using other non-Skyscanner websites or platforms (<dfn>"non-Skyscanner Platforms"</dfn>). Collectively, we refer to these as "interest-based" advertisements.</p><p class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--base__1hTVF Content_Content__description__1_uIJ">The information required to deliver these interest-based advertisements will be stored by Third Party Ad Solutions alongside your IP address and/or a cookie ID, so that you can be served the adverts without the Third Party Ad Solutions needing to store any information that would enable you to be identified in the offline world, like your name or address.</p><p class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--base__1hTVF Content_Content__description__1_uIJ">When you are opted-in to ads personalisation we may also use information we collect via cookies and similar technologies to show you personalised ads, marketing and promotions on Skyscanner, or to send you communications where you have opted in to receive these. For example, where you book a flight using Skyscanner or redirect from Skyscanner to make a booking on one of our partner sites, we may use the information we collect via cookies and similar technologies to personalise the ads we show you or to send you personalised marketing communications relevant to your booking based on information like your destination, the time you are travelling, the services you've selected or which travel supplier you are travelling with. We may also use this information to provide you with relevant information about the destination you are travelling to such as City Guides or up to date weather information or to request reviews and recommendations about the places you have visited.</p></div><div class="Content_Content__2CUaO"><h3 class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--base__1hTVF Content_Content__title__1B6Yq">Adverts you might see whilst on non-Skyscanner platforms</h3><p class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--base__1hTVF Content_Content__description__1_uIJ">You might also see adverts for our services once you've left Skyscanner and are using non-Skyscanner websites. For example, this would happen where a non-Skyscanner Platform that you use makes advertising space available for sale and Skyscanner, or a Third Party Ad Solution that we work with, purchases that space. Similar to the adverts you see whilst using Skyscanner, these adverts may be personalised and served to you because of information that Third Party Ad Solutions have collected about you, either when you were using our services or when you were using other non-Skyscanner Platforms. For example, if you have searched for a flight from Edinburgh to London on Skyscanner or another non-Skyscanner Platform, and we have asked Third Party Ad Solution to show our advert to individuals that have expressed an interest in travelling to London, the Third Party Ad Solution may categorise you within that group and serve you our advert.</p></div><div class="Content_Content__2CUaO"><h3 class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--base__1hTVF Content_Content__title__1B6Yq">How can I control the adverts I see?</h3><p class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--base__1hTVF Content_Content__description__1_uIJ">You can find information about how to tailor your advertising preferences in our <a href="https://www.skyscanner.com/media/cookie-policy" target="_blank">Cookie Policy</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></dd></div></dl></div></div></div><div class="Grid_Grid__container__30HCd Grid_Grid__container--padding-0__3ISFJ Grid_Grid__container--padding-mobile-1__3MLCh Grid_Grid__container--padding-tablet-1__2fx5m Summary_Summary__container__1KNxh"><div class="Grid_Grid__row__1ugns"><h2 class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--xl__33Yj3 Summary_Summary__title__2PVJj">Do we use cookies or similar technologies?</h2></div><div class="Grid_Grid__row__1ugns Summary_Summary__contentContainer__1EvIX"><div class="Grid_Grid__column__1dcDh Grid_Grid__column--4__2hRp1 Summary_Summary__imageContainer__Ck60B"><img class="Summary_Summary__image__2j2l1" src="https://content.skyscnr.com/m/73ab4beb7a5aa9c2/webimage-Privacy+Policy_CookiesSimilarTech.svg" alt=""></div><div class="Grid_Grid__column__1dcDh Grid_Grid__column--20__1oUj9 Grid_Grid__column--mobile-24__GynZ4 Grid_Grid__column--tablet-24__2HlWd Summary_Summary__descriptionContainer__3mK6Q"><p class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--base__1hTVF Summary_Summary__description__29Zdb">We use cookies and similar technologies to help deliver, optimise, personalise and analyse our services and for advertising purposes.</p><dl class="BpkAccordion_bpk-accordion__26aDu Summary_Summary__accordion__3vJip"><div><dt aria-level="3" class="BpkAccordionItem_bpk-accordion__title__9L_DL"><button type="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="undefined_content" class="BpkAccordionItem_bpk-accordion__toggle-button__3Gnu6"><span class="BpkAccordionItem_bpk-accordion__flex-container__3dYjm"><span class="BpkText_bpk-text__3rOAy  BpkAccordionItem_bpk-accordion__title-text__2YN3z">Learn more about cookies and similar technologies</span><span class="BpkAccordionItem_bpk-accordion__icon-wrapper__2RrTZ"><span style="line-height:1.125rem;display:inline-block;margin-top:0.1875rem;vertical-align:top"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="18" height="18" style="width:1.125rem;height:1.125rem" class="BpkAccordionItem_bpk-accordion__item-expand-icon___w6_L"><path d="M12 17.5l-7.2-6.4c-.6-.5-.7-1.5-.1-2.1.5-.6 1.5-.7 2.1-.1l5.2 4.6 5.2-4.6c.6-.6 1.6-.5 2.1.1s.5 1.6-.1 2.1L12 17.5z"></path></svg></span></span></span></button></dt><dd id="undefined_content" aria-labelledby="undefined_content" class="BpkAccordionItem_bpk-accordion__content-container__10ba5"><div style="height:0;overflow:hidden;-webkit-transition:height 200ms ease;-moz-transition:height 200ms ease;-o-transition:height 200ms ease;-ms-transition:height 200ms ease;transition:height 200ms ease"><div><div class="Grid_Grid__row__1ugns"><div class="Content_Content__2CUaO" id="cookies"><p class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--base__1hTVF Content_Content__description__1_uIJ">We use a combination of cookies and other technologies such as pixels/web beacons and tracking codes (explained below) to collect information for use in line with the purposes set out in this policy.</p></div><div class="Content_Content__2CUaO"><h3 class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--base__1hTVF Content_Content__title__1B6Yq">What is a cookie?</h3><p class="BpkText_bpk-text__5Kg4p BpkText_bpk-text--base__1hTVF Content_Content__description__1_uIJ">A cookie is a small data file that is stored on your computer or device.
