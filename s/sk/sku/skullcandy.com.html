This privacy policy tells you what information we collect and how we may use it as well as the steps we take to ensure that it is protected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>What kind of information do we collect?</b><br> There are cases where Skullcandy may ask you for personal information, such as your name, address, date of birth, gender, email address, etc. We do this for instance when you register for contests/promotions, respond to communication such as e-mail, and for services that require registration or subscription. If you would like to be on our mailing list, we will ask you to actively opt-in. We might also collect personal information from you about a third party, for instance if the website allows you to send an email referring someone to our site or an active promotion, in which case we need to know the name and e-mail address of the recipient. That information will only be used for the specific purpose (delivering the email) and Skullcandy will not further contact the third party unless the third party contacts us.<br>  - We may use 'cookies' to gather information about your visits to our website and enhance your experience. You can find more information on how we use cookies in the section 'Use of Cookies'.<br>  - When you visit our website we may collect so called 'click stream' data (server address, domain name etc). This information can be combined with information you have provided to us (for instance by registering), which will enable us to analyze and better customize your visits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>Use of visitors' information</b><br> All personal information that we obtain about you will be recorded, used and protected by us in accordance with current data protection legislation and this privacy policy. We will primarily use your personal information to provide products and services to you and, for example:<br> - To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature and to provide you with the relevant products or services (for instance to deliver a prize you may have won in a contest). You may be contacted by phone or email.<br> - To send you information/materials via e-mail or sms-messages about products, offers and news we think could interest you. This information may relate to products, offers and news of Skullcandy and/or its licensees or carefully selected commercial partners. We only send you this if you have opted-in to receive Skullcandy e-mails and/or sms messages. In case you do not want to receive any e-mails and/or sms messages from us anymore, or if you want to modify you personal data or want your personal data to be deleted from our database, we refer you to the 'Opt-out, delete or modify personal information' section below<br> - To analyze visits to the website and learn about the interests of our visitors in aggregate and also on personal level to better understand your interest and need, so we can improve our products and services and deliver to you the type of content, features and promotions that you are most interested in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>Who manages visitors' information</b><br> The global and local websites of Skullcandy and the information collected, are managed and controlled by Skullcandy.

Your data may be transferred to web site hosting partners and other parties who assist us in designing and operating the website, executing services (for instance prize fulfillment) or help us analyze collected data. These parties will only use your data for the purpose of carrying out the work as indicated and will be required to keep the information confidential. We will also release personal data without consent if such is required by law, for security purposes, or to prevent imminent harm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>Links to third parties</b><br> For your convenience and to improve the usage of the website we insert links to third parties, for which this privacy policy does not apply. These links take you outside our service and off the Skullcandy site and are beyond our control.
