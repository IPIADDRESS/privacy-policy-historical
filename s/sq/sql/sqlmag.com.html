			<span class="head18">Privacy Statement</span><br><br>

			Penton Media, Inc. (Penton), doing business as the Windows &amp; .NET Magazine Network, is committed to your privacy. The following paragraphs fully describe the Windows &amp; .NET Magazine Network's practices regarding information you provide when using one of our products or services.<br><br>

			<b>Information Collection</b><br>
			We may ask you to provide information about yourself when you use our various site services, subscribe to a publication or register for an event. We collect personal identifying information such as your name, email address, postal address and phone number along with basic demographic information about your job and place of business. The ways we use the information are outlined below: 
			<br><br>
			
			<b>Site Services</b><br>
			For our "Email a Friend" service, personal information is not stored or collected in any fashion. <br><br>
			
			For our "Post a Comment" service, your name and email address, if provided, are posted along with your comment on our sites, but not used for any other purpose. <br><br>
			
			For our "Site Feedback" service, personal information is only passed to customer service representatives within Penton so that we may personally follow up on your feedback if necessary. This information is not stored or used for any other purpose.<br><br>
			
			<b>Web Site Registration and Email Newsletters</b><br>
			You must register in order to view selected site content, manage your email newsletter subscriptions, or participate in our discussion forums. We may share aggregated, non-identifying information with third parties for marketing purposes. At the time you register, you may decline to receive email notification of new products and services from Penton, its affiliates, and third parties that we believe may be of interest to you. All mailings for third-party products and services are made by Windows &amp; .NET Magazine through our contracted email delivery service. Your email address and other personally identifiable information will not be shared with the vendors offering the new products or services.<br><br>
			

			
			<b>Print and CD Subscriptions</b><br>
			When you order any of our print publications or CD products, your postal address information is used primarily to fulfill your subscription request and to communicate with you about your subscription. We will also use the information to promote Windows &amp; .NET Magazine and Penton Media products and services. Your postal address information may be rented to select third parties for selected promotions. Offers are carefully screened to ensure our customers only receive targeted messages from reputable firms. Names and addresses are released only to bonded mail-houses for use on behalf of the client. Your personal information is never released directly to the third-party vendors.<br><br>

			<b>Cookies and our Third-party Vendors</b><br>
			Our sites use "cookies" to set and maintain site preferences during your session, to authenticate when you log in as a subscriber, and to help facilitate your experience on our sites. Other cookies from third-party vendors may be used to facilitate serving ads and analyzing overall Web site usage (see below). <br><br>
			
			
			We use DoubleClick DART, a third-party ad serving system, to serve ads on the site. We use only non-personally identifiable information about your visit to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. We also use HitBox Enterprise by WebSideStory to get an aggregate picture of traffic patterns on our site. Aggregate information, not individual data, collected from DART and HitBox is used to create an overall picture of how people use our site in order to improve site experience, to help our advertisers better understand our services, and to monitor advertising efforts on the site. Both DART and HitBox may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your computer that does not contain any personally identifiable information. <br><br>
			
			If you would like more information about the privacy policies of our third-party vendors, please visit the WebSideStory privacy center or the DoubleClick privacy center. <br><br>
			
			<b>Security</b><br>
			We use reasonable precautions to keep the personal information that you disclose to us secure and to disclose such information only within the above guidelines. Where information is shared, it is only with your permission and only to third parties we believe to be responsible. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that receive the information. Our sites also link to many other sites and we are not responsible for their privacy policies or practices.<br><br>
