    <p>
    </p><ul>
        <li>We collect personal information you provide to us when you request products, services or information from us, register with us, participate in public forums or other activities on our Site and Applications, respond to consumer surveys, or otherwise interact with us.  Please keep in mind that when you provide information to us on a third-party site or platform, the information you provide may be separately collected by the third-party site or platform.  The information we collect is covered by this Privacy Policy, and the information that the third-party site or platform collects is subject to that third party's privacy policy.  Privacy choices you have made on the third-party site or platform will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly through our Applications. </li>
        <li>We collect information through technology, such as cookies, Flash cookies and Web beacons, including when you visit our Site and Applications or use our Applications on third-party sites or platforms.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can generally change your browser's settings to display a warning before accepting a cookie, or to block all cookies. Visit&nbsp;www.aboutcookies.org&nbsp;to learn about how to delete and control cookies using the main browser types.</li>
        <li>To make our Site more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.</li>
        <li>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider ("ISP"), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our services to our users' needs.  Except to the extent, if any, noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically collected data to your personal information.</li>
        <li>We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Site and Applications.  Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Site (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number).  They do this by using cookies, web beacons or other technologies.  Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Site and the other sites tracked by these third parties. This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or web beacons in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technologies.  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies click here: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a> or <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>. </li>
        <li>We do not currently respond to "do not track" signals or other mechanisms that might enable consumers to opt out of tracking on our Site and Applications.</li>
        <li>We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you have downloaded our Applications.  This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include your geographic location, how you use the Applications, and information about the type of device you use.  In addition, in the event our Applications crash on your mobile device, we may receive information about your mobile device model, software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Applications.  This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.</li>
        <li>We use third party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Site and the Applications.  These tools collect information sent by your mobile device or our Site, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving our Site and our Applications.  We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other users so that it cannot be reasonably used to identify any particular individual user.</li>
