   <br><br>SquareTrade is committed to maintaining the privacy of all individuals and companies that access SquareTrade's web site, for purchasers of the SquareTrade CarePlan; who become Members of SquareTrade Seal Program,  Care Plus Feature; and who participate in our Dispute Resolution process. As part of the normal operation of our site we collect and, in some cases, disclose information about you. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you and what may happen to that information. 	
   <br><br>SquareTrade is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program, which is a non-profit organization dedicated to building trust in the Internet by having member organizations such as SquareTrade disclose information practices. TRUSTe operates as a third-party "watch dog" by auditing our privacy practices to make sure that we are in compliance with TRUSTe's privacy standards. This document discloses the privacy practices for <a href="/pages/">www.squaretrade.com</a>. When you visit a Web site displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, you can expect to be notified of:

   <li>With whom the information may be shared;</li>
   <li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information;</li>
   <li>What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under SquareTrade's control; and</li>
   <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>

For individuals-first and last name, email address, daytime telephone number, as well as product purchase and serial number information.  For Sellers-first and last name, email address, marketplace User ID, address and telephone number.  
   <br><br>
		<i>Public Seal Information</i> (Some or all of this information will be displayed on your Seal, and may also be disclosed to buyers who have been involved in a transaction with you.) For individuals - first name, last name, email address, marketplace user ID, address, daytime telephone number, applicable license number.   For companies - company name, address, years in business, email address, applicable license number, marketplace user ID, Key Customer Service Contact's name, address and telephone number. You will also be able to select whether or not some information, such as your address and daytime telephone number are displayed on the Seal.
   <br><br>
   <i>Private Member Information</i> (information which we may collect for Seal Application processing) For individuals - telephone number, sales revenue, fax number, web address, credit card number and payment details, date of birth, social security number; For companies - sales revenue, fax number, DUNS number, business references.
   <br><br>
   <i><b>Public eBay Information</b></i> For eBay Seal Members (pending, currently active, suspended or cancelled) we collect public eBay information including sales, feedback and listing information. We may manipulate this publicly available information to produce meaningful statistics with eBay sales metrics. We may also collect similar information for users of our Dispute Resolution Services. 

	 <br><br>
   <i>User Registration Information</i> (may be collected for people using Dispute Resolution Services who are not applying for a Seal) Full name, marketplace user ID, email address, phone number. Your registration information can be updated by clicking on Update Profile on the Sign In page.
   <br><br>
   <i>Case Information</i> (specifics about the problem being filed and responded to) Includes the transaction information submitted on the filing form, both parties' email addresses and marketplace identifications, and the type of dispute identified in the filing form.
   <br><br>
   In the course of your participating in a Dispute Resolution process we collect:
   <br><br>
   <i>Settlement Discussion Information</i> (information you submit in the course of discussing settlement or resolution of your case) All potential settlements or resolutions proposed during filing and responding, correspondence submitted on our secure Web Site or to us during Direct Negotiation and mediation process, all communications from the mediator and from the other party, and any recommended resolutions not accepted.
   <br><br>
   If you send us <i>personal correspondence,</i> such as emails or letters, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.
   <br><br>
   At the conclusion of the Dispute Resolution process we may record the following <i>Resolution Behavior Information</i> about you and associate it with your User Registration Information and your Member Number,(<i>if you are a Seal Member</i>):
   <ul>
   <i>If you file a case, whether you:</i><br>
   - participated in the Dispute Resolution process to completion<br>
   - were able to reach an agreement with the other party<br>
   - chose to accept a resolution recommended by the SquareTrade Mediator
   <br><br>
   <i>If someone else files a case pertaining to you, if you:</i><br>
   - submit a response<br>
   - have multiple cases of the same problem type<br>
   - participated in the resolution process to completion<br>
   - were able to reach an agreement with the other party<br>
   - chose to accept a resolution recommended by the SquareTrade Mediator
   </ul>
   <i>Resolution Information</i><br>
   If you resolve a case, the Resolution or the Settlement Agreement, and the time and date stamp of your signature.
   <br><br>
   All case records are confidential.  All of the information we gather is stored in a secure database.
   <br><br>
   <b>Tracking</b><br>
   There are two ways to maintain user experience throughout a "transaction" on SquareTrade's site.  One is by identifying a user by their IP address, and the other is by setting a cookie. Since some users use proxy services to access the Internet (and do not have a fixed IP address), SquareTrade uses cookies for all users.
   <br><br>
   To enhance the dispute resolution experience and training of mediators, SquareTrade tracks information, including details of the case, the transaction, the problem, communications that a user had with the other party and with the SquareTrade Mediator.
   <br><br>
   In order to help us improve the site user experience you agree that we may use personally identifiable information about you to, analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our site's content, layout and services.  We also track how users navigate the site by assigning cookies to site visitors. This data is NOT connected with user registration and hence, is NOT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE. This means that while we know how many people have visited a particular page on the site, we do not know WHO these people are.
   <br><br>
   If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use SquareTrade's services that require you to "sign in" or "register".  However, you can still use SquareTrade to obtain general information.
   <br><br>
   SquareTrade cookies are inactive once a user leaves our site. If you are still uncomfortable with the SquareTrade cookies, you can always delete and/or disable your cookies after your SquareTrade session is over.
