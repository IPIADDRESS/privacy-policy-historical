<ul>
<li>you have provided your consent to us using the data in that way, or</li>
<li>our use of your personal data is necessary to support 'legitimate interests' that we
have as a business
(for example, to improve our products, or to carry out analytics across our
datasets), in a way that is
proportionate and respects your privacy.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="privacy-section-4">4. Who do we share your personal data with?</h2>
<p>We work with many third parties, to help manage our business and deliver services. These
third parties may
from time to time need to have access to your personal data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our mailing application provider Aweber Systems, Inc., based in the USA, who is
Privacy Shield certified

 and processes personal data on our behalf;
</li>
<li>Our plugin provider and host of Wordpress.com Automattic, Inc., based in the USA who
is Privacy Shield
certified as you may <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000CbqcAAC&amp;status=Active">
<strong>see here</strong></a> and processes personal data on our behalf;
</li>
<li>Our analytics service providers (such as Google, Hotjar and VWO), who process
personal data for their
own purposes as Data Controllers. Please refer to our Cookie Policy in the Appendix

<li>Service providers or data processors that handle your personal data on our
instructions, for example

interests or security.
</li>
<li>In the event we sell, buy or re-organise any business or assets, or if our assets
are acquired by a third
party, including prospective sellers or buyers.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="privacy-section-5">5. International Transfers</h2>
<p>International Transfers mean that personal data is transferred to a country outside the
European Union.</p>
<p>As set out in <a href="http://www.squawka.com/privacy-policy#privacy-section-4"><strong>Section 4</strong></a> above, we
may allow access to
your personal data to third parties who may be located outside the European Union.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your personal data if we receive a legal or regulatory request from
a foreign law enforcement
body outside the European Union.</p>
<p>We will always take steps to ensure that any international transfer of information is
managed to protect your
rights and interests. Any requests for information that we receive from law enforcement
or regulators will be
carefully checked before personal data is disclosed.</p>
<p>You have the right to ask us for more information about the safeguards we have put in
place as mentioned above.
Contact us (<a href="http://www.squawka.com/privacy-policy#privacy-section-8"><strong>see Section 8</strong></a>) if you
wish
further information.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-section-6">6. Direct Marketing</h2>
<p>We will use your personal data to send you direct marketing communications regarding
products and services that
we and our partners offer regarding for example online casino, sports betting and
financial services. This may
be in the form of email or targeted online advertisements.</p>
<p>In some cases our processing of your personal data for marketing purposes will be based
on our legitimate
interests (<a href="http://www.squawka.com/privacy-policy#privacy-section-3"><strong>see Section 3 above</strong></a>).
When required by
law it will be based on your consent.</p>
<p>You always have a right to say no to further direct marketing, at any time. You can use
the opt-out link that
you find in all direct marketing communications, or by contacting us
(<a href="http://www.squawka.com/privacy-policy#privacy-section-8"><strong>see Section 8</strong></a>).</p>
<p>We take steps to limit direct marketing to a reasonable and proportionate level, and to
send you communications
that we believe may be of interest or relevance to you, based on the information we have
about you.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-section-7">7. How long do we keep your personal data?</h2>
<p>We will retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes
listed in
<a href="http://www.squawka.com/privacy-policy#privacy-section-3"><strong>Section 3</strong></a> of this Policy.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we keep your personal data during a certain period to meet for
example legal,
tax or accounting requirements.</p>
<p>We maintain a data retention policy for personal data in our care. Where your personal
data is no longer
required we will ensure it is either securely deleted or made anonymous.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-section-8">8. What are your rights?</h2>
<p>You have a number of rights in relation to your personal data. More information about
each of these
rights can be found by referring to the table set out further below.</p>
