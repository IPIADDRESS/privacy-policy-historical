Furthermore, in certain situations described below, we will provide your personally identifying information to third parties:</p>
<p>• We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, protect our interests or property, or prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the website or using our name. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, or government agencies.</p>
<p>• We may offer products or services jointly with other companies and individuals using the website. (Collectively, these may be referred to as the “Third-Party Providers.”) You understand and agree that if you use the website to connect with a Third-Party Provider, we may share your information with the applicable Third-Party Provider to facilitate your transaction.</p>

<h2>Account Security</h2>
<p>The security of your account relies on your protection of your password. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your password. You are solely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You may not share your password with anyone. We will never ask you to send your password or other sensitive information to us in an email, though we may ask you to enter this type of information on the Site.

We may have access to your password and may use such password to access your account for debugging, quality assurance, or other internal purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. In the event of an inadvertent disclosure of your personal information we will take all commercially reasonable steps to limit and remedy the disclosure as required by the applicable law.
