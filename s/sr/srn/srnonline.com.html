<p>This policy (“Privacy Policy”) informs you of the policies of Salem Communications Corporation and its subsidiary entities (collectively, “Salem”) concerning the collection, use and disclosure of personal information from this and other Salem-related websites (the “Website(s)”).

These uses, however, do not allow us to connect your IP address with your personal identity.</li>
<li><strong>What About “Cookies”?</strong>  “Cookies” are small pieces of information that your web browser stores on your computer’s hard drive which may contain personally identifying information.  From time to time our Website may place cookies on your computer’s hard drive that enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide you with certain features. Use of cookies also provides information about your web usage, which helps us compile demographic and statistical information about visitors who are utilizing our Website.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that.</li>
</ul>
<h5>3.  Updating and Deleting Personal Data:</h5>
<ul class="legal">
<li><strong>Correcting and Updating.</strong>  You may correct or update your registration data by either signing into your online account or by using the “Contact Us” link on our Website to submit such request.</li>
<li><strong>Delete/Deactivate/Opt-out of Email Subscriptions.</strong>  You may delete or deactivate your account or request not to receive emails from us by either signing into your online account or by using the “Contact Us” link on our Website and submitting a request to delete/deactivate your account or be removed from our database.  Salem will comply with all such requests within a reasonable period of time.  Please note that we may need to retain some information about you in order to satisfy our legal and security obligations; for example, some of your information may remain in backup storage even if you ask us to delete it.  In some cases, you may be entitled under local laws to access or object to the possession of information that we hold relating to you. </li>
</ul>
<h5>4.  Information Shared With Third Parties:	</h5>
<ul class="legal">
<li><strong>Information Sharing With Third Parties.</strong>  We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our Websites for their own use and subject to their own privacy policies. These companies may utilize cookies, pixels or other technologies to collect and use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., hashed data, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.  To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance at www.aboutads.info and Networking Advertising Initiative at www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
<p>    Additionally, from time to time we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by Salem to provide additional features on our Websites.  These special relationships may include “powered by” partners, business partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as “co-branded pages”). You should look for a specific privacy statement on any such co-branded page. Any personal information that you provide when signing up at one of those co-branded pages may be shared with our third party partner.  You should also check our partner’s website for information regarding its privacy policies.  Additionally, the nature of some features of our Website may require that we share personal information about you with persons or companies outside of the Salem corporate enterprise.  For example, this may occur with a feature that enables you, via our Website, to ask questions of persons or entities that are not part of the Salem enterprise.  By responding to those features of the Website, whether by email or direct entry of information on our Website, you are consenting to our transferring of that information to such persons or entities.</p></li>
<li><strong>Links to Other Sites.</strong>  When you visit Salem Websites, you may be linked to other outside sites. This includes links to sites operated by advertisers, sponsors, and partners that may use Salem’s logo as part of an agreement with Salem. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit Your Information. These other sites may be developed by people over whom Salem exercises no control and, as such, are not subject to the Salem Privacy Policy. Salem is not responsible for the privacy policies of these other sites, nor for the use of any of Your Information that these sites may collect.</li>
<li><strong>Sale of Our Company.</strong>  Salem may include any information we collect through this Website in our customer information database. This database is considered an asset owned by Salem. As in any business venture, the sale of Salem is always a possibility, either as an entire corporate entity or through an asset sale that may include our customer information database.  Should another entity ever purchase or acquire Salem or its assets, all information contained in our customer information database will be considered a transferred asset and become the property of the purchasing or acquiring entity.</li>
</ul>
<h5>5.  Specific Privacy Rights:</h5>
<ul class="legal">
<li><strong>Children’s Privacy.</strong>  Consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, this Website does not collect, use or disclose personal information (including online contact information) of children under the age of thirteen (13).  In the event that a child under the age of 13 attempts to register on our Website(s), we will not knowingly accept that registration and will delete information received from the child.  In the event that a child posts personal information in a public forum such as a chat room, we will attempt to delete that information once we become aware of it.
<p>    Parents can give written parental consent for their child to use Salem Websites, however, by completing the Salem Parental Consent Form.  To request this form, or if you have any questions or comments regarding children’s privacy at Salem, please contact us by clicking the “Contact Us” link on our Website.</p></li>
<li><strong>California Privacy Rights.</strong>  Beginning on January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of Salem who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us by clicking the “Contact Us” link on our Website.</li>
<li><strong>Canada Privacy Rights.</strong>  Beginning on July 1, 2014, consent must be given by Canadian residents to receive commercial electronic messages on behalf of all businesses unless the business has a pre-existing relationship with the consumer.  Prior to sending any commercial electronic messages to potential new consumers, the sender must obtain consent from the recipient and will need to include information that identifies the sender and enables the recipient to withdraw consent.</li>
</ul>
<h5>6.  Security and Enforcement:</h5>
<ul class="legal">
<li><strong>Information Security.</strong>  The security and confidentiality of Your Information is extremely important to us.  Accordingly, we believe we have appropriate security measures in place, consistent with standard industry practice, to protect against the unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, misuse or destruction of data.  Please be aware, however, that despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.  As such, while we want you to feel confident using the Salem Websites, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.</li>
<li><strong>Enforcement.</strong>  We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy and will respond accordingly to any formal written complaints, including, if necessary, working with the appropriate regulatory authority to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.</li>
</ul>
<h5>7.  Miscellaneous:</h5>
<ul class="legal">
<li><strong>Leased Content.</strong>  No third-party licensor shall have any liability for the accuracy or completeness of information or services provided thereby via this Website or any component thereof or for delays, inaccuracies, omissions, or other defects therein, nor for any claims or losses arising therefrom or occasioned thereby, including, without limitation, any lost profits, indirect, special, or consequential damages.

<li><strong>General Information.</strong>  This Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use for this Website shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Virginia, as it is applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within such state, without regard to conflict of law principles. You agree that any cause of action you or Salem brings to enforce this Policy and/or the Terms of Use, or in connection with any matters related to this Salem Website and/or the Privacy Policy, shall be brought only in either the state or Federal courts located in Richmond, Virginia. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Virginia for any cause of action arising out of this Policy.  If any provision of this Privacy Policy, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid or for any reason unenforceable including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, then such provision shall be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that matches, as closely as possible, the original provision, and the other provisions of this Policy shall remain in full force and effect.  The failure of either party to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this Privacy Policy shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Unless expressly provided otherwise, this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use for this Website are the entire agreement between you and Salem with respect to the use of this Salem Website and shall not be modified except in writing, signed by an authorized representative of Salem.
