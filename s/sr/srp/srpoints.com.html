				<em>Last Updated: December, 24 2014</em></div>
<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
<div>

<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				<strong>By providing us with Personal Information, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Information to the SuperRewards Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Information may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of SuperRewards and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in Canada, the United States or other countries as indicated by this Privacy Policy from time to time. </strong>&nbsp; You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time. &nbsp;However, withdrawing consent may result in your inability to continue using certain features of the SuperRewards Services.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the “<strong>SuperRewards Services</strong>” include (a) the Internet services operated by SuperRewards including surveys we run from time to time, (b) SuperRewards related portal website and other SuperRewards websites (collectively, “<strong>Site</strong>”) and (c) all software made available by SuperRewards in connection with any of the foregoing. &nbsp;Any new features added to or augmenting the SuperRewards Services are also subject to this Privacy Policy.</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;</div>

Currently, &nbsp; SuperRewards does not share your e-mail address or other Personal Information, such as name, address, gender or age, with third parties for marketing purposes without your prior consent. &nbsp; In other words, we don’t sell customer lists. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				<strong>What does this Privacy Policy apply to?</strong></div>
<div>
				By using the SuperRewards Services or submitting Personal Information to SuperRewards, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy.

Please check back from time to time to ensure that you are aware of these changes. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the SuperRewards Services will signify your acceptance of these changes.</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Information collected by SuperRewards other than Personal Information collected through the SuperRewards Services. This Privacy Policy will not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to SuperRewards through the SuperRewards Services or through any other means. All unsolicited information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and SuperRewards shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such unsolicited information to others without limitation or attribution. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				Although the use of non-personal information collected, used or disclosed through the Internet as described herein is not restricted (and to the extent that such is the case, the obligations under this Privacy Policy do not apply to such information), we provide information in this Privacy Policy about the collection of such information for the sake of transparency with respect to the operation of the SuperRewards Services.</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				<strong>How does SuperRewards collect and use Personal Information?</strong></div>
<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				We collect Personal Information from you directly when you create an account, provide information to us when signing up to use our survey system and via your corporate partners who may share Personal Information with us. &nbsp;Now, or in the future, SuperRewards may use Personal Information to create personalized content, or to tailor services and advertising on or related to the SuperRewards Services to individuals identified as likely consumers to benefit from these products or services. &nbsp;In addition, SuperRewards otherwise uses the Personal Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Information for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Information in order to obtain access to the SuperRewards Services, we will use your Personal Information to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. &nbsp;For example, if you provide demographic data and contact information when you sign up to use our survey system, we will use that information you provide to provide services to you and for other purposes identified in this policy. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				SuperRewards and its subsidiaries and affiliates may also use your Personal Information and other non-personally identifiable information collected through the SuperRewards Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the SuperRewards Services, to better understand our users and to improve the SuperRewards Services. SuperRewards and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about products or services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				<strong>Usage Statistics.</strong> &nbsp;SuperRewards may also compile Personal Information and usage statistics such as usage patterns, traffic patterns on the website and website page views and intereaction. SuperRewards may use this non-personal information (which includes data which is anonymized Personal Information) for statistical purposes to improve the SuperRewards Services and to manage our networks and systems more efficiently, for advertising purposes and share with our corporate customers and partners. Individual users cannot be identified through these reports and analytics.</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				<strong>Cookies.</strong> &nbsp;SuperRewards makes use of “cookies,” in order to identify returning users and expedite your reconnection to the network. Cookies are files that can contain specific user information, such as User ID, or they can be used to maintain a connection with you during your visit (so that you can visit pages of a site without retyping the same information over and over). SuperRewards uses cookies to track customer traffic patterns, to maintain a connection during your visit with us, to track your preferences, to diagnose problems on our servers and administer the SUPERREWARDS Services. The SuperRewards Services may make use of a session cookie which expires after a few minutes of inactivity and is automatically deleted from your computer.</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				<strong>MAC Addresses. </strong>&nbsp;The SuperRewards Services may also record and retain the MAC (Media Access Controller) address from the network card in or used with your computer or other device to enable SuperRewards to accurately perform billing and administrative functions and otherwise provide the SuperRewards Services. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				<strong>Device IDs.</strong> &nbsp;Through use of the SuperRewards Services, SuperRewards may have access to the unique device identifier for the smartphone, tablet or other device that you use the services on. &nbsp;We use this identifier for verification purposes, to customize the services and directly or through partners, serve ads that are more relevant to you, display billing options and a variety of other uses related to the SuperRewards Services.</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				<strong>Security Measures.</strong> &nbsp;The SuperRewards Services have security measures in place to protect our users, our users' data, and the integrity of our websites and online Products and Services against intrusion and subsequent loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. &nbsp;SuperRewards recommends that all users familiarize themselves with their browsers, and learn to identify and understand the differences between secure and regular connections and be aware of the implications of transmitting personal information over an insecure connection.</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				<strong>Security Limits. </strong>&nbsp;Despite the security measures described above, SuperRewards strongly recommends that its customers take measures to ensure the security of their data across any Internet connection. Like any high-speed service, including DSL and cable, the SuperRewards Services are not inherently secure. We recommend the active use of security solutions such as personal firewalls, anti-virus software, virtual private networks and encryption, though we do not provide these solutions for our users and cannot guarantee their effectiveness. It is the user's responsibility to evaluate their personal needs and workplace requirements, and obtain and properly configure appropriate security measures.</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				<strong>Tracking Unlawful Use of SuperRewards Services.</strong> &nbsp;On occasion, it may be necessary to record and trace individual usage and/or personal or technical information in order to maintain the integrity and security of the SuperRewards Services. In order to protect our users and maintain a high level of service, SuperRewards will use commercially reasonable efforts to track and identify any malicious user in contravention of our Terms of Service. To that end, SuperRewards or its representatives may track and record any information that may be considered evidence of misuse.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
<div>
				<strong>Advertisements:</strong> &nbsp;Advertisements (including banner ads) appearing through the SuperRewards Services may be delivered by us or one or more third-party web advertisers. These third party web advertisers may set cookies. These cookies allow the advertisement server operated by that third party to recognize your device each time they send you an online advertisement. Accordingly, advertisement servers may compile information about where or whether you viewed their advertisements and which advertisements you clicked on. This information allows web advertisers to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. &nbsp;The Privacy Policy applies to cookies placed on your device by us, but does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party web advertisers. &nbsp;For the privacy practices of such third-party web advertisers, you should consult the applicable privacy policy for the relevant third-party web advertiser(s).</div>
