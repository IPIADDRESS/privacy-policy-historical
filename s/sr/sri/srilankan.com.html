<h2>INTERNATIONAL DATA  TRANSFER AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS</h2>
<p>SriLankan is an international  commercial airline operating in many different jurisdictions and, accordingly, Customer  Data collected in one jurisdiction might be stored, transferred, or accessed  worldwide in different jurisdictions. The protections for  Customer Data differ from one jurisdiction to another and thus when  transferred, your Customer Data may be subject to different or lesser  protections than in your country of residence.&nbsp;  By providing your Customer Data, you acknowledge and agree to the  transfer of such Data to jurisdictions that may have lesser protections for  Customer Data.
</p><h2>CONSENT  AND UPDATES</h2>
<p>By providing information to SriLankan  or one of our service providers, you&nbsp; acknowledge  the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and you consent to be bound by  this Policy.</p>
<p>You should ensure that the information  we hold about you is current and accurate at all times.&nbsp; .&nbsp; If  you have a dedicated account with SriLankan, you may login to that account and  update your information as necessary.&nbsp; You also may have a right under applicable data  protection law to access, amend, and/or request deletion of other information  that we collect about you. To do so, please contact us at <a href="mailto:Customer@srilankan.com">Customer@srilankan.com</a>.&nbsp; In some cases, we may charge a nominal fee for  processing such a request.&nbsp; Although  SriLankan shall not be responsible for the accuracy of the Customer Data, it  shall have the right to verify the details in any request made to update  Customer Data.</p>
<p>SriLankan reserves the right to  refuse to disclose the information that we hold if any law enforcement  authority instructs us not to disclose information or, in the reasonable  opinion of SriLankan, such disclosure could otherwise be harmful to SriLankan  or any third party.&nbsp; For example, requests  made in connection with fraudulent activities or in contravention of law will  be refused. </p>
<p>You  may withdraw your consent to receive promotional emails either by unsubscribing  through the link provided in such an email or by changing the settings in your  personal account with us.
</p><h2>COOKIES</h2>
<p>SriLankan may use cookies to enhance  your experience in searching our services.&nbsp;  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are sent to your computer when  you visit websites and online services. &nbsp;If your web  browser’s preferences are set to accept it, the cookie is stored on your  computer’s hard drive.&nbsp; Cookies enable  our and other websites to  recognize your preferences and to tailor content to you.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Like many websites, SriLankan,com  does not currently respond to “do not track” browser headers. &nbsp;But you can take steps to limit tracking by  erasing cookies from your computer’s hard drive and by setting your browser to  block all cookies or warn you before a cookie is stored. &nbsp;We respect your choice to accept or reject any  cookies.&nbsp; However, your rejection of  cookies may prevent you from using some of the features on our website or  mobile services.</p>
<h2>SECURITY</h2>
<p>In order to safeguard Customer Data,  SriLankan has in place commercially reasonable technical and procedural  mechanisms.&nbsp; However, no level of  security can entirely eliminate the risk of unauthorized access or use of data collected and stored online.&nbsp; Moreover, you should take care not to disclose  your information online, including in any social media, and you should take  reasonable steps to preserve the confidentiality of your Customer Data.</p>
<p>The third party websites linked to on  SriLankan’s website are operated by third parties.&nbsp; SriLankan does not endorse any of these websites  and shall not be responsible for the information, content, accuracy, or opinions  expressed in such third party websites.&nbsp; Moreover,  when you access and use any third party website, the information that you  disclose is subject to the privacy policies of those websites, and not this  Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>REVISIONS </h2>
<p>SriLankan will amend this Privacy  Policy from time to time in accordance with applicable laws and regulations,  and the updated version will be posted on this website.&nbsp; We request that you revisit this website from  time to time for updates on the Privacy Policy.&nbsp;  The Privacy Policy may be translated into different languages, and in  the event of any inconsistency among the versions, the English version shall  prevail.</p>
