                    St-Patricks-Day.com may be just another day in the year, but 
                    it is also synonymous with Ireland and possibly the strongest 
                    Irish brand in existence. St. Patrick's Day is a time when 
                    the whole world becomes Irish and in particular the Irish 
                    diaspora thinks of visiting the ol' sod &amp; "the folks 
                    back home", and quite possibly... the best time for selling 
                    &amp; enhancing your brand internationally. <br>
                    <br>
                    Now in its 9th year, St-Patricks-Day.com, the number one ranking 
                    information website for this internationally famous day, has 
                    been relaunched as a perfect vehicle for companies aiming 
                    to capitalise on the world-wide media exposure of the "Irish".<br>
                    <br>
                    The objective of St-Patricks-Day.com is to become the world's 
                    largest online resource for Irish nationals and Irish diaspora 
                    with the bulk of the audience being Irish Americans, Irish 
                    Diaspora and people interested in Ireland.<br>
