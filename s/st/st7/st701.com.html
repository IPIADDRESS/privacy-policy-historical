        and close the browser window after use so that no unauthorized party can 
        have access. You must not, at any time, divulge your password to any third 
        party.</p>

        cookie is used to track information such as the number of users and their 
        frequency of use, profiles of users and their preferred sites. While this 
        cookie can tell us when you enter our sites and which pages you visit, it 
        cannot read data off your hard disk.</p>
