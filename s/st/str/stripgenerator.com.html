        <dd>Advertisements appearing on the Stripgenerator Site, Product or Services may be delivered to users by Stripgenerator or one of our Web advertising partners.

This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Stripgenerator and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</dd>
        <dd>Stripgenerator does not share any personally identifiable information with advertisers. Stripgenerator may share general demographic information (such as aggregated statistics about members’ interests and occupations) and non-personally identifiable information (such as browser type and IP addresses) with advertisers and partners.
