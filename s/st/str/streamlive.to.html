			<b><span style="color: #ff9600">The Information streamlive.to Collects</span></b><br>
			<br>
				  [*]User-provided Information: You may provide to streamlive.to what is generally called "personally identifiable" information (such as your name, email address, postal mailing address, home/mobile telephone number, credit card number and billing information) if you upload, purchase, or view or download certain content or products from the streamlive.to Platform, enter contests or sweepstakes, or otherwise use the features and functionality of the streamlive.to Platform.<br>

			<b><span style="color: #ff9600">When streamlive.to Discloses Information</span></b>   <br>
			 <br>
				  [*]streamlive.to does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent. Please be aware, however, that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the streamlive.to Platform Ã¢â‚¬â€œ such as when you publish content, comments or profile information Ã¢â‚¬â€œ becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.<br>
				  [*]streamlive.to may disclose Automatically Collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, or other functionality of streamlive.to.<br>
				  [*]We may disclose some limited User information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist streamlive.to in improving the streamlive.to Platform and creating new services features. We require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Notice, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.<br>

				  [*]streamlive.to may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.<br>
				  [*]streamlive.to also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; protect streamlive.to from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the streamlive.to Platform; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of streamlive.to, our Users, or others.<br>
				<br>
			<b><span style="color: #ff9600">Your Choices</span></b>  <br>
			<br>
			You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with streamlive.to, in which case streamlive.to will not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the streamlive.to Platform. You may update, correct, or delete your user information and preferences by clicking on the "Edit Settings" link on the top left of the page once you have logged in to the streamlive.to Platform.<br>
				<br>
			<br>

			To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.<br>
			 <br>
			<b><span style="color: #ff9600">Advertisers</span></b>    <br>
			<br>
			streamlive.to may allow advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you within the streamlive.to site, services and software. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. streamlive.to does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks streamlive.to to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, males age 15 to 18) or audience segment (for example, males age 15 to 18 who have participated in certain promotions) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks.<br>
				<br>
			<br>
			Some of these companies are participants in the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing and analytic companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. You can learn more about NAI and how you may "opt out" of targeted advertising delivered by NAI member ad networks here:<br>

				http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a>.<br>
				<br>
			<br>
			This Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. streamlive.to reserves the right the add or remove third-party ad networks or ad servers in its discretion and streamlive.to may not at all times list such updated ad network or ad server partners in this Privacy Notice.<br>
			<br>
			<b><span style="color: #ff9600">Our Commitment to Data Security</span></b>    <br>
			<br>
			streamlive.to uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to streamlive.to, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, streamlive.to makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.    <br>

			<br>
			If streamlive.to learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. streamlive.to may post a notice on the streamlive.to Platform if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@streamlive.to">privacy@streamlive.to</a>. <br>
			<br>

				<br>
			If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access THE streamlive.to PLATFORM at any time or in any manner.<br>
				<br>
			<br>
			Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.

				<br>
			<br>
			If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become streamlive.to Platform member, then please contact streamlive.to at <a href="mailto:privacy@streamlive.to">privacy@streamlive.to</a>.
