      <p><span>Last updated July 2, 2013.</span></p>
      <p>Welcome to Streamup, the website and online service (“<span>Service</span>”) of Streamup, Inc. (“<span>Streamup</span>,” “<span>we</span>,” or “<span>us</span>”). Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of your information.</p>
      <p>Streamup may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect the changes in our business and practices, and so you should review this page periodically.

      <p><span>International Transfer:</span> Your information may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Streamup transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
      <p><span>Video Broadcasts:</span> Video and chat sessions may be broadcast live, or recorded and re-broadcast, through third party websites.

      <p><span>Who we may share your information with:</span> We may share your information with third-party business partners (such as Facebook) to assist them in providing a better experience for you and with partners that we have engaged to help ensure site safety. You may opt out of posts to Facebook or Twitter by clicking on the “Settings” link found in the dropdown in the top right corner of the Streamup navigation bar and clicking the “Social” tab.

      <p><span>Sharing certain service type information we collect about you:</span> We may share certain service type information, including information obtained through tools such as cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.): (i) with our third-party business partners for the purposes described in the section above on “WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOW IS IT USED.” We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties.</p>
      <p><span>Ads on Streamup:</span> We may also share certain information such as your location, browser and cookie data and other data relating to your use of our Service with our business partners to deliver advertisements (“ads”) that may be of interest to you. Streamup may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content. Streamup does not sell, rent, or share the personal information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with these third-party ad servers or ad networks for such parties’ own marketing purposes.</p>
      <p>However, please note that if an advertiser is seeking to reach a particular demographic audience and you respond by clicking on the advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the demographic description of the audience they are trying to reach.</p>
      <p>The Streamup Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information.</p>
