They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content. Streamup does not sell, rent, or share the personal information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with these third-party ad servers or ad networks for such parties’ own marketing purposes.</p>

      <p>However, please note that if an advertiser is seeking to reach a particular demographic audience and you respond by clicking on the advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the demographic description of the audience they are trying to reach.</p>

      <p>The Streamup Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information.</p>
