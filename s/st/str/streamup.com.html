      <p><span>Last updated July 2, 2013.</span></p>
      <p>Welcome to Streamup, the website and online service (“<span>Service</span>”) of Streamup, Inc. (“<span>Streamup</span>,” “<span>we</span>,” or “<span>us</span>”). Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of your information.</p>
      <p>Streamup may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect the changes in our business and practices, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the policy in a material manner we will let you know and update the ‘last modified’ date at the bottom of this policy.</p>
      <p class="privacyHeading">1. What information does Streamup collect and how is it used?</p>
      <p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Service. We collect the following types of information about you:</p>
      <p><span>Information we receive through Twitter or Facebook:</span> By connecting to Streamup with Twitter or Facebook, you give us permission to access, store and use any information that you have permitted Twitter or Facebook to share with us. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on Twitter or Facebook and other third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Service.</p>
      <p><span>Information you provide us directly:</span> We ask for certain information such as your name and e-mail address when signing up. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service and to keep the site safe.</p>
      <p><span>Analytics information:</span> We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser that assist us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.</p>
      <p><span>Cookies information:</span> When you visit the Service, we or our vendors may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Streamup help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.

      <p>We will not share, rent or sell your information to third parties outside Streamup (including any parent, subsidiaries and affiliates) without your consent, except as noted in this Privacy Policy:</p>
      <p><span>International Transfer:</span> Your information may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Streamup transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
      <p><span>Video Broadcasts:</span> Video and chat sessions may be broadcast live, or recorded and re-broadcast, through third party websites. We recommend that you exercise caution in disclosing any information, personal or otherwise, during a video or chat session. Such information may be broadcast along with the relevant video or chat session to other users and third parties viewing such videos or chat sessions through the Streamup Platform and third party websites.</p>
      <p><span>Who we may share your information with:</span> We may share your information with third-party business partners (such as Facebook) to assist them in providing a better experience for you and with partners that we have engaged to help ensure site safety. You may opt out of posts to Facebook or Twitter by clicking on the “Settings” link found in the dropdown in the top right corner of the Streamup navigation bar and clicking the “Social” tab. We may share your information with agents, contractors or partners of Streamup in connection with our Services. These agents, contractors or partners are restricted from using your data in any way other than to provide services for Streamup. Our site safety team reviews User Content, including video posts and messages, for inappropriate content. Also, we may use images and video from special events for promotional and marketing purposes, but this will be disclosed to you in advance of your participation in such events and you’ll be given an opportunity to opt-out of the special event.</p>
      <p><span>What happens in the event of a change of control:</span> We may sell, assign or otherwise transfer user information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of the Streamup.</p>
      <p><span>Instances where we are required to share your information:</span> Streamup will disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms of Service or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Streamup, our Users or others. Additionally, we report all instances of suspected child pornography to the National Centers for Missing and Exploited Children (“NCMEC”).</p>
      <p><span>Sharing certain service type information we collect about you:</span> We may share certain service type information, including information obtained through tools such as cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.): (i) with our third-party business partners for the purposes described in the section above on “WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOW IS IT USED.” We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties.</p>
      <p><span>Ads on Streamup:</span> We may also share certain information such as your location, browser and cookie data and other data relating to your use of our Service with our business partners to deliver advertisements (“ads”) that may be of interest to you. Streamup may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content. Streamup does not sell, rent, or share the personal information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with these third-party ad servers or ad networks for such parties’ own marketing purposes.</p>
      <p>However, please note that if an advertiser is seeking to reach a particular demographic audience and you respond by clicking on the advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the demographic description of the audience they are trying to reach.</p>
      <p>The Streamup Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information.</p>

      <p><span>Opting out of collection of your information for Tracking / Advertising:</span> Please refer to your browser’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools.
