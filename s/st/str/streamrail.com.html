											<li>The Company will not be liable for any files or content downloaded or transferred by or between the end users. The Company will not be responsible for the accuracy, correctness and security of any of the information we gather, store and disclose.</li>
											<li>We encourage any third party to refrain from using our Services in any manner which may infringe upon other persons' proprietary or privacy rights, or any other rights. Although we do not have the ability to monitor the use of our Services, if we are aware of a breach of our standard, or of any applicable laws or regulations, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate the use of our Services.</li>
											<li><b>Personal Information</b><br>We do not collect any personal information from end users.</li>
											<li><b>Mobile Identifiers.</b> When you are using our a mobile application that incorporates our Services, we may also automatically record your Google Advertising ID (if you are using an Android device) or your Advertising Identifier (IDFA – if you are using an iOS device; together with the Google Advertising ID – "Mobile Advertising IDs"), for advertising or analytics purposes. The Google Advertising ID is an anonymous identifier, provided by Google Play services. If your device has an Advertising ID, we may collect and use it for advertising and user analytics purposes. If your device does not have Advertising ID, we may use other persistent identifiers. The information collected may be also stored on your device. Please see below how you can reset you mobile Advertising ID or opt-out of receiving targeted ads through your mobile Advertising IDs.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>What is the Purpose of collecting the information?</b><br>
										<ul>

											</ol>
											<br>
											<b>How we collect the information</b><br>
											<ul>
												<li>
													While we do not use cookies, we may use various technologies to collect and store technical information about the activity on websites, such as pixel tags, log files,web beacons or similar technologies. This information is anonymous and de-identified. We cannot use such data for the purpose of tracking or profiling any user. For your convenience, below you can find a general explanation about some of the technologies that we may use:
													<ul>
														<li><b>Pixel Tags: </b>A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website in combination with cookie to enable tracking activity on websites.</li>
														<li><b>Web Beacon: </b>A web beacon is technique used to track who is reading a web page or email, when, and from which computer.</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
												<li><b>Mobile Device Opt-Out</b> - you may opt out of receiving targeted ads on mobile devices using the Android operating system, by using platform level controls enabled through your device settings. You should consult your device settings and instructions provided by your device manufacturer. However, we provide the following information solely for informational purposes.</li>
												<li>If you have an Apple device, you can opt out of targeted advertising by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher, and setting "Limit Ad Tracking" to "ON". You can do this by clicking on Settings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Advertising, and toggling "Limit Ad Tracking" to "ON". This prevents apps that you use from using your Apple device’s Advertising Identifier to serve you targeted ads. In addition, or as an alternative, you may reset your device’s Advertising Identifier, which will result in your device being disassociated from ad targeting profiles based on the Advertising Identifier in effect prior to reset. You can do this by clicking on Settings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Advertising -&gt; Reset Advertising Identifier. Again, you should consult Apple’s support web pages and instructions for the most current applicable settings.</li>
												<li>If you have an Android device, you can opt out of targeted advertising on your device. You can do this by clicking the menu icon to display the apps list, then find and select the Google Settings icon, then find and select "Ads" and check the box "Opt out of interest-based ads". In addition, or as an alternative, you may reset your device’s Android advertising ID, which will result in your device being disassociated from ad targeting profiles based on the Android advertising ID in effect prior to reset. You can do this by clicking the menu icon to display the apps list, then find and select the Google Settings icon, then find and select "Ads" and selecting "Reset advertising ID". Note that Android settings menus may vary among device manufacturers and these instructions may not be accurate for your device. You should consult Google’s settings and instructions for the most current settings information. </li>
