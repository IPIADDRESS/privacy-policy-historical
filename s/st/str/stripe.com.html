<article>
	<h1>Welcome to Stripe!</h1>
	<p>
		Stripe (“we”, “us” or “our”) developed this service to make it easy for you to accept payments online so you can focus on your own product or service. We understand that privacy is important to our online visitors and registered users. We respect your privacy and will take reasonable steps to protect your information as if it was our own.
	</p>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy will help you understand the following:
	</p>
		<ol>
			<li><a href="#1">What does this Privacy Policy apply to?</a></li>
			<li><a href="#2">Information collection and use</a></li>
			<li><a href="#3">Sharing and disclosure of information</a></li>
			<li><a href="#4">Choice and opt-out</a></li>
			<li><a href="#5">Protection of information</a></li>
			<li><a href="#6">Notifications and changes</a></li>
			<li><a href="#7">Contact us</a></li>
		</ol>
	<p>
		Please also review, if applicable, your <a href="https://stripe.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> agreement with Stripe, which shall govern in the event of any inconsistency with this Privacy Policy.
	</p>

	<h1 id="1">1.	What does this Privacy Policy apply to?</h1>
	<p>
Stripe is located in San Francisco, California at 140 Second Street. This Policy applies to the stripe.com website, including all subpages and successor pages (collectively referred to as the “Website”), and also applies to all software and services that we offer, including through our Website when you register for a Stripe account (collectively referred to as the “Services”).
	</p>
	<p>
This Policy does not apply to any website, product or service of any third-party company even if the website links to (or from) our Website. Stripe does not operate or control those websites, products or services. Please always review the privacy practices of a company before deciding whether to provide any information.
	</p>
	<p>
By using our Website or Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Policy. If you do not agree with this Policy, delete all cookies from your browser cache after visiting our Website and do not visit or use our Website or Services. Your continued use of our Website or Services will signify your acceptance of this Policy.
	</p>
	<h1 id="2">2. Information collection and use</h1>
	<p>
	Broadly speaking, we collect information in three ways: (1) when you provide it directly to us, (2) when we obtain verification information about you or your company through trusted third parties (e.g. banks, credit bureaus) and (3) passively through technology such as “cookies”. The types of information that we collect and our use of that information will depend on whether you are a Website Visitor, Trial User, or Registered User.
	</p>
	<h2>Personal Information</h2>
	<p>
	The term “Personal Information”, as used in this Policy, refers to any information that can be used to identify a specific person, or any anonymous information (e.g. IP Address) that is linked to a specific person. Personal information does not include information that has been aggregated or made anonymous such that it can no longer be reasonably associated with a specific person.
	</p>
	<h2>Cookies and Web Server Logs</h2>
	<p>
	Similar to many commercial websites, we utilize “cookies” and other technologies to collect non-personally-identifiable information from our Website. “Cookies” are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a website. Cookies can remember what information a computer accessed on one web page to streamline activities on related web pages and to make the online experience easier and more personalized. Information gathered through cookies and web-server log files may include information such as the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, IP addresses, links to/from any page, and time spent at our site. We use cookie data to measure web traffic and usage activity on our Website for purposes of improving and enhancing the functionality of our Website. Cookies also allow our servers to remember your account information for future visits and to provide personalized and streamlined information across related pages on our Website. Log files are used to monitor, measure, analyze, improve, and troubleshoot our Services. You can choose to disable cookies for our Website but this may limit your ability to use our Website and Services; see below in <a href="#4">Section 4 (“Choice and opt-out”)</a>.
	</p>
	<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
	<p>
	To simply browse our Website, you are not required to provide any Personal Information. However, we may gather non-personally-identifiable information, as described directly above, solely for the purposes of monitoring and improving our Website and Services. We will not share this information with third parties or use it to target any advertisements to you.
	</p>
	<h2>Trial Users</h2>
	<p>
	When you visit Stripe, you have the ability to conduct a limited number of live “test” transactions and experience the Services working – without registering for a Stripe account. To monitor these test transactions, we collect your IP address, information about your computer, and other standard web log information. We also collect your Personal Information and credit card information should you provide it to conduct live test transactions. We will not use this information to target any advertisements to you. We will share and disclose the Personal Information and credit card information only as described below in <a href="#3">Section 3 (“Sharing and disclosure of information”)</a>.
	</p>
	<h2>Registered Users</h2>
	<p>
	To gain full access to our Website and Services, you must register for a Stripe account. When you register for an account, we collect Personal Information when you voluntarily provide it to us, such as the following:
	</p>
<ol>
  <li>
	  Your name, company name, location, email address, and phone number, and account password, to set up your account
	</li>
	<li>
	Your business and personal tax, social insurance, or other government-issued identification numbers, as well as your date of birth, to verify your identity for underwriting purposes.
	</li>
	<li>
	 Your bank account information, to settle funds for your transactions
	</li>
	<li>
	 Your IP addresses, devices, and locations used to access Stripe, which will be linked to your account for fraud detection/prevention purposes
	</li>
</ol>
	<p>
	We may retrieve additional Personal Information about you from third parties and other identification/verification services such as credit bureaus. In addition, with your consent, we may collect additional Personal Information in other ways including emails, surveys, and other forms of communication. Once you begin using the Service through your Stripe account, we will keep records of your transactions and collect information of your other activities related to our Services. The foregoing Personal Information will be shared and disclosed as described below in <a href="#3">Section 3 (“Sharing and disclosure of information”)</a>.
	</p>
	<h2>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
	<p>
	Our Website and Services are directed to the general public. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age or have any reasonable grounds for believing that children under the age of 13 are accessing our Website or using our Services. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected Personal Information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please <a href="https://stripe.com/help/contact">contact us</a>.
	</p>
	<h1 id="3">3.	Sharing and disclosure of information</h1>
	<p>
	Stripe does not sell or rent your Personal Information to marketers or third parties.
	</p>
	<p>
	We may share your Personal Information with trusted third parties who are integral to the operation of our Website and Services, including but not limited to financial institutions, payment processors, verification services and credit bureaus, as well as any third parties that you have directly authorized to receive your Personal Information. We may store your Personal Information in locations outside the direct control of Stripe, for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers.
	</p>
  <p>If you authorize an application to access your Stripe account using Stripe Connect, you acknowledge that we may share payment transaction data and related information with the third party that provides the authorized application. The use of your information by such third party will be subject to their applicable privacy policy, which you should carefully review.</p>
	<p>
	We may disclose your Personal Information to law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties if: (i) we are compelled to do so by subpoena, court order or other legal process, (ii) we must do so to comply with laws, statutes, rules or regulations, including credit card rules, (iii) we believe in good faith that the disclosure is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our Terms of Service.
	</p>
  <p>
Stripe may receive a subpoena or a request from a court, law-enforcement agency or other government body that seeks disclosure of your Personal Information. We will only disclose your Personal Information in response to such a request if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary to comply with applicable law or a legal obligation to which we are bound.  If we receive such a request, we will use reasonable efforts to give you prompt notice, so that you may contest it if you choose. We won’t provide you such notice if we determine in good faith that either (a) we are not permitted to provide it under applicable law, or (b) that doing so would result in an imminent risk of death, serious physical injury or significant property loss or damage to Stripe or a third party.
  </p>
	<p>
	In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar events, certain information in our possession may be transferred to our successor or assign.
	</p>
	<h1 id="4">4. Choice and opt-out</h1>
	<p>
	You can elect to not provide Personal Information, but this may limit your ability to use our Services. You can update your account information by signing on to our Website with your Stripe account.
	</p>
	<p>
	You can opt out of having your Personal Information used for purposes not directly related to our Services at the point where we ask for such information. You can also opt out of email communications by replying with unsubscribe in the subject line, or via an unsubscribe link included in such communications. You will be notified when Personal Information that you provide will be captured by third parties, so you can opt out of such services or sharing of such information.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you wish to opt out of having cookies set on your browser (as described above in <a href="#2">Section 2</a>), the only way to ensure that this happens is to manage the settings on your web browser to delete all cookies and disallow further acceptance of cookies. For more information, refer to your browser's technical information. You may also consider visiting <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org">aboutcookies.org</a>, which is a helpful informational site on cookies. Note that disabling cookies on your browser prevents Stripe from tracking your activities in relation to our Website and Services. However, it may also disable many of the features available through our Websites and Services. We therefore recommend that you leave cookies enabled.
	</p>
	<h1 id="5">5.	Protection of information</h1>
	<p>
	Although no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, we take reasonable steps to protect all Personal Information. Stripe maintains strict administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect information stored in our servers, which are located in the United States. Access to information is limited (through user/password credentials and software systems) to those employees who require it to perform their job functions. We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to safeguard the account registration process and sign-up information. Other security safeguards include but are not limited to data encryption, firewalls, and physical access controls to building and files.
	</p>
	<h1 id="6">6. Changes and notifications</h1>
	<p>
	We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to make changes to this Policy from time to time. Please review this Policy periodically to check for updates. If any changes are material and/or retroactive, we may provide additional notice and/or an opportunity to “opt-in,” as appropriate under the circumstances.
	</p>
	<p>
Stripe will provide you with disclosures and alerts regarding this Policy by posting them on our Website, by emailing the email address listed in your Stripe account, and/or by mailing to the physical address listed in your Stripe Account. You agree that electronic disclosures and notices have the same meaning and effect as if we had provided you with a paper copy. Such disclosures and notices in relation to this Policy shall be considered to be received by you within 24 hours of the time it is posted to our Website or emailed to you (unless we receive notice that the email was not delivered).
	</p>
	<h1 id="7">7. Safe Harbor Framework</h1>
	<p>
Stripe complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Stripe has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. You can learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and view Stripe’s certification, by visiting <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">export.gov</a>. If you have questions regarding Stripe’s Safe Harbor certification, please <a href="mailto:safeharbor@stripe.com">contact us</a>.
	</p>
	<h1 id="8">8. Contact us</h1>
	<p>
	If you have any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy or any of our privacy-related practices, please <a href="https://stripe.com/help/contact">contact us</a>.
