            The following sets out Streetlife's Privacy policy and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of
            your information.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Streetlife is a registered data controller - registration Z2095612. Streetlife receives your information through our various websites, SMS, APIs, services and third-parties 
            ("Services").
        </p>
        <p>
            When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure 
            and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Irrespective of which country that you reside in or create information from, your information may be used by 
            Streetlife in the United Kingdom or any other country where Streetlife operates.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are under age 18, please do not attempt to register for Streetlife or provide any personal 
            information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a person 
            under age 18, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any 
            information from a person under age 18, please contact us.

            When you create or reconfigure a Streetlife account, you provide some sensitive personal information, such 
            as a password, and credit card details. Streetlife does not store your password in a format where it can 
            ever be accessed or retrieved by our staff or agents. Streetlife does not store your credit card details. 
            These details are used only for address verification, and never stored in any of our systems, or in our 
            log data.

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
            Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our 
            Services. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Streetlife may use 
            both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to 
            monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our Services. 
            Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options,

        <h3>Links</h3>
        <p>
            Streetlife may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been

        <h3>Other sites</h3>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to Streetlife's services only. We do not exercise control over the sites 
            displayed as search results, sites that include Streetlife applications, products or services or links from 
            within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, 
            collect data or solicit personal information from you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Streetlife processes personal information on our servers in the United Kingdom and in other countries. In 
            some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal 
            information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and 
            according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners.
        </p>
        <p>
            Streetlife uses ClickTale web analytics service. ClickTale may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, 
            scrolling activity as well as any text you type in this website. ClickTale does not collect personally 
            identifiable information that you do not voluntarily enter in this website. ClickTale does not track your 
            browsing habits across web sites which do not use ClickTale services. For more information see ClickTale's 
            Privacy Policy for Information Collected by the ClickTale Web Analytics Service. We are using the 
            information collected by ClickTale service to improve the quality and usability of our site and the services 
            it provides. You can choose to disable the Service at 
            <a href="http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html" target="_blank" rel="external" class="external">http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this 
            Privacy Policy without your explicit consent and we expect that the majority of such changes will be minor. 
            Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we 
            will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy 
            changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective 
            date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
