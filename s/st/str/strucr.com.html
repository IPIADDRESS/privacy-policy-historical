				Cookies
				in order to improve the usability of our services as well as for analyzing and personalizing purposes.
				Most
				browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually refuse cookies or selectively accept certain
				cookies by adjusting the preferences in your browser. If you turn off cookies, there may some features
				of
				our site that will not be available to you and some web pages may not display properly.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>2.4.</b>
				IP Address - An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device
				(e.g.,
				computer, printer) participating in the Internet. We store the IP address only, if it is necessary to
				provide a service or if may be legally necessary.
			</p>

	</div>

	<div class="col col-12">
		<h3>3. Collection, Processing and Use of Personally Identifiable Data</h3>
		
			<p>
				<b>3.1.</b>
				We will collect, process and use personally identifiable data beyond the scope already permitted by law
				and
				without your required further consent only to the extent necessary for the conclusion and execution of a
				contractual relationship, performing requests or for billing purposes.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>3.2.</b>
				Usage data, such as information regarding start and end dates and the scope of the use of certain
				services
				and/or communication data will only be collected, processed and used if this is necessary to make
				available
				and invoice such services.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>3.3.</b>
				To protect your personally identifiable data collected and processed by us from unauthorized access and
				abuse, we have put a number of technical and organizational security measures in place. These security
				measures are monitored on a regular basis and updated according to technical progress as necessary.

			<p>

				As provided for by applicable provisions we are entitled to disclose and submit data for criminal
				prosecution and risk prevention purposes.
			</p>

				version

		<h3>4. Sending Information by Newsletter and Email</h3>
		
			<p>
				<b>4.1.</b>
				Newsletters and emails that are not service-related and contain advertisement will only be send to you,
				if
				you have given us your prior consent.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>4.2.</b>
				The content of the newsletter or email follows from its respective description. If no description is
				available, the content sent comprises information about us and our services, as well as information on
				our
				events or third party information and events.

				Third party content, such as videos from YouTube, map material from Google Maps, RSS feeds and graphics
				from
				other websites, for example, can be incorporated on the website.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>5.2.</b>
				This always presupposes that the provider of this content (hereafter referred to as the “third party
				provider”) always uses the user’s IP address. This is because without the IP address, they cannot send
				the
				content to the respective user’s browser. The IP address is thus required for displaying this content.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>5.3.</b>
				We endeavour only to use content of which the respective provider uses the IP address only for
				distributing
				the content. However, we have no influence on whether the third party provider saves the IP address for
				other purposes, such as statistical purposes, for example. If we are aware of this, we will clarify this
				in
				the following paragraphs.
