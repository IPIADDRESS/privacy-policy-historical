<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>
    The Big Think, Inc. ("Big Think") knows that you care about how your
    personal information is used and shared, and takes your privacy seriously.
    Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By
    visiting the Big Think's website at http://www.bigthink.com
    ("bigthink.com"), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you
    accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h3>
    What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
  </h3>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy covers Big Think's treatment of personally identifiable
    information ("Personal Information") that Big Think gathers when you are
    accessing bigthink.com and when you use our services. This policy does not
    apply to the practices of companies that Big Think does not own or control,
    or to individuals that Big Think does not employ or manage.
  </p>

  <h3>
    What Personal Information Does Big Think display or Collect?
  </h3>
  <p>
    The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve
    our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile
    that can be used to interact with other users through bigthink.com. In
    connection with bigthink.com, we request and display some personal
    information to other users and visitors of bigthink.com, which allows users
    to identify each other.
  </p>
  <p>
    We collect the following types of information from our users.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</em>
        We receive and store any information you enter on bigthink.com or
        provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information
        collected include or may include in the future your name, age, gender,
        e-mail address, income, and hometown. You may choose not to provide us
        with certain information, but then you may not be able to take
        advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information
        you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests
        for certain information, products and services, customizing the
        advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about
        specials and new features. You may modify or remove any of your
        personal information at any time by logging into your account and
        accessing features to edit your profile and account information.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</em>
        We receive and store certain types of information whenever you
        interact with bigthink.com or obtain services from us. Big Think
        automatically receives and records information on our server logs from
        your browser including your IP address, Big Think cookie information,
        and the page you requested. We also record the details of your
        transactions on bigthink.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such
        as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its
        components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people
        watched a particular show. Big Think only uses this data in aggregate
        form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that
        would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us
        to figure out how often users use parts of bigthink.com or services so
        that we can make bigthink.com appealing to as many users as possible,
        and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may
        provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users,
        collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so
        that our partners also understand how often people use their services
        and bigthink.com, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal
        online experience. Again, Big Think never discloses aggregate
        information to a partner in a manner that would identify you
        personally.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>E-mail Communications:</em>
        We often receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Big Think
        if your computer supports this type of program. Big Think uses this
        confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We
        also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in
        an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>
    What About Cookies?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Cookies are data that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through
    your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us
    how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Big
    Think cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine
    the general information collected through cookies with other Personal
    Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email
    address is.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which
    will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as
    (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to
    decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly
    recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies
    enable you to take advantage of some of bigthink.com's most attractive
    features.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ads appearing on bigthink.com may be delivered to users by our advertising
    partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to
    recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to
    compile information about you or others who use your computer. This
    information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted
    advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This
    Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Big Think and does not cover
    the use of cookies by any advertisers.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Will Big Think Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business.
    We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share
    your Personal Information only as described below.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</em> We anticipate that
        we may become affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely
        with them. In certain situations, these businesses may operate stores
        at bigthink.com or sell items to you through bigthink.com. In other
        situations, Big Think may provide services, or sell products jointly
        with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an
        affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we will
        share user information that is related to such transactions with that
        affiliated business.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Agents:</em> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks
        on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide
        products or services to you. Examples include sending email, analyzing
        data, and providing user services. Unless we tell you differently, Big
        Think's agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we
        share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby
        consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>User profiles:</em> User profile information including users'
        name, phone number, and email address may be displayed to other users
        to facilitate user interaction within bigthink.com. Users' full names
        will not be directly revealed to other users by Big Think, however, to
        facilitate searching Contributor Submissions, Big Think allows users
        to search for other users by using information users provide in their
        profile.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Communication in response to Contributor Submissions:</em> As part
        of bigthink.com and Services, you will receive from Big Think and
        other users e-mail and other communication relating to your
        Contributor Submissions (as defined in the Terms of Service). You
        acknowledge and agree that by posting such Contributor Submissions,
        Big Think and other users may send you e-mail and other communication
        that they determine in their sole discretion relate to your
        Contributor Submissions.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Promotional Offers:</em> Big Think allows users the option of
        having daily email alerts sent to them if there is any activity from
        other users on the ideas they have submitted to the site. Users can
        opt-in to these email alerts by choosing to receive them upon
        registration. Subsequently, users can opt out of the email alerts by
        choosing not to receive them from the settings page of their Big Think
        account.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not currently send offers to users on behalf of other
        businesses, but reserve the right to do so. However, if we do so, we
        will not give the other business your name and address. If you receive
        an offer and do not wish to do so, please send us an email to
        unsubscribe or click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the
        email.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Business Transfers:</em> In some cases, we may choose to buy or
        sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is
        typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if
        Big Think, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the
        unlikely event that Big Think goes out of business or enters
        bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
        transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
        transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Big Think may continue
        to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Protection of Big Think and Others:</em> We may release Personal
        Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to
        comply with that law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other
        agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Big Think,
        our employees, our users, or others. This includes, without
        limitation, exchanging information with other companies and
        organizations for fraud protection.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>With Your Consent:</em> Except as set forth above, you will be
        notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third
        parties, and will be given the option to prevent the sharing of this
        information.
      </p>
    </li>
