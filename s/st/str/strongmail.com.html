			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			
			<p>Use of any website controlled or maintained by StrongMail Systems, Inc. and/or StrongMail Systems UK, Ltd (currently http://www.strongmail.com and/or http://strongmailsystems.co.uk, each a "Site" and together the “Sites”) is governed by this Privacy Policy, which applies to all visits to either Site, now and in the future (as used herein, “StrongMail” or “StrongMail Systems” refers to both StrongMail entities unless the text or context indicates otherwise).</p>
		<p>StrongMail is dedicated to protecting the privacy and security of visitors to its Sites. This Privacy Policy explains how StrongMail may use information collected through its Sites. We may use personal information (such as, by way of example and not limitation, your name, e-mail address, street address, and telephone number) subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please note this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Sites online and does not impact information collected or used by StrongMail through other means, unless expressly provided otherwise. This Privacy Policy is also subject to the Terms and Conditions of Use posted on our Sites (“Terms”). If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or the Terms, please contact us at the relevant address below. </p>

				
				
			<div class="features">
				
				<h3>How we use the information we collect</h3>
				
				<p>Some pages on our Sites may ask you to provide personal information, such as when you register for access to a document or an event. In most cases, you will receive a personalized message from one of our sales representatives with more information about StrongMail's products and services, via phone or email. If you have opted in to receive email communications from StrongMail during contact with a Site or sales representative, you will receive regular newsletters about StrongMail's products and services until you opt out using one of the clearly specified methods in every email communication. </p>
				
			</div>
			
			
			<div class="features">
				
				<h3>Log files/IP addresses</h3>
				
				<p>When you visit a Site, we may automatically log your IP address (the unique address identifying your computer on the internet) which is automatically recognised by our web server. We use IP addresses to help us administer the Sites and to collect broad demographic information for aggregate use.

 </p>
				
			</div>
			
			
			
			<div class="features">
				
				<h3>Cookies</h3>
			
				<p>StrongMail may make use of "cookie" technology, which enables us to customize our Sites to better suit your preferences. Cookies are small text files from a website that are stored on your hard drive. For example, a "cookie" could store your log-in information so that you do not need to register for every subsequent download that requires a form. Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information. In all cases, you can set your browser to choose not to accept cookies (your help screen or manual should tell you how to do this), but doing so may require you to re-enter certain information at each visit, or prevent us from customizing the site's features according to your preferences. You may also delete a cookie manually from your hard drive.</p>
				
			</div>
			
			<div class="features">
				
				<h3>Third parties</h3>
				
				<p>StrongMail will never sell or share (without having first obtained your prior consent) personal information with an unaffiliated third party for any reason. Occasionally, we may share personal information such as names and email addresses with our partners to market joint products and services. Your personal information will not be provided to these partners without prior consent from you either through an "opt-in" choice at the point of collection or your positive response to a notification from us seeking your consent to share your personal information with a partner. If you do not want StrongMail to share personal information with our affiliates and business partners for the purpose of marketing joint products and services, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="mailto:privacy@strongmailsystems.com?subject=Opt-out">here</a>.</p>
				
			</div>
			
			<div class="features">
				
				<h3>Children's privacy</h3>
				
				<p>As a business-to-business email infrastructure company, StrongMail does not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. Our site is not targeted toward children under 13, nor is it designed to solicit information from children under 13. If you believe that we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected such information through our website, please notify us at the contact address below so that we may immediately delete the information from our servers. </p>
				
			</div>
			<div class="features">
				
				<h3>Security</h3>
				
				<p>StrongMail maintains industry-standard security measures in our physical facilities to prevent against the loss or misuse of all personal information collected on our website.</p>
				
			</div>
			<div class="features">
				
				<h3>Access to personal information collected by StrongMail Systems</h3>
				
				<p>StrongMail uses the personal information you provide on our site only as described above. We will not disclose any personal information without your permission unless we are legally entitled or obliged to do so (for example, if required to do so by Court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime). If at any time you would like to review this information for accuracy, or would like StrongMail to update or remove your personal information from our servers, please notify us at the contact address below with your request.</p>

			<div class="features">
				
				<h3>Transfer of assets</h3>
				
				<p>As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires us or all or substantially all of our assets, personal information, non-personal information, and any other information we have collected about the users of our Site may be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred assets. Also, if any insolvency or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.</p>
				
			</div>
			
			
			<div class="features">
				
				<h3>Transferring your personal information outside the European Economic Area</h3>
				
				<p>The information you provide to us will be held by us in the USA. The USA does not have similar data protection laws to the EEA, but we take appropriate steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.</p>
