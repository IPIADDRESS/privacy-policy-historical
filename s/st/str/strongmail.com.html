We may also use this information in aggregate form to maintain and improve our Websites and the Services and to generate and analyze statistics about our Websites and the Services and our Clients’ use of the Services (under legitimate interest, i.e. the freedom to do business)</p>
<p><strong>(b)&nbsp;<u>Cookies</u></strong>&nbsp;When our Websites are accessed, “cookies” may be placed by or for us on the visiting computer. When a Client accesses a Service by logging in using a password and/or user ID, we send a "session cookie" to that computer. This type of cookie helps us recognize visits to multiple pages on the Websites during the same session, so that we don't need to ask for a password on each page. Once a registered Client has logged out or a browser is closed, this cookie expires and no longer has any effect. We may also use longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as to display an email address on a sign-in form, to avoid the need to retype the email address on each log in to a Client account. We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them.&nbsp; You are free to decline our cookies if the browser permits, but doing so may interfere with use of our Websites.</p>
<p><strong>(c)</strong>&nbsp;<strong><u>Do Not Track</u>&nbsp;</strong>Our Services may not recognize browser-based Do Not Track signals. However, as discussed above under “Cookies,” you may be able to modify your browser settings to block all cookies, or to block “third-party” cookies. Cookies that we set on our Services are considered “first-party” cookies. Details on your ability to restrict or change the Personal Data that we may collect about you are listed below&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.selligent.com/privacy-policy#optin">Section XII (Your Choices, Including Opt-Out Options)</a></strong>&nbsp;of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>(d)&nbsp;<u>Usage Analytics</u>&nbsp;</strong>Selligent uses several third-party usage analytics tools including Google Analytics. More information about how Google Analytics is used by Selligent can be found here:&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html</a></strong>.</p>
<p>To provide Visitors with more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics, Google has developed the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to indicate that information about the website visit should not be sent to Google Analytics. The Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to the Services or to other web analytics services.</p>
<p><strong>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Location-based tools</u>&nbsp;</strong>Selligent may collect and use the geographical location of a Visitor’s or Client’s computer or mobile device, but only with the explicit consent of the Visitor or Client.&nbsp; With respect to the collection of precise information about the location of a Visitor or Client’ mobile device, once the Visitor or Client has consented to the collection, the consent may be adjusted by them by managing your location services preferences through the settings of the mobile device they are using.&nbsp; This location data is collected for the purpose of providing Visitors and Clients with information regarding Services which we believe may be of interest to Visitors or Clients based on your geographic location, and to improve our location-based Services.</p>
<p><strong>(f)&nbsp;<u>Web beacons</u>&nbsp;</strong>Selligent or its service providers may use web beacons (i.e., small image files on a web page that can be used to collect certain information from your computer, such as an IP address, the time the content was viewed, a browser type, and the existence of cookies previously set by the same server) to track the effectiveness of third party web sites that provide us with recruiting or marketing services or to gather aggregate visitor statistics and manage cookies. Selligent only uses web beacons in accordance with applicable laws.</p>
<p>If you reject the cookies associated with some web beacons, you can render them web beacons unusable, although the web beacon may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address but cookie information will not be recorded.</p>
<p>In some of our communications with prospects, Visitors or Clients, we may monitor recipient actions such as email open rates through embedded links within the messages. We collect this information to gauge interest in our Services, and to maintain and improve them.</p>
<p><strong>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Social media widgets and applications</u>&nbsp;</strong>The Services may include functionality to enable sharing via third party social media applications (such as the “Like” button on Facebook® and the widget on Twitter®). These social media applications may collect and use information regarding your use of the Services (see details on ‘Social Sharing’ cookies above). Please be aware that certain of the Personal Data that you provide via such social media applications may be collected and used by other members of that social media application and such interactions are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide the application. We do not have control over, or responsibility for, those companies or their use of your information.</p>
<p>In addition, Selligent may include blogs, forums, crowd-sourcing and other applications or services on its Websites or in social media, in its Services or otherwise online (collectively “social media features”). The purpose of social media features is to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and content. Any Personal Data that you provide on any Selligent social media feature may be shared with other users of that social media feature (unless otherwise stated at the point of collection), over whom we may have limited or no control.</p>
<p><strong>4.3&nbsp;<u>If You Become a Client Through an Agreement</u></strong></p>
<p>When you are a Client, in addition to the information collected as described in&nbsp;<u>Section 4.1</u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<u>4.2</u>, we also collect the types of information described in this&nbsp;<u>Section 4.3</u>.&nbsp; As described in&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.selligent.com/privacy-policy#customer-data">Section III&nbsp;(Client Data)</a></strong>, as part of providing the Services, we also may collect Client Data about your customers, and their clients and/or end users (including information they share about others). Client Data will be collected, used, shared and protected as set forth below and in&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.selligent.com/privacy-policy#customer-data">Section III&nbsp;(Client Data).</a></strong></p>
<p>Before permitting a Client to use a product or service, we may require such Client to provide information we can use to verify the Client’s and user’s identity, address or location, or to manage risk.</p>
<p>Such information may include without limitation, bank or credit card account information for automatic payments, taxpayer ID number, ID card or passport information or physical location of server(s).</p>
<p>We may also obtain information about a Client from third parties such as credit bureaus and identity verification services. When a Client is using a Service, we may collect information about a Client’s computer or other access devices for fraud prevention purposes. Clients will also provide Selligent with identifying information to set up and administer the Services, including authorized user identification information, and business and technical contact information, which will be used to perform the Services.</p>
<p><strong>4.4&nbsp;<u>Online Learning Programs</u></strong></p>
<p>We may also receive information from our Client’s users as a result of participation in online learning programs (“LMS”), including email address and other contact information and scoring.</p>
<p>The information from the LMS system is stored in the United States, with consent of the Client’s users.</p>
<p><strong>4.5&nbsp;<u>Blog/Message Board, email, etc</u>.</strong></p>
<p>To the extent Selligent makes available any forum for public comment, such as a blog, message board or chat space, contributors&nbsp; should be aware that any profile information disclosed by them is available to all users of the applicable forum, and is thus neither private nor confidential.</p>
<p>Selligent cannot guarantee the security of any information disclosed or communicated online in such fora, and contributors disclose any such information entirely at their own risk.</p>
<p>Selligent reserves the right at any time, in its sole discretion, to remove any content a poster may post on a blog, message board or chat space and restrict subsequent access to any such forum. Selligent further reserves the right to republish any posting to any such forum elsewhere on the Internet in any format. When Selligent is contacted via email, we answer by sending an email response to the sender.</p>
<p>We also store the email we receive for compliance with a legal obligation or to the extend it is consistent with the nature of the inquiry.</p>
<p>We will not use return email addresses for any other purpose unless you give us permission to do so.</p>
<p><strong>4.6&nbsp;<u>Additional</u></strong></p>
<p>Finally, we may collect Personal Data from or about you in other ways not specifically described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>For example, we may collect information when you respond to a survey, set your preferences, contact us through customer services or by other means, enter a contest or sweepstakes or participate in another promotional or information gathering activity.&nbsp; Any information collected through these methods shall be used as provided in any announcement related to such item(s) and if none, then in accordance with&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.selligent.com/privacy-policy#collect">Section IV 4.1&nbsp;(Voluntarily Provided)</a></strong> and provided there is an appropriate legal ground for such collection (e.g.: consent, execution of a contract, legitimate interest, i.e. the freedom to do business,…).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>V.&nbsp;<u>How We Use Personal Data</u></strong></p>
<p>Use in General. We use the information (including Personal Data) we collect from or about Visitors and Clients (including without limitation, through technologies such as those described in&nbsp;<strong>Section IV 4.3</strong>&nbsp;(Automatic Collection of Personal Data) primarily to provide better customer service to Clients, to improve and customize the content Visitors and Clients see, to help recognize Visitors and Clients when you use other devices, to provide the Services requested by Clients, and to contact Visitors and Clients about special promotions and new Services and for purposes including the following:</p>
<ul><li>

				administering orders and accounts relating to our suppliers or customers;</li>
<li>
				process transactions and send notices about Client agreements, the Services or a Client’s transactions;</li>

				resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;</li>
<li>
				prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our agreements with Clients and our<a href="https://www.selligent.com/acceptable-use-policy">&nbsp;<strong>Acceptable Use Privacy Policy(ies</strong>)</a>&nbsp;and those of contracted third parties of which Clients and Visitors have been made aware;</li>
<li>

</ul><p>The legal ground of this processing is either the necessity for the performance of the contract or the legitimate interest derived from the freedom to do business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In most cases, Visitors who voluntarily provide information will receive a personalized message from one of our sales representatives with more information about the communication, document, or event, or our Services, via phone or email. If the Visitor has opted in to receive email communications from Selligent during contact with our Websites or sales representative, the Visitor will receive regular communications from Selligent until opting out using one of the clearly specified methods in the email communication.</p>
<p>Client Data will be used and protected as set forth in&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.selligent.com/privacy-policy#customer-data">Section III (Client Data)</a></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Where and How We Store, Process and Protect Personal Data</u></strong></p>
<p>Personal Data collected is stored and processed on computers in the United States, Europe and other countries and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal, state and EU or local law and regulations.</p>
<p>We maintain adequate administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the Personal Data you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.</p>
<p>When processed as part of a hosted service, the information may be processed and stored on the servers of third party providers hired to provide the hosting, and our agreements with such parties require that they not use, disclose, or share such information. Despite Selligent's best efforts, however, security cannot be absolutely guaranteed against all threats. To the best of our ability, access to your Personal Data is limited to those who have a need to know. Those individuals who have access to the Personal Data are required to maintain the confidentiality of such information. We also make reasonable efforts to retain Personal Data only for so long as the information is necessary to comply with an individual's request or until that person asks that the information be deleted.</p>
<p>Client Data will be protected as set forth in&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.selligent.com/privacy-policy#customer-data">Section III&nbsp;(Client Data).</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VII.&nbsp;<u>How We Share Personal Data with Third Parties</u></strong></p>
<p>Selligent will not sell or rent any of your Personal Data to third parties in the normal course of doing business and only shares your Personal Data with third parties and service providers as described in this Privacy Policy. We may share your Personal Data with</p>
<ul><li>
				Members of the Selligent corporate family to provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support and relationship management), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about products, services and communications. Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you have consented.</li>
<li>
				Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations; (fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, technology services, hosting services). Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.</li>
<li>
				Credit bureaus to report outstanding negative balance accounts, as allowed by law.</li>
<li>
				In an insolvency or reorganization proceeding Personal Data may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.</li>

<li>
				Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure; or we have determined that we need to do so to comply with law;&nbsp; or we believe in good faith that the disclosure of Personal Data is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or to investigate or report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our agreements, including our service agreements with Clients, our Acceptable Use statements, or this Privacy Policy and those of our service providers; or you have given your consent or direction for us to do so.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VIII.&nbsp;<u>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS AND PRIVACY SHIELD FRAMEWORK</u></strong></p>
<p>Selligent may transfer certain Personal Data or Client Data across geographical borders to its affiliates, service providers or outside companies working with us or on our behalf.&nbsp; Selligent may also store Personal Data or Client Data in a jurisdiction other than where a Client is based and such jurisdiction may not provide the same level of protection for such Personal Data or Client Data as Client’s home country. In such case, Selligent foresees appropriate safeguards and transfer agreements.</p>
<p>By providing Personal Data and Client Data to us, Visitors and Clients are consenting to this transfer and/or storage of such Personal Data and Client Data across borders.</p>
