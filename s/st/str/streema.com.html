			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>Streema
respects your privacy. Our Policy applies to our web sites, including
http://Streema.com. This Privacy Policy explains what information we
collect through the Sites, how we use that information, and how your
rights are respected by us. The Streema Site contains links to other
web sites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of any
other companies or individuals that Streema does not control, or any
web sites that you link to from the Streema Site. You should use
caution and review the privacy policies of any sites that you visit
from ours to learn more about their information practices. Please take
a few moments to read this agreement. By accessing the Streema Site,
you agree to accept the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and
are aware that our policies may change in the future as indicated below.</p>

			<h2>Streema.com Links</h2>
			<p>In
various places on the Streema Site, we collect "Personally Identifiable
Information," such as your name, and e-mail address and other
information that can be used to contact you or identify you as an
individual. For example, we collect this information when you register
for your Streema account. From time to time in the future we may offer
additional features, services, and promotional opportunities that would
require you to submit Personally Identifiable Information to
participate. We also collect "Anonymous Information" such as your IP
address, the type of browser you use, the pages on our Sites that you
have visited, and the advertisements that you have clicked on. Your
Personally Identifiable Information is linked to your Anonymous
Information. Like many Internet sites, we also use "cookies" to collect
information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your
computer and that is stored on your hard drive. When you visit our
Site(s) the cookie identifies your computer to us so that you do not
have to re-register each time you visit. We may also use cookies to
measure the traffic to our Sites and to measure the use of different
services and features of the Sites.</p>
			<h2>Personal Use Only</h2>
			<p>Third
party sites accessible through Streema Webpages may similarly place
cookies on your computer subject only to their privacy policies. You
should visit their sites to learn about their information practices.
Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Streema's cookies.</p>

<p>Additionally, third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to our Site.  In particular, Google's use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve you ads based on your visit to our Sites and/or other sites on the Internet.  You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">advertising opt-out page</a> or, alternatively, you can opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page</a>.</p>
			<p>We
use Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to communicate
with you, to process orders for products and services (as may be
available in the future), to customize content available on the Streema
Webpages, to conduct research for internal purposes and to use such
information to improve our services and the Streema Site. We use
information that is not personally identifiable to determine how people
use our web site and its services. For example this data tells us
information including how often users click on our advertisements and
which areas of our site are the most popular. Analyzing this data
allows us to improve the offerings on and performance of our site(s).
Using your IP address, we can also determine the general physical
location of a user.</p>
			<p>Changes In Terms and Conditions: We may
modify our services from time to time, for any reason, and without
notice, including the right to terminate with or without notice,
without liability to you, any other user or any third party. We reserve
the right to modify the TOS from time to time without notice.</p>

			<p>Except
as noted below, Streema does not share your Personally Identifiable
Information with third parties unless you give us your permission or we
need to share such information in order to provide content or related
services that you have requested. For example, we may in the future
license music from 3rd parties and may want to share music-specific
traffic and usage information with them (but not your email address or
identity). We also engage third parties to assist us by tracking the
number of visitors to the Sites that have "clicked-through" from
specified promotions on third party sites and those visitors'
activities on the Streema Site or on Streema Webpages. When we supply
personally identifiable information to these third parties, we require
them to use it only for the function they are helping us with. We
aggregate the Anonymous Information that we collect and exchange it
with advertisers and others who are interested in our services. We will
disclose Personally Identifiable Information when required by law or
under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order
to conform to applicable law, comply with subpoenas, court orders or
legal process served on Streema, to establish or exercise our legal
rights or defend against legal claims, and to protect the property or
interests of Streema, its agents and employees, personal safety, or the
public. Under such circumstances, Streema may be prohibited by law,
court order or other legal process from providing notice of the
disclosure, and Streema reserves the right to not provide you with
notice in its sole discretion. If we become part of another
organization, including without limitation, by merger, change of
control, sale of assets, or other acquisition, the acquiring
organization will obtain and have access to the Personally Identifiable
Information collected by Streema and it will assume the rights and
obligations regarding your Personally Identifiable Information as
described in this Privacy Policy. If we cease operation, your
information may be transferred to and used by another company that
offers similar or related products or services. While we cannot predict
a great deal about such an unlikely event, we would hope this could
provide you continuity of service</p>
			<p>We may update this Privacy
Policy from time to time as our services change and expand. If we
update this Privacy Policy, we will notify you about significant
changes by sending a notice to the email address specified in your
account or by posting a notice of such changes on the Streema Site.
Unless otherwise provided, the revised terms will take effect on the
date they are posted. Once such changes become effective, your
continued use of the Site will signify your acceptance of the new
Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy
Policy, or any revised Privacy Policy, your sole and exclusive remedy
is to discontinue using the Site</p>
