          </span></p><p>StrikingOffers.com takes the privacy of its customers very  seriously. Please read this Privacy Statement which sets out our  Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy sets out the terms which govern the  collection, retention and processing of your personal information which  we receive when you use this site. We recommend that you regularly  check this page to review changes to this policy. Your continued use of  this website constitutes your agreement to this policy and any changes  to it. <br>
            By using and / or disclosing your personal information to us using this  website, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Statement. <br>
            We operate in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Data  Protection Principles ("the UK Data Protection Legislation"). <br>
            In instances where we collect email addresses we allow users to opt out  at any time from receiving e-mail messages from us or from having  information shared with third parties, including selected sponsors or  business partners.<br>
            We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to  third parties for marketing purposes without providing you with a  choice to opt out from such disclosure, which you can exercise during  registration for any competition or service by mailing us at any time. </p>
            <p><strong>What Personally Identifiable Information  of yours is collected</strong> <br>
              Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous  or personally identifiable.  The amount of Personally Identifiable Information that you choose to  disclose to us is completely up to you. We may at times ask you to  submit information such as your name or email address, or to share your  interests and hobbies with us. The type of information may include: <br>

              When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Netscape  Navigator(r) or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits  some information to StrikingOffers.com every time you access content  on one of our sites. Examples of such information include the URL of  the Web page you were just on (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or  Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the  browser version you are using to access our site. An IP address is a  number that is assigned to your computer when using the Internet. When  you visit this website, our servers will log your IP address which we  will use for administrative reasons. We may disclose your IP address to  our service providers. All of this information may be collected by  StrikingOffers.com and used to help improve our offerings to you.</p>
            <p><strong>Correcting Inaccuracies in the  information. </strong> <br>
              If the facility to register as a member of this website is offered you  may access your account information and public profile by means of your  user ID at any time. You will also be able to erase or deactivate your  account by sending us an e-mail at requesting us to do this. Were we  collecting personal demographic information about you we will offer the  ability to access and edit the personal information that you have  provided to us.

            <p> <strong>The Use of Cookies</strong> <br>
              We use third-party advertising cookies to serve some of the ads that  appear when you visit our Web site. A cookie is a small piece of  information stored by a website on your computer's hard drive. Cookies  are extensively used by websites as a convenient way to store  information it knows about you. These companies may use information  (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number)  about your visits to this and other Web sites to provide advertisements  about goods or services that may be of interest to you. <br>
              An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when using  the Internet. When you visit the website our servers will log your IP  address which we will use for administrative reasons. We may disclose  your IP address to our service providers. <br>
            </p>
            <p> <strong>How StrikingOffers.com uses any information  collected. </strong> <br>
              We use the personal information you supply us, including your  registration data, to enhance our services, fulfil your requests for  products, programs, or services, personalize your experience and  provide you or permit others to provide you with special offers we  think you will find valuable. We analyse the behaviour of our users,  identifying their demographic characteristics and personal interests. <br>
              We also use your registration data information in connection with the  competitions and other promotions in order to track your progress, to  notify you if you are a winner and to ensure that we comply with the  applicable laws. <br>
              We may also use the information we collect to develop summary reports  for our advertisers. We provide this information to assist our  advertisers in determining how to promote their products. We do not  tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their  advertisements unless you have told us this is acceptable. <br>
              Unless you have opted out of receiving special offers, emails or other  communications from selected third parties, we also may provide a  report to our advertiser which tells them who responded to a particular  offer. For example, we might send you an email, launch a new window  within your internet browser, or send you other advertisements in  electronic form which offer you a discount on a particular good or  service. If you click on that e-mail or advertisement or accept an  offer or discount contained therein, we may provide the advertiser with  the information necessary to provide you with that discount or offer. <br>
              StrikingOffers.com may be required by law enforcement or judicial  authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to  appropriate governmental authorities. If requested by law enforcement  or judicial authorities, we will provide this information upon receipt  of the appropriate documentation. <br>
              Other companies that place advertising on our site may collect  information about you when you view or click on their advertising or  content through the use of cookies (using the same techniques as  described above). Due to the way the Internet technically operates, we  cannot control this collection of information. As the consumer you  should contact these advertisers or content providers that place  information on the website directly if you have any questions about  their use of the information they potentially collect. <br>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Do not disclose your email or password to  unknown parties</strong> <br>
              The information that you voluntarily give over the Internet can be used  by others. We cannot control the actions of visitors or non-registered  Internet surfers. If you reveal private information, you do so at your  own risk and must assume that this information can be collected and be  used by others. You are responsible for keeping your e-mail address and  password secret. You do not have to answer any email that requires you  to give your password.</p>
            <p><strong>The passing of information to third  parties</strong> <br>
              Other than where you authorise us to disclose your personal data to  third parties, your personal data will be treated as confidential. When  you do authorise us to disclose your personal data to third parties we  will only disclose it to the extent agreed. Where you have permitted us  to pass your data to third parties, we will not be responsible for the  use of your personal data by such third parties because the behaviour  of such third parties will be outside of our control. Where your  personal data is to be transferred out of the European Union, we will  ask you for your specific consent to such transfer beforehand. In all  cases where personal data is not going to be used solely by this  website, you will be informed at the time the data is collected from  you.</p>
