	send a free SMS (or email) to the seller, your name and mobile
	number (or email) is sent to the seller in return for the seller’s
	contact information.  This is a necessary step to validate the link
	between the buyer and the seller and establish a serious intent to
	transact.  Of course, by taking the action to send a free SMS (or
	email), you consent to the sharing of this information with that
	particular seller.  It is important to emphasize that the free SMS
	(or email) you send goes only to the seller of the property or
	business you selected.</span></font></p>
