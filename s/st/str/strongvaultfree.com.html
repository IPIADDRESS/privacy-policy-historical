					</p>
					
					<p>
					The privacy of users that access our Services is very important to us, and accordingly, we have formulated the Privacy Policy (the "Policy" or "Privacy Policy") to inform you about how we intend to collect, use, disclose and protect your Personal Information (as defined below) that is received in connection with the Services. We seek to handle your Personal Information in a manner that complies fully with the privacy principles and requirements under all applicable United States federal and state privacy legislation and regulations.

					You agree and warrant that any and all of your personal information provided to us is true and correct, including, but not limited to, your name, physical or electronic mailing address, phone number, fax number and other information requested (and you agree to update the same for the duration of this Policy). You understand that all personal information provided by you to us will be subject to the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy. You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by any applicable law, or if we, in our sole and absolute discretion, believe that disclosure is reasonable or necessary to (1) comply with any applicable law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not such disclosure is affirmatively required by applicable law); or (2) protect or defend the rights or property of the Company or any third party.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Personal Information</h4>
					<p>
					The Company, including its employees, agents, independent contractors and/or representatives, will collect personal information as discussed below ("Personal Information") in a number of circumstances in the course of providing Services.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					We do or may in the future collect Personal Information in connection with the Services, such as (without limitation) when users register for Services, use the Site, provide credit card or payment information, request publications or other information from us, sign up for newsletters, participate in user posting areas (such as bulletin boards, discussion forums, and surveys) and obtain or provide user access credentials. 
					</p>

					<p>
					We may use other technologies including, but not limited to, pixel tags, web beacons, and technologies that enable us to be aware of your operating systems, hardware configurations, software applications that may be installed on your computer, and pages you visited on the Site. These technologies are employed to allow us to improve our Services. None of the information identifies you personally and we do not link aggregate information to personally identifiable information.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Use of Personal Information</h4>
					<p>
					The Company generally uses Personal Information for the following purposes: (a) identification; (b) establishment and maintenance of our relationship with you, (c) to provide you with ongoing news, publications and information, to respond to your requests and inquiries, to fulfill your requests to register for Services, use the Site, provide credit card or payment information to us, request publications or other information from us, sign up for newsletters, participate in user posting areas (such as bulletin boards, discussion forums, and surveys) and obtain or provide user access credentials.; (d) marketing purposes, such as your Site activity, browsing and usage information and/or your demographic information that you may have voluntarily provided to us, in order to better tailor our marketing activities and to implement and maintain loyalty programs; (e) providing information to third-party administrators or other providers necessary to optimize the Services; (f) maintaining business records for reasonable periods, and generally managing and administering our business; (g) meeting legal, regulatory, insurance, security and processing requirements and court or administrative orders; and (h) otherwise with consent or as permitted or required by law.

Personal Information may be used by the Company and disclosed to parties in connection with the contemplated or actual financing, securitization, insuring, sale, assignment or other disposal of all or part of the Company or our business or assets, including (without limitation) for the purposes of: permitting such parties to determine whether or not to proceed or continue with such transaction. In the event that all or part of the Company or our business or assets is sold, assigned or otherwise disposed of, Personal Information we have collected will be used and disclosed by such parties for substantially the same purposes as described in the Privacy Policy.

					<h4>The Site</h4>
					<p>
					The Company operates and maintains the Site at www.stronghold.com (and any and all sub-domains thereof). In general, you can visit the Site and view basic content while remaining anonymous by not providing any Personal Information; provided, however, we do collect your IP address and cookie information. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
					Our Site may collect non-personally identifiable information that becomes available to us as a result of your visit to our Site. This information includes, for example, your IP address (a number automatically assigned to your computer when you visit the Site, and which is logged by our servers) your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"), your web browser, the type of operating system, the domain name of the website which links you to our Site and the pages you visited while you were using the Site. 
					</p>
					
					<h4>Cookies</h4>
					<p>
					We do use cookies on the Site. Cookies are small text files that your web browser leaves on your hard drive to recognize you as a repeat user of the Site, track your use of the Site and target marketing and advertising. This allows for personalization of certain aspects of your visit to our Site. Information gathered from cookies in this way is only used on an aggregate basis. Unless a visitor specifically provides their identity to us, e.g., by registering at our Site, providing information through an online form or sending us correspondence from the Site, we will not know who the individual visitors are. We may use cookies to store preferences; record session information; develop information about Site visitors' preferences and interests; record past activity at the Site in order to provide better information when you return to our Site; or customize web page content based on information you voluntarily provide.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					You can disable cookies using your Internet browser settings. Please consult your web browser's help function for information on how to disable cookies. Note that if you disable cookies, certain features of our Site may not function properly.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Security</h4>
					<p>
					We take reasonable steps to safeguard your Personal Information and endeavor to keep it secure using security measures that are appropriate for a company and website of our scope and size in our industry. Despite these precautions, the Company cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will not obtain access to Personal Information. 
					</p>
					
					<h4>Consent</h4>
					<p>
					Consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information may be given in various ways. Consent can be express (for example, orally, electronically or on a form you may sign describing the intended uses and disclosures of Personal Information) or implied (for example, when you provide information necessary for a user access or access credentials that you have requested) or given in some circumstances where notice has been provided to you about our intentions with respect to your Personal Information and you have not withdrawn your consent for an identified purpose, such as by using an "opt out" option provided, if any. Consent may be given by your authorized representative (such as a legal guardian or a person having a power of attorney). Generally, by providing us with Personal Information, we will assume that you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of such information for the purposes identified or described in the Privacy Policy, if applicable, or otherwise at the time of collection. You may withdraw your consent to our collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information at any time by contacting us as indicated below, subject to contractual and legal restrictions and reasonable notice. Please note that if you withdraw your consent to certain uses of your Personal Information then we may no longer be able to provide you with certain of our products or services.

					</p>
					
					<p>
					The Company collects, utilizes and discloses your Personal Information with your consent, except as permitted or required by law.
