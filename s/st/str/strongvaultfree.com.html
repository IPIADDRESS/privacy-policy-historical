<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>We do use cookies on the Site. Cookies are small text files that your web browser leaves on your hard drive to recognize you as a repeat user of the Site, track your use of the Site and target marketing and advertising. This allows for personalization of certain aspects of your visit to our Site. Information gathered from cookies in this way is only used on an aggregate basis. Unless a visitor specifically provides their identity to us, e.g., by registering at our Site, providing information through an online form or sending us correspondence from the Site, we will not know who the individual visitors are. We may use cookies to store preferences; record session information; develop information about Site visitors' preferences and interests; record past activity at the Site in order to provide better information when you return to our Site; or customize web page content based on information you voluntarily provide. </p>
