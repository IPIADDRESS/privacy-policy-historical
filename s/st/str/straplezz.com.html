                <p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We have established the following personal data control mechanisms:</p>

                <h3>Promotional offers from us</h3>

                <p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage, and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services, and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).</p>
                <p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</p>

                <h3>Third-party marketing</h3>

                <p>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.</p>

                <h3>Opting out</h3>

                <p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences, by following the opt-out links on any marketing messages sent to you, or by contacting us at any time.</p>
                <p>Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, product/service experience, or other transactions.</p>

                <h3>Cookies</h3>

                <p>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies.

                <h3>Change of purpose</h3>

                <p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.</p>
                <p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>

                <h2>International transfers</h2>
                <p>Many of our external third parties are outside the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
                <p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>•   We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.

                    <li>•   Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en">European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries</a>.</li>
                    <li>•   Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en">European Commission: EU–US Privacy Shield</a>.</li>

                <h2>Data retention</h2>

                <h3>How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>

                <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>
                <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or other requirements.</p>
                <p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, and Transaction Data) for seven years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>
                <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your <a href="pages.php?id=privacy-policy#legal-rights">legal rights</a> below for further information.</p>
                <p>In some circumstances we will anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

                <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.</p>

                <h3>No fee usually required</h3>

                <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>

                <h3>What we may need from you</h3>

                <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>

                <h3>Time limit to respond</h3>

                <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

                <h2>Your California privacy rights</h2>
                <p>If you are a California resident, you may have certain additional rights. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by us to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

If you opt out from permitting your personal information to be shared, you may still receive selected offers directly from us in accordance with California law.</p>

                <h2>Do Not Track policy</h2>
                <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in your browser. DNT is a way for you to inform websites and services that you do not want certain information about your webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collect and that is why we provide you the ability to opt out. But we do not recognize or respond to any DNT signals as the Internet industry works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.

                <h2>Glossary</h2>
                <h3>Lawful Basis</h3>

                <p><strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</p>
                <p><strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>
                <p><strong>Comply with a legal obligation</strong> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.</p>

                <h3>Third Parties</h3>

                <h4>External Third Parties</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li><!-- •    -->Service providers acting as processors based in the U.S. who provide hosting, IT, and system administration services.</li>
                    <li><!-- •    -->Service providers acting as processors based in the U.S. and the UK who provide customer support services.</li>
                    <li><!-- •    -->Professional advisors acting as processors including lawyers, bankers, auditors, and insurers based in the U.S. who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance, and accounting services.</li>
                    <li><!-- •    -->Any other business partners, suppliers, service providers, subcontractors, or other third parties acting as processors based in the United States and other countries that we use to support our business (such as analytics and search engine providers that assist us with website improvements and optimizations). For example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the website (you can read more about how Google uses your personal data here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a>). You can also optout of Google Analytics here: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Your Legal Rights</h3>

                <h4>You have the right to:</h4>

                <a name="request-access"></a>
                <p><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
                <a name="request-correction"></a>
                <p><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
                <a name="request-erasure"></a>
                <p><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
                <a name="object-to-processing"></a>
                <p><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
                <a name="request-restriction"></a>
                <p><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><!-- •    -->If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</li>
                    <li><!-- •    -->Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
                    <li><!-- •    -->Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.</li>
                    <li><!-- •    -->You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
                </ul>
                <a name="request-transfer"></a>
                <p><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
                <a name="withdraw-consent"></a>
                <p><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
