            <div class="cmsbody" id="pagingwrapper"><div class="leftspace">
<p>Protection of personal privacy has always been a hallmark of Gallup. Since its inception in 1935, Gallup has maintained the anonymity of each survey respondent unless an individual user consents to the release of the user's Personal Information or individual results. In a like manner, Gallup protects the identity of individuals who access Gallup Websites. For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, the terms "Gallup, we, us, and our" refer to Gallup, Inc., 901 F Street, NW, Washington, D.C., 20004, U.S.A. For questions about this Privacy Statement or your Personal Information, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy_administrator@gallup.com">privacy_administrator@gallup.com</a>.</p>
<p>This statement describes the types of information, including Personal Information, collected and processed through Gallup websites and through the services delivered via Gallup websites, and how Gallup treats such information.</p>
<p><strong><em>Personal Information</em></strong></p>
<p>By using the term "<strong>Personal Information</strong>" in our Privacy Statement, we refer to information that you individually provide to Gallup either directly or indirectly that on its own or in combination with other information, can be used to identify you. Personal Information includes your name, your mailing address, your telephone number, and your e-mail-address, and may include other information that identifies you.<br>
Information that by itself cannot be used to identify you does not qualify as Personal Information. This includes but is not limited to your age, your gender, or other preferences.<br></p>
<p><strong>I. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY GALLUP WEBSITES</strong></p>
<p>Gallup websites gather information in two ways: (1) indirectly (for example, through our site's technology), and (2) directly (for example, when you, the site visitor, voluntarily provide information on various pages).</p>
<p><strong><em>1. Information Collected Indirectly</em></strong></p>
<p>Gallup indirectly collects a variety of information pertaining to use of our websites.</p>
<p><strong><em>1.1. Tracking Data<br></em></strong>Website traffic volume and patterns, such as the number of visitors to a given website or page on a daily basis is typically referred to as <strong>Tracking Data</strong>. This type of indirectly collected information is gathered through various means, such as an IP address, which is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you visit any Gallup Websites, our servers log your computer's IP address.</p>
<p>To obtain these Tracking Data, Gallup uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help us analyze how users use the Gallup websites. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Gallup websites (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. On behalf of us, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Gallup websites, compiling reports on website activity, and providing other services relating to website activity. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Gallup Websites.</p>
<p>You can prevent Google's collection and use of data (cookies and IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a> . In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, is the full IP address sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA.</p>
<p>Further information can be found under <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html">http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html</a> (Google Analytics Terms of Service &amp; Privacy).</p>
<p>Only designated administrators of Gallup can access the information gathered by Google Analytics, and the information is only used for administrative and planning purposes to meet the needs of our users, such as to improve the content of the site and to customize the content and/or layout of the site for individuals or groups of users.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.2. Gallup Cookies</strong></em><br>
Other types of indirectly collected information are stored in "cookies". Cookies are small files of electronic information that a website can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to help that visitor while on the site. Some Gallup websites use cookies simply to store a user code so that the user does not have to re-enter their information when re-joining the site. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet. Although most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, the decision of whether to accept them is yours. Adjust your browser settings to prevent the reception of cookies, or to provide notification whenever a cookie is sent to you. Even without accepting a cookie, users can still access most of the features offered by Gallup websites. Cookies placed by Gallup will expire when the user terminates the website session or after a reasonable period of inactivity.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>1.3. Third-Party Cookies</em></strong><br>
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may use cookies and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. You can still decide whether you want to accept these cookies. Adjust your browser settings to prevent the reception of third-party cookies, or to provide notification whenever such a third-party cookies are sent to you.<br></p>
<p><strong><em>2. Information Collected Directly</em></strong></p>
<p>Gallup also collects Personal Information and other information that users voluntarily provide. It is entirely your decision to provide the requested information.</p>
<p>Gallup keeps all information directly collected confidential, and will only use the information to contact you. You may choose to have this information removed at any time. Gallup will never barter, trade, or sell access to our database of registered users.</p>
<p><strong><em>2.1. User Account data</em></strong><br>
When setting up an account on one of the Gallup Websites ("User Account"), you may be asked to provide personal information that could include: your name, e-mail address, and your phone number. If you choose to purchase any products, services, access codes or other items for sale by Gallup, you will be asked to provide payment details and your full address for billing purposes.</p>
<p>Any User Account data will only be stored until you decide to terminate your User Account (see clause III.1. below). In case we are obliged to further store your Personal Information due to statutory retention requirements, your Personal Information will be barred for further use by Gallup and only be stored until such retention periods expire.</p>
<p><strong><em>2.2. Other Personal Information provided directly</em></strong><br>
Other Personal Information provided by you on Gallup Websites, e.g. via contact forms, or via phone will be stored in our service database and retained for the period necessary to fulfil the business need, unless a longer retention period is required by law.</p>
<p><strong>II. DATA COLLECTION</strong></p>
<p>Many Gallup websites offer users the opportunity to participate in surveys or assessments via the internet. You can find information about the purpose and process for each of these surveys or assessments on Gallup's website at <a href="http://www.gallup.com/">http://www.gallup.com/</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>1. Access to your Survey or Assessment Results from another User Account</em></strong><br>
Another Online user may purchase an access code to a Gallup survey or assessment for you. Please note that when participating in a survey or assessment, your results will also be accessible to the online user who purchased the Gallup access code. The data accessible to that account holder may include your name and your results, but will not include your specific answers to individual questions within the survey or assessment. In addition, the account holder cannot modify, alter or delete any of your results or User Account data.</p>
<p>After completion of the survey or assessment, you will at all times have the opportunity to change your settings for sharing your results with other account holders.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>2. Sharing your Survey Results with other people</em></strong><br>
After completion of the survey or assessment, you may have the opportunity share your survey or assessment results via e-mail, or social networks. Please note that only your name and results will be displayed. By sharing your information from your Gallup account with any social media service, you are authorizing us to share information we collect from and about you with the social media service provider, other users, and your friends, and you understand that the social media service's use of the shared information will be governed by the social media service's privacy policy. If you do not want your personal information shared in this way, please do not connect your Gallup information to a social media service provider.<br></p>
<p><strong>III. GENERAL INFORMATION ON COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>1. Correcting and Changing User Information and Preferences; Deletion of User Accounts</em></strong><br>
If you have given your consent to receiving e-mail communications from Gallup but wish to discontinue this service, you may request to do so at any time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:Privacy_Administrator@Gallup.com">Privacy_Administrator@Gallup.com</a>. In addition, as a registered user, you can change your settings within your User Account under "MY ACCOUNT" by updating your "Contact Me"-settings.</p>
<p>You also have the option at all times to have your User Accounts deleted for any of the Gallup websites or to request a revision of your user information at any time by emailing the requested changes to <a href="mailto:Privacy_Administrator@Gallup.com">Privacy_Administrator@Gallup.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>2. Information Security</em></strong><br>
Gallup employees understand the need for user privacy, and we maintain strict security procedures to protect your information. Gallup has appointed a Privacy Policy Administrator to monitor privacy practices. Access to user data is strictly limited to specific individuals who are trained to respect user privacy. The access given to these employees is restricted to their need of such information for business reasons. A log of those who accessed the data is maintained and monitored to prevent security breaches.</p>
<p><strong><em>3. Third-Party Information Storage</em></strong><br>
Some information may be stored for Gallup by authorized third-party companies. These companies are carefully selected by Gallup and only act on behalf of and as instructed by Gallup. We limit such third parties in their access to and use of your personal information, and like Gallup, they will never barter, trade, or sell access to your information.</p>
<p><strong><em>4. Children and Privacy</em></strong><br>
Gallup encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children. Gallup sites will not contain content that is generally considered unsuitable for children.</p>
<p><strong><em>5. Links to Other Sites</em></strong><br>
