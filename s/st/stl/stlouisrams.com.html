Sweepstakes: We periodically operate contests and sweepstakes through the 

Website that may require registration or the submission of personal 

information.&nbsp; Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity 

to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website.&nbsp; Your 

personally identifiable information may be used to contact you for winner 

notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes, (see the 

rules of each contest for details about how your personal information will be 

used).&nbsp; We may also ask your permission to allow us to publicly post some 

of your information on the Website, such as on a winner’s page, in the event you 

win a contest or sweepstakes.&nbsp; Except as required by applicable law, we 

will not post your information without your permission.&nbsp; In some instances, 

a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes 

on the Website, and collect your information.&nbsp; In those cases, where we are 

not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we do not collect your 

information and we have no control over the information collected from 

you.&nbsp; Accordingly, we urge you to review the advertiser's or sponsor's 

privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before 

participating.&nbsp; <br><br>Our website offers promotions that involve other 

parties, to varying degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is how we treat user information 

in each type of promotion:<br><br>1.&nbsp;Promotions run by the Rams and we do 

not share information with 3rd party sponsor:&nbsp; In these cases, the Rams 

collect all relevant information from users such as name, email, mailing 

address, email type, favorite player, gender, birth date.&nbsp; In these 

promotions, the Rams privacy policy applies.&nbsp; The Rams do not share this 

information with any 3rd parties.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">2.&nbsp;Promotions run by the Rams, but collected information 

may be used by the Rams and/or 3rd party sponsor:&nbsp; In these cases, the Rams 

collect all relevant information from users such as name, email, mailing 

address, email type, favorite player, gender, birth date.&nbsp; Users will be 

given the option to allow the 3rd party sponsor to see their information.&nbsp; 

This option will be signified by checking a checkbox that reads “Receive email 

from the St. Louis Rams regarding special offers from the Rams and our 

partners.”&nbsp;&nbsp; In these cases, the 3rd party sponsor may see the 

information.&nbsp; Once the information is transferred to the 3rd party, the 3rd 

party’s privacy policy applies.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">3.&nbsp;Promotions where the 3rd party collects the 

information:&nbsp; In these cases, the Rams do not collect the 

information.&nbsp; The page upon which the registration occurs will clearly look 

like the 3rd party’s website, and not the Rams.&nbsp; The 3rd party’s privacy 

policy will apply to collected information.&nbsp; In some cases, the 3rd party 

may provide some information back to the Rams.&nbsp; This will only occur if the 

user chooses to allow the Rams to see the information.&nbsp; When the 

information is transferred to the Rams, the Rams privacy policy will 

apply.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Surveys or Voting: From time-to-time we may request personally 

identifiable information from you in conjunction with a survey or voting poll. 

Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether 

or not to disclose information to the Website.&nbsp; <br><br>Games: When you

identifiable information.&nbsp; <br><br>Cookies:&nbsp; As with many Websites, 

our Website uses a technology called "cookies."&nbsp; A cookie is a unique, 

random number that is stored in the browser on your computer. The cookie doesn't 

actually identify you, just the computer that is used to visit the site. Cookies 

automatically identify your browser to the Website whenever your computer is 

used to visit the Website.&nbsp; Cookies also let us know how many people visit 

our website and where visitors go on the site. In addition, cookies can let us 

know non-personally identifiable information, like what web browser is being 

used to access the website. For registered users, cookies can make using the 

Website easier for you by saving information such as your passwords or 

preferences.&nbsp; By tracking how and when you use the Website, cookies help us 

determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and 

updates to the Website are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting 

cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the

addresses and/or click-stream data. An IP address is a number associated with 

the service through which you access the Internet, like your ISP (Internet 

service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP 

address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses for 

purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our 

advertisers and sponsors, for example regarding the frequency with which our 

guests visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with 

personally identifiable information.&nbsp; Click-stream data is information 

collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Website. 

Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the 

source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding 

page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data 

helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Website, what type of content is 

most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in 

particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.<br><br>Transaction 

Information: If you conduct a financial transaction with our Website, such as 

purchasing merchandise in our pro shop, purchasing tickets to promotional and 

community events, purchasing tickets through the Rams/Ticketmaster system or 

subscribing to services offered on our Website, we will ask you to complete an 

order form that will request certain information from you, including contact 

information, demographic information and financial information.&nbsp; We will 

use this information to complete the transaction that you have requested, i.e., 

to deliver the information, products or other services that you order, and to 

invoice you.&nbsp; For your protection, such information is collected and stored 

through encrypted means.<br></font></p>

SHARED</strong><br><br>At times, we may share your personal information with 

others for various purposes.&nbsp; The following outlines the ways in which your

Services: In the future, the Website may use a third party network advertiser to 

serve the advertisements on the Website or may use a traffic measurement service 

to analyze the traffic on the Website. Network advertisers are third parties 

that display advertisements based on your visits to this Website and other 

Websites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target 

advertisements to you for products or Websites you might be interested in. 

Audience and Traffic Measurement Services allow us to collect anonymous traffic 

and behavior information from our Website by monitoring anonymous visitor 

activity. Although advertisers or other companies do not have access to the 

Website cookies, the Website's advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement 

services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you 

choose to have your cookies enabled in your browser. Cookies allow third party 

advertisers to show you advertisements or content you might be interested in. 

Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy 

policies.&nbsp; Currently, the Rams do not employ 3rd parties to handle these 

services.<br><br>Business Transfers:&nbsp; In the event that all or 

substantially all of our assets are sold or transferred to another party, or 

another transaction occurs in which your personally identifiable information is 

one of the business assets transferred, all personally identifiable information 

that has been collected and saved may be one of the business assets we transfer.

links from advertisers, sponsors and marketing partners that may use the 

Website's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Websites may send 

their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal 

information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you
