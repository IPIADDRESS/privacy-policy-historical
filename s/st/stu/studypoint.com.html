					<p>The identifiable information that you provide to us is used to provide you with the information you requested about our educational services and ensure that we offer services within your geographic location. Should you choose to enroll in one of our programs, the information may also be used for billing purposes. (Note: enrolling in our tutoring programs must be done over the phone with one of our consultants. We do not accept online enrollments at this time. The consultant would be able to confirm the information that was given to us by you through the website). Occasionally, contact information that you have provided us may be used to inform you about limited-time promotions that we are offering, or other information regarding tutoring, test preparation, college applications or other related topics.

For any information received via mail, receivers can opt out by calling one of our consultants and being asked to be taken off the list. This is done by sharing with us your contact information, exactly as it appears on the mailing piece you received. At StudyPoint, we process multiple mailings at a time; therefore any requests to be taken off mailing lists may take 6 to 8 weeks to process. If you would like to continue receiving information from StudyPoint, but need to correct or update any personal information, please call one of our consultants.</p>
