<h1>Your Privacy</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Our most important asset is our relationship with you, and we want you to feel comfortable and secure when using our Website. Rest assured that we are serious about the protection of your personal information.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Student Registration and Customer Service</h2>

<p>You do not have to register in order to use this Web site, but registration does provide you with additional benefits. Specifically, registration allows us to store your grades, and to retrieve and display those grades to you and/or your teacher, as well as to provide you with additional content that is not available to non-members.</p>

<p>If you register as a student, we ask you for your email address and we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.</p>

<h2>Strictly "Opt-In"</h2>

<p>Regarding newsletters, special offers, surveys, etc. our policy is simple: we will only send you these messages if you choose to opt in to our mailing list.</p>

<h2>Surveys</h2>

<p>If you choose to participate in a survey, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in surveys is completely voluntary. The requested information typically includes contact information such as name and email address. We use this information to improve our Web site.</p>

<h2>Opting Out</h2>

<p>If you have previously opted in to our mailing list, and wish to discontinue receiving promotional messages and newsletters, you can opt out by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each newsletter or promotional email, or by contacting us at the address at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h2>Orders</h2>

<p>If you purchase a product or service from us, we will request contact information such as name, email, and shipping address, and financial information such as credit card number and expiration date. Additionally, if your purchase includes access to premium content, a password-protected account will be created for you so that you can access that content.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>The security of your personal information is very important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt that information using advanced secure socket layer technology (SSL). This SSL software is licensed from Tustwave, a global leader that provides high-quality security solutions to organizations throughout the world.</p>

<h2>Service Providers</h2>

<p>We use other third parties to provide credit card processing and shipping services on our site. When you purchase a product, we will share credit card and contact information as necessary for the third party to provide that service.</p>

<p>These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose including their own marketing purposes.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies contain information that can be read by a web server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.</p> 

<p>Like many sites, we also use cookies. When you log on to our site, we use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site by allowing you to move from page to page without having to log on again on each page. When you log off these cookies are deleted from your computer. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. You can set your browser to reject cookies, but if you do you may not be able to log on or use all of the features of this website.</p>

<p>We use a third-party tracking service called Google Analytics and a third-party advertising service called Google AdSense. Google is firmly committed to the privacy of their advertisers and users. While Google does use cookies, Google does not associate a user's search activity with his/her ad click history. Further, Google does not collect or track personally identifying information, and does not reveal individual information to other third parties.</p>

<h2>Log Files</h2>

<p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, Internet Service Provider, and date/time stamp. When you register, we collect date, time and originating IP address for verification purposes.</p>

<h2>Service Announcements</h2>

<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if your account is about to expire due to inactivity, we will send you a warning prior to deleting your records. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option of deactivating your account.</p>

<h2>Using a "Teacher ID"</h2>

<p>Sometimes a student will use this website at the request of their teacher. In these cases, the student may elect to enter a "Teacher ID" into their student profile. When the student enters a Teacher ID into their student profile, they are enabling that teacher to view their name, email address, and their recorded grades.</p>

<p>The student controls this access by choosing whether or not to enter a Teacher ID into their student profile. The student can disable the teacher's access at any time by removing the Teacher ID from their student profile. The teacher can also cause the Teacher ID to be removed from the student's profile by deleting the student from their list of students.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>

<p>This website is not targeted to children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If a child under 13 submits personal information and we learn that that personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>

<h2>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h2>

<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, you may correct it by making the change on your "My Account" page or by contacting us at the address below.</p>

<h2>Supplementation of Teacher Information</h2>

<p>If you register as a teacher, we collect various information such as email, name, school name and address and phone number. We collect this information so that we can confirm that you actually are a teacher.</p>

<p>Sometimes we offer educational discounts to bonafide Spanish teachers. In order to qualify teachers for educational discounts, we may call or email the teacher's employer for the purpose of verifying the teacher's credentials as a Spanish teacher.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

<p>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Study Languages, LLC. As you would expect, we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.</p>

<h2>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h2>

<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
