    <span class="HEADLINE"><font size="6" color="#666666"><b>Student.Com Privacy Policy</b></font></span><br>

    <font face="Times"><i>Except in the limited circumstances stated below, Student.Com will never intentionally disclose individually identifying
information about its members to any third party without that member's
permission.</i></font><br>
    <p>
    </p><div class="BODYTEXT"><font face="Times">
    
    <b>Where do we gather information from you and what do we do with it?</b>

<p>
When you sign up to be a Student.Com Member, we ask you questions
about yourself. A few of those questions are mandatory to receive a
Student.Com Member Name. In order to enter Student.Com contests, you
must answer more of the questions (for instance, we need to know your
address so we can mail you a prize if you win one). In order to
receive certain benefits of Student.Com membership, like free e-mail,
you must answer some of the questions and give us permission to share
that information with our partners like our free e-mail provider. The
information is shared with our partners solely to provide you with the
services that they offer.

</p><p>
Additionally, we use this information you provide to tailor the site
to you and provide a more comprehensive interactive experience. For
example, when you tell us what school you go to, we show you links and
content relevant to your school and where you are.

</p><p>
We use cookies, which let us offer features like personals and
discussions, where you can contribute to the site. We need a way to
make sure that no one else can provide information and pretend to be
you. Our cookie is just a small text file - shorter than this sentence
- that your browser sends to our server when it asks for a page on
Student.Com. We only send you one cookie - a lot less than many other
sites - but you may receive additional cookies from companies that
advertise on Student.Com, a process that Student.Com has no control
over. Keep in mind that because these anonymous cookies are not
from Student.Com, those advertisers can't link them with any personal
information you provide to Student.Com.

</p><p>
We keep track of how Student.Com is accessed. When you request a page
from our servers, we store that request and the time you made it,
along with the cookie that we've assigned you and the IP address of
the computer that made the request. (An IP address is a unique number
assigned to every computer on the Internet that other computers, like
our servers, use to identify and send data to that computer.) We keep
track of these requests in pretty much the same way that every
commercial web site out there does. This access information helps us
figure out what the most and least popular parts of the site are, so
we can make more of the most popular things and less of the least
popular things. It also helps us plan the site's growth, so we can
make sure we have enough powerful computers to serve you pages
speedily.

</p><p>
Keep in mind that there are other places on Student.Com, such as
discussions and chat, where you may have the opportunity to disclose
personal information to other Members or, such as in Personalities,
display information in a way that is publically accessible. While our
Web Site Agreement forbids people from commercially using that
information, you should be aware that it is publically accessible.

</p><p>
<b>How else do we use the information?</b>

</p><p>
We send you periodic e-mail messages about what's happening at
Student.Com. This e-mail is only sent to Members who specifically
request it when they sign up or edit their <a href="/feature/memberprofile">Member Profile</a>, and you can opt in
or out at any time.

</p><p>
We present reports, in aggregate, to potential and current advertisers
about what kinds of people will see or have seen their ads. For
example, we might say something to an advertiser like "We could show
your ad to 150,000 Phys Ed majors" or "Yesterday, 29,000 people
clicked on your ad, and 10% of them go to school in California." Being
able to provide this kind of information to advertisers lets us keep
Student.Com completely free to you. Remember that without your
consent, we never tell advertisers information that
individually identifies you, such as your Student.Com Member Name or
your e-mail address.

</p><p>
We may, however, disclose information that individually identifies
you to third parties when we have reason to believe that
disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or
bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or
interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our
rights or property, other members or users of Student.Com, or
anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.  We may also
disclose such information to third parties when we believe in good
faith that the law requires it.

</p><p>
<b>Can you opt out?</b>

</p><p>
Yes. When you sign up, or when you edit your <a href="/feature/memberprofile">Member Profile</a>, you can choose not
to receive periodic e-mail messages from Student.Com. When you sign
up, you can choose not to give us permission to share some of your
information with our partners. You can also <a href="/feature/noemail">put yourself on our No E-Mail list</a>, which
will prevent you from receiving e-mail from features where other
members supply e-mail addresses, like our Reject-O-Matic.

</p><p>
<b>Can you edit your personal information?</b>

</p><p>
Yes. The Student.Com <a href="/feature/memberprofile">Member
Profile Editor</a> lets you edit the personal information you've
provided to us.

</p><p>
<b>Can you deactivate your personal information?</b>

</p><p>
Yes. You can <a href="mailto:webmaster@student.com?subject=deactivate+me">write to the
Student.Com webmaster</a> to deactivate your account. This will
prevent the account from being used on Student.Com. However, any
messages you've posted to Student.Com Discussions will remain on the
site.

</p><p>
<b>Do we collect individually identifying information from children under the 
age of 13?</b>

</p></font><p><font face="Times">
Student.Com is not directed at individuals under thirteen years of
age, and we do not intentionally collect any individually
identifying information from such individuals.
