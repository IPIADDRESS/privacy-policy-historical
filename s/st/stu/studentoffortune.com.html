<h2><a name="info">Information Collection and Use</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Registration and Profile Information</li>
<p>
When you register with us or choose to participate in one of our features on
our Sites or otherwise interact with us, you may be asked or required to
provide certain information, which may include Personal Information (which
is information that can be used to identify or contact a specific
individual, such as your name and email address), account information (such
as a password or other information that helps us confirm that it is you
accessing your account) and demographic or other information (such as your
school, gender, age or birthdate and zip code).  We will also collect
payment information (typically, credit card account information) if you
choose to purchase products or services through the Services.  Any
information combined with Personal Information will be treated as Personal
Information.
</p>
<p>
You may have the opportunity to create a public profile that is available to
others on the internet (“Public Profile”), through which you can
post or upload information about yourself, which may include a photograph,
information about your academic and work history, your interests and
activities and other information. Your Public Profile may be indexed by and
displayed by internet search providers when someone searches for your name. 
Chegg does not control how frequently third-party search engines update
their indexes; consequently their information may be outdated and still
available for a period of time even after you discontinue use of the
service.  If you do not want your information to be viewable by educational
institutions or related third parties, you may close your account.
</p>
<p>
We use information about you, including Personal information and the
information you provide  in your Public Profile to:  (1) allow you to
participate in features we offer or to provide related customer service,
including, without limitation, to respond to your questions, complaints or
comments; (2) tailor content recommendations and offers we display to you;
(3) process a transaction you initiate; (4) provide you with information,
products or services; (5) send you special offers from us, our advertisers,
or third-party business partners; (6) process your registration with our
Services, including verifying your e-mail address is active and valid; (7)
improve the Services and for internal business purposes; (8) contact you
with regard to your use of the Services and, in our discretion, changes to
our policies; and (9) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your
information or otherwise with your consent. 
<strong>Note that on Zinch.com, educational organizations, scholarship
providers and similar third parties will be able to review your Full Profile
, whether or not you have limited public access to certain information in
your Public Profile.  Chegg does not share your contact information with
those third parties unless you request or agree to that sharing.  However,
Chegg may send you information and offers from third parties and information
about the Services and you may not be able to opt-out from these messages
without closing your account with Zinch.com.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Note about Children: Our services are not intended for, marketed to or
available to individuals younger than the age of 13, and individuals younger
than the age of 13 should not submit personal information to us.
</p><li>Community Forums, User Content, and Posting Content To Third Party
Sites</li>
<p>
The Sites may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content
publicly in forums, through interactive features and through other
communication functionality ("Community Forums").  You may choose, through
such features or otherwise, to submit or post photographs, videos,
questions, comments, suggestions or other content, (collectively, "User
Content").  Your User Content may also be posted in your Public Profile. 
You may edit or remove information on your profile.  You may contact Chegg
to remove information that you have posted publicly in forums.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<span style="font-style: italic;">
Note that anything you post to a Community Forum or in your Public Profile
is public
-- others will have access to your User Content and may use it or share it
with third parties. Information you choose to post or make available in the
Community Forums may be viewed, collected and used by others. If you choose
to voluntarily disclose Personal Information in your Public Profile or a
Community Forum, that information will be considered public information and
the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply. Think carefully
before you post and use caution before publicly disclosing any Personal
Information.
</span></strong>
</p>
In addition, you may have the ability to contact another user through the
Services or “follow” or “friend” other users.  When
you contact another user, we may list your name in the header of the message
or in the wall post or notification, but we will not include your personal
email address.  We allow other users to use contact information they have
about you, such as your email address, to find you, including through
contact importers and search, and they may also contact you through the
Services. 
<p></p>
<p>
Also, the Services may permit interactions between the Services and a third
party web site, such as enabling you to “like” a product within
our Services or “share” content to other web sites.  If you
choose to “like” or “share” content or to otherwise
post information from or via the Services to a third party web site, feature
or application, that information will become public and the third party web
site may have access to information about you and your use of our Services.
These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on
our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.
Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or
hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are
governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
</p>
<li> Information Third Parties Provide About You And Social Media
Platforms</li>
<p>
Third parties may provide us with information about you. For example, if you
are on a third party web site, and you opt-in to receive information from
us, that third party will forward information about you to us so that we may
contact you as requested. You may also choose to participate in a third
party application or feature through our Services (such as logging in
through Facebook Connect or otherwise linking the Services with another web
site or interactive service) or on a third party web site or service (such
as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a
third party web site or service) through which you allow us to collect (or
the third party to share) information about you, including personal
information. When you choose to participate, you may be opting to link your
activity on our Services with that third party web site or service, which
may then collect information about your visits to our Services and may
publish that activity as you request to your profile or similar feature with
that third party (such as if you choose to share a purchase you made on
Chegg.com with your connections on the third party web site).  The
information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information
collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third
party’s privacy practices, including whether the third party continues
to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your
choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party web
site and service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or
feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you
through the application or feature, but we may retain the information
previously collected. In addition, we may receive information about you if
other users of a third party web site or service give us access to their
profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information
about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web
page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third
party web site or interactive service.  Chegg does not store the information
in those circumstances.
</p>
<p>
We also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from
third parties in order to provide you with information, services or goods
you have requested. We may combine the information we receive from those
other sources with information we collect through the Services. In those
cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.
</p>
<li>Referral Features and Gift Certificates</li>
<p>
The Services may offer referral features whereby users may use an email tool
to invite friends to use the Services using a one-time email. Chegg stores
this information for the purpose of verification, as well as tracking the
success of our referral program. Chegg will not use those referred email
addresses for any other purpose (unless, of course, the referred user comes
to a Service and registers as a user, in which case Chegg may use the email
address provided by the referred user in accordance with this Privacy
Policy). The referred person may contact us at <a href="mailto:legaldept@chegg.com">legaldept@chegg.com</a>  to request that
we remove this information from our database.
</p>
<p>
If you purchase a gift certificate for another person, we will ask you for
that person's name and email address, as well as for an optional personal
message. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email including
an invitation to visit the site as well as their gift code. Chegg stores
information such as the gift certificate recipient's name and email address
for the sole purpose of verification. Chegg does not sell or disclose any of
this information to any outside sources or parties and collects this
information only to maintain records that a gift certificate was purchased
and sent to a recipient. Vouchers purchased through Cheggdeals are not gift
certificates and must be used according to the terms of the voucher.
</p>
<li>Information Chegg Collects Automatically When You Access The
Services</li>
<p>
Like other websites and online services, we and our analytics providers and
other third party service providers may collect certain “Usage
Information” whenever you access and use the Services.  Usage
Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the
URL or advertisement that referred you to our Services, the search terms you
entered into a search engine that lead you to our Services (if applicable),
all of the areas within our Services that you visit, and the time of day,
among other information. We may use Usage Information for a variety of
purposes, including enhancing or otherwise improving the Services and our
products and services.
</p>
<p>
In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique
identifier (“Device Identifier”) for any computer, mobile phone
or other device (any, a “Device”) you may use to access the
Services. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to
your Device used to access a Service, and our servers identify your Device
by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us
or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical
location of the Device used to access a Service. Usage Information is
generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and
identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
Usage Information is collected via tracking technologies, including:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies and Log Files:</strong>
Like most websites, Chegg uses cookies and web log files to track usage of
our Services. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer,
and which allows Chegg to recognize you as a user when you return using the
same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do not allow
cookies, you will not be able to use our Services as fully as intended. Log
files are the record of your visits to the Services and include Usage
Information.  Like the information you enter at registration or in your
Public Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your
experience when you use the Services.
</p>
<p>
One type of cookie we use, known as a “persistent” cookie, is
set once you’ve logged in to your account on the Services. If you do
not log out of your account, then the next time you visit, the persistent
cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not
need to log in before using the Services. Of course, if you are using a
public computer or sharing your private computer with others, you should log
out of your account after each visit. If you log out of a Service, you will
need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to
your account. We also use a cookie which functions as a
“session” cookie, meaning that it is used to identify a
particular visit. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you
close your web browser.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Web Beacons:</strong>
We, as well as our affiliate program partners, third-party tracking utility
companies, and service providers employ a software technology called clear
gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs), that help us better manage content on
our site by informing us of what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny
graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are
used to track the online movements of web users for our affiliate program.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard
drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size
of the period at the end of this sentence. This information is used to help
improve the overall quality and experience of our website.
</p>
<p>
An <strong>Embedded Script</strong> is programming code that is designed to
collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the
links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or
other device from our server or a third party service provider and is
deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Services.
</p>
<p>
In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar
information for security and fraud detection purposes.
</p>
<h2><a name="thirdparty">THIRD PARTY Ad Networks And ANALYTICS
PROVIDERS</a></h2>
<p>
Chegg works with network advertisers, ad agencies , third party traffic
measurement services and other vendors to serve third party advertisements
on and through the Services, to provide us with information regarding
traffic on the Services, including the pages viewed and the actions users
take when visiting the Services; to serve our advertisements on other web
sites, within third party applications, and across the Internet; and to
provide us with information regarding the use of the Services and the
effectiveness of our advertisements. For example, if you clicked on an
advertisement that led you to one of our Services, our service provider(s)
may be able to tell us which advertisement you clicked on and where you were
viewing the advertisement.  In connection with providing analytics and
advertisement services, our service providers may collect certain
information about your visits to this or other web sites. We do not share
Personal Information with these service providers, but they may set and
access their own tracking technologies on your Device (including cookies and
web beacons) and may otherwise collect or have access to information about
you (such as your general interest in higher education and scholarships and
Usage Information). 
</p>
<p>
With regard to advertisements, we and our network advertisers may target
advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested
based on your visits to both the Services and other web sites. Tracking
technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, including those set by third
party network advertisers, may be used to, among other things, target
advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many
times, or to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain
advertisements to you. We may share Usage Information about visitors with
third party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors for
similar purposes.  We may use a variety of companies to serve
advertisements. You may wish to visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>,
which provides information regarding the "opt-out" procedures of certain
third party ad servers we may use. 
</p>
<p>
Chegg also works with Truste which gives you the ability to opt out of some
or all tailored advertising networks. To learn more about the use of this
information or choose not to have this information used by our third-party
advertising partners by opting out, please visit the <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/truste/">Truste website</a> here.
</p>
<h2><a name="mobile">MOBILE USE</a></h2>
<p>
If you use the Services through a mobile device or our mobile application,
your mobile device ID, your mobile carrier, and your physical (GPS) location
may be transmitted to Chegg.  You agree that Chegg may store and use that
information for security purposes (for example, for user verification and to
ensure that Chegg's APIs are being used appropriately) and, if available,
for purposes of assisting you in locating nearby shipping stores, schools or
other places of interest. Chegg does not share your location information
with third parties except for a location service provider Google Maps.  If
you wish to no longer allow Chegg to track your physical locations you may
turn this off within your device settings. When you place an order through
the Services, you may be able to opt-in to receiving text messaging
reminders from Chegg. If you choose to do so, you must provide to Chegg your
telephone number, which Chegg will store and use to send reminders to you.
You may always opt-out by replying “STOP” to one of the text
messages received.  You also acknowledge and agree that use of the Services
through a mobile device may cause data to be displayed on and through your
mobile device which may be viewed by your mobile carrier or other access
provider.
</p>
<h2><a name="sharing">Information Sharing</a></h2>
<p>
Chegg does not share your Personal Information with third parties for their
marketing purposes without your consent.  Chegg may share non-Personal
Information, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic information and
Usage Information with third parties, and third parties, including third
party advertisers, content providers, and analytics providers, may collect
such information when you visit the Services. We also may share your
Personal Information with third parties with your consent, as disclosed at
the time you provide us with information, and as described below or
otherwise in this privacy policy: 
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Educational Institutions:</strong>
We work with colleges, universities, scholarship providers and educational
institutions (“Educational Institutions”) to provide targeted
recruiting and outreach to some of our members. For Services provided on
Zinch.com, we allow Educational Institutions to review your Full Profile
(such as hometown, grade point average, and graduation year), whether or not
you have chosen to restrict public access to some of that information. 
However, we do not share your contact information (email address, postal
address or phone number) with these Educational Institutions without your
consent, but we may send you information on their behalf.  This is a
fundamental element of our free Services on Zinch.com.  In addition, you may
indicate that you would like to receive additional information from
Educational Institutions or other third parties and we will then share your
information with those parties so that they may contact you per your
request.  We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of
third parties, and, if you later decide that you no longer want to receive
communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party
directly.
</li>
<li><strong>When You Request That We Share Your Information.</strong>
We may offer opportunities and features through the Services that are
brought to you by a third party or that otherwise involve sharing your
information with a third party.  If you request or agree at that time to
have your information shared, your information will be disclosed to that
third party (or parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and
practices of that third party. You also may request, sometimes through your
use of an interactive feature, a widget or third party application, that we
share information about you with a third party and we will typically do so
under those circumstances. </li>
<li><strong>Service Providers.</strong>
We will share your Personal Information with third parties to carry out your
instructions and to provide specific services to you or to us as part of our
Services, but subject to confidentiality obligations which limit their use
and disclosure of such information.  If you purchase any products or
services, our billing partner will receive billing and financial information
(e.g., credit card numbers) necessary to process your charges, including
your postal and e-mail addresses, depending on your payment method.
</li>
<p>
If you choose to use the Powered by Chegg® kiosk at a participating
Authorized Chegg Affiliate, the affiliate will be provided with your
personal information, including your contact information, the books you are
renting, and rental fees. These affiliates are permitted to use your
Personal Information only for purposes of processing the transaction and
providing the service.</p>
<li><strong>Administrative and Legal Reasons.</strong>
We may also disclose your information, including Personal Information,  in
response to a subpoena or when required by law; to defend our rights; in
response to a written request from law enforcement regarding an
investigation into criminal activity that may have occurred through or in
any way using Chegg’s Services or property; to provide information to
a claimed owner of intellectual property who claims that content you have
provided to us infringes on their rights; as part of an investigation into
academic integrity; to protect and/or defend any applicable Terms of Use or
other policies applicable to the Services; or to protect the personal
safety, rights, property or security of any organization or individual. We
may also use Device Identifiers, including IP addresses, to identify users,
and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service
providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies in our
discretion. These disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.
</li>
<li><strong>Business Transitions</strong>
Chegg may share Personal Information with its parent, subsidiaries and
affiliates, primarily for business and operational purposes.  In the event
that Chegg goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition
by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, or other
corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any
due diligence process, your information, including Personal Information,
will likely be among the assets transferred. This Privacy Policy will become
binding upon the new owner of the information until amended. </li>
<li><strong> Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions.</strong>
We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions ("Promotion") that
may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing
to governing terms, conditions or official rules, which may contain specific
requirements of you, including allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to
use your name, voice, likeness or other indicia of persona in advertising or
marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion,
Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in
connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, without
limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as
required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules, such as on a
winners list.
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="updating">UPDATING Your Account Information AND Control over
your profile</a></h2>
<p>
You may be able to review the information you provided to us on a Service
and make any desired changes to the information, or to the settings for your
account on that Service, by logging in to your account for that Service and
editing the information. You also may be able to limit the information you
receive from us by adjusting your settings.  For Zinch.com, we reserve the
right to send you information on our behalf and on behalf of third parties
in connection with our providing the Services and therefore, with regard to
Zinch.com, if you no longer want to receive information from us, you will
need to close your account for that Service.
</p>
<p>
Please note that the default setting in any Public Profile on a Service may
be that the information in your Public Profile is available to everyone on
the internet.  This is the case on Zinch.com, where the default setting is
for your Public Profile to be public.  You may be able to customize your
Public Profile and opt out of making certain information visible to the
public.  For Zinch.com, note that if you choose to remove certain
information from your Public Profile, such information will still be
available for viewing and use by Educational Institutions and Chegg.
</p>
<h2><a name="closing">Closing Your Account</a></h2>
<p>
If you wish to close your account with Zinch.com, please send your request
to <a href="mailto:help@zinch.com">help@zinch.com</a> and we will remove
your Personal Information and Public Profile, if applicable, from the active
databases.   If you wish to close your account on any of our other Services,
please send your request to <a href="mailto:legaldept@chegg.com">legaldept@chegg.com</a>.  Please send your
request using an email account that you have registered with Chegg under
your name. You will receive a response to a request sent to <a href="mailto:legaldept@chegg.com">legaldept@chegg.com</a> within five
business days of our receiving it.  Closing your account on one of our
Services does not necessarily mean you have closed your account on another
one of our Services, and therefore, you may continue to receive
communications from Chegg in relation to your membership on another Service.
</p>
<p>
Even if your account is closed, information may remain in backup records and
we may retain certain data if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future
abuse or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated,
non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery or if required by law.
All retained data will continue to be subject to the terms of the applicable
privacy policy for the Service.  Also, if you have posted content on or
through the Services, such as in Community Forums, we may not be able to
delete it.</p>
<h2><a name="thirdpartycontent">THIRD PARTY CONTENT, LINKS TO OTHER SITES,
AND CHEGG CONTENT FOUND OUTSIDE OF THE SITE</a></h2>
<p>
Certain content provided through the Services may be hosted and served by
third parties, which may include third party widgets (such as those that
allow you to “like” or “share” content with third
party web sites and online services.  In addition, the Services may link to
third party web sites or content over which Chegg has no control and which
are governed by the privacy policies and business practices of those third
parties. In addition, third-party partners of Chegg from whom your order
through the Services may have different privacy policies which apply to such
partner’s use of your information. 
</p>
<p>
Please also note that Chegg content and widgets may be included on web pages
and web sites that are not associated with us and over which we have no
control. These third parties may independently collect data.  Chegg is not
responsible for the privacy practices or business practices of any third
party.
</p>
<h2><a name="security">Security</a></h2>
<p>
Chegg takes commercially reasonable security measures to protect the
personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we
receive it. For example, when you enter sensitive information such as a
geolocation data, credit card number and CCV2 number on our checkout forms,
that information is encrypted using secure socket layer (SSL) technology, to
help protect the communications between you and our payment partners.
</p>
<p>
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use
commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, as in
any real-life scenario, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p>
<h2><a name="consent">CONSENT TO TRANSFER</a></h2>
<p>
The Services are operated in the United States. If you are located outside
of the United States, please be aware that information we collect will be
transferred to and processed in the United States. By using the Services, or
providing us with any information, you fully understand and unambiguously
consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the
United States, a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may not be as
comprehensive as those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.
</p>
<h2><a name="changes">CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</a></h2>
<p>
Chegg may update this Privacy Policy at any time and any changes will be
effective upon posting so please review it frequently. In the event that
there are material changes to the way we treat your Personal Information, we
will display a notice on the Sites or through the Services. We may also
notify you by email. However, we will use your Personal Information in a
manner consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time you
submitted the information, unless you consent to the new or revised policy.
</p>
