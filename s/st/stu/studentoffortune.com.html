<h2 class="mainboxHeader">Gathering, Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<div class="mainbox">
<p>We collect both Non-Personally-Identifying Information and Personally-Identifying Information from you.  <b>"Non–Personally–Identifying Information"</b> is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity.  "Personally–Identifying Information," by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person or entity.</p>
<p><b>A.	Gathering Non-Personally-Identifying Information</b></p>
		<p><b>(i)	Web Browsers</b></p>
<p>Like most site operators, we gather Non-Personally-Identifying Information from you of the sort that web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available.  That information includes your Internet Protocol (<b>"IP"</b>) address, operating system and browser type, and the locations of the web pages you view right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving this Site.</p>
<p><b>(ii)	Web Cookies</b></p>
<p>A <b>"Web Cookie"</b> is a string of information that a site stores on a your computer.  Your browser provides this string of information to us each time you submit a query to this Site.  We use Web Cookies to track the pages that you visit each time you visit this Site, both to help us improve your experience and to help us understand how this Site is being used.  </p>
<p>IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSER TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THIS SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THIS SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE WEB COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY. </p>
<p><b>(iii)	Third Parties’ Use of Web Beacons and Web Cookies</b></p>
<p>This Site may include third-party advertising, links to other sites, and other content from third party businesses. The content posted by these parties will be reasonably identifiable as coming from a third party. These third-party sites, businesses, and advertisers, or advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and Web Cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, personalize or optimize advertising content and to track users who link from their respective sites to this Site, but this third party technology does not permit them to access your Personal Information. </p>
<p>We do not have access to or control over web beacons or Web Cookies that these third parties may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites or businesses are not covered by this Privacy Policy but are covered by their respective privacy policies as is described in more detail in Section 5 below. </p>
<p>Some third party advertising companies may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology. For more information about these partners and links to their privacy policies, please view each third party’s site.</p>
	<p><b>B.	Use of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</b></p>

<p>We analyze Non–Personally–Identifying Information gathered from users of this Site to help us better understand how this Site is being used.  By identifying patterns and trends in usage, we are able to better design this Site to improve your experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use.  We may also link information gathered using Web Cookies to Personally-Identifying Information for safety and security reasons and for the purpose of improving the content and your experience on this Site.  </p>

</div>

<h2 class="mainboxHeader">Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personally–Identifying Information</h2>
<div class="mainbox">
<p>As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity.

<p>By submitting a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (<b>"DMCA"</b>) Infringement Notification or other communication (including notices of violations of Site Terms of Use and other communications directed to us) you consent to have this communication forwarded to the person or entity who stored or transmitted the content addressed by your communications in order to facilitate a prompt resolution.  For notices other than DMCA Infringement Notifications, upon request, we will edit out your name and contact information.

You will not be required to participate in any promotion.  </p>

<p><b>H.	Security</b></p>

<p>We take reasonable precautions to protect the security of your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof.  Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your Personally-Identifying Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<p><b>I.	Other Disclosures</b></p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision in this Privacy Policy, we will disclose Personally-Identifying Information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
		<p><b> (i)	Employees and Third Party Processors </b></p>

<p>We disclose Personally–Identifying Information if:  (1) required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena or court order; (2) we believe in our sole discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect against fraud, to protect our property or other rights, or the rights of other users, third parties or the public at large; or (3) we believe that you have abused the service by using it to attack other systems or to gain unauthorized access to any other system, to engage in spamming or otherwise to violate applicable laws.</p>
		<p><b> (iii)	Business Transfers; Bankruptcy</b></p>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer all Personally-Identifying Information in our possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of our assets.  Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred Personally–Identifying Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if you are given notice of that new privacy policy and you affirmatively opt-in to accept it.  Personally-Identifying Information submitted or collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor organization.</p>  

		<p><b>(iv)	Marketing</b></p>
<p>We may email you about products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.  We may also will provide your email information to third parties, so that those third parties may directly contact you about additional products and services.</p>

<h2 class="mainboxHeader">Collection and Use of Information by Third Parties Not Covered By this Agreement</h2>
<div class="mainbox">
<p>Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy with respect to Personally-Identifying Information that you provide directly to those third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves such as via links.  We do not control the third-party sites that may be accessible through this Site.  Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to third party sites or gathered by the third parties that operate them.  Before visiting a third party site, whether by means of a link on this Site or otherwise, and before providing any Personally-Identifying Information to any third party, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that site, and you should take those steps necessary, in your discretion, to protect your privacy.</p>  
</div>

<h2 class="mainboxHeader">Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<div class="mainbox">
<p>Because of changes in technology and the growth and development of our business or for other business reasons, we may need to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time.  We will alert you by email if this policy is revised (if you have given us your email address) and will post a copy of the new policy with its effective date on this Site.  It is therefore important that you register with the site and notify us if you change email addresses.  If you do not provide us with a current email address, you should regularly review this policy to ensure that you are informed of any changes. </p>
