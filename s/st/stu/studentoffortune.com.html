<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Our primary purpose in collecting and storing information is to provide our users with secure, pleasant, and efficient service. Student of Fortune is the sole owner of the information collected on StudentofFortune.com. </p>
<p>We collect, store, and use personally identifiable information to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide the services and customer support you request</li>
  <li>Prevent fraudulent and illegal activities</li>
  <li>Enforce our Terms of Use</li>
  <li>Personalize and improve our site's content and layout</li>
  <li>Offer specific questions and solutions that may interest you</li>
</ul>
<p>We collect, store, and use aggregate (not personally identifiable) information to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Offer targeted marketing to our advertisers</li>
  <li>Perform troubleshooting and routine diagnostics</li>
  <li>Improve our services and offerings</li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2>How We Collect Information</h2>
<p><b>Registration</b></p>
<p>In order to use most functions of our website, you must first complete the registration form and create a user name and password. During registration, you are required to give valid contact information (such as your name and email address). We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. </p>
<p>You have the option to provide demographic information (such as educational level and gender) to us. We encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site. </p>
<p>We offer you the opportunity to opt-in and opt-out of various email communications from Student of Fortune, such as a newsletter and service notifications. See <b>Communications from the Site</b> below for additional details.</p>
<p><b>Financial Transactions</b></p>
<p>We collect personally identifiable information each time that perform a transaction that would cause money to be added or deducted from your Student of Fortune account. This information includes (but is not limited to) your Student Of Fortune account number, IP address, question/solution numbers, third-party transaction identification numbers, transaction values, and other personally identifiable information. We use this information to administer financial transactions and to reduce the risk of fraud.</p>
<p><b>Surveys or Contests</b></p>
<p>From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). </p>
<p>We may use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests. We will prohibit this third-party service provider from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose.</p>
<p><b>Tell-A-Friend</b></p>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. This email contains a link back to our website that contains your Student of Fortune account name. This will track which users register on our site though our referral so that we may offer you participation in our various referral programs. Student of Fortune does not store this information and uses it for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. </p>
<p><b>Browser Activities</b></p>
<p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in web server log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and click-stream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. </p>
<h2>Communications from the Site</h2>
<p><b>Newsletters</b></p>
<p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the <a href="#choice">"Choice and Opt-out"</a> section.</p>
<p><b>Solutions</b></p>
<p>You will receive copies of the solutions that you purchase from the site via email. You will also be notified when other users offer solutions to your questions. You may opt-out of receiving either or both of these notifications. Please see the <a href="#choice">"Choice and Opt-out"</a> section.</p>
<p><b>Questions</b></p>
<p>You may subscribe to a service that will email you summaries of questions that you may be interested in answering. You may control the frequency of these emails or opt-out entirely. Please see the <a href="#choice">"Choice and Opt-out"</a> section.</p>
<p><b>Service-Related Announcements</b></p>
<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, we may send you an email if we suspend our service for maintenance or if we make material changes to our policies.</p>
<p>Because these messages are important and not promotional in nature, you may not opt-out of these communications. If you do not wish to receive them, you may deactivate your account.</p>
<p><b>Customer Service</b></p>
<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. </p>
<p><b>Profile</b></p>
<p>We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, and/or clear gifs to create a "profile" of your preferences. We tie your personally identifiable information and purchasing history to information in the profile in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers, improve the content of the site, and to reduce the risk of fraud. </p>
<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<p><b>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</b></p>
<p>We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers. This information does not identify individual users. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information. </p>
<p><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b></p>
<p>We do not share personally identifiable information with third parties except as described below.</p>

<p><em>Legal Requirements</em></p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website. We also reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information to take legal action related to breaches of our Terms of Use.</p>
<h2><a name="choice">Choice and Opt-out</a></h2>
<p>We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. </p>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication. We offer an opportunity to opt-out of certain communications on our User Account page. </p>
<p>You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not one of our agents or service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.</p>
