<p>During registration for the Services,
you may be required to give contact information such as first and last name,
email address, school (if applicable), city, state and gender, as well as a
protected password. We ask that you provide demographic information (such as
your school, school year and gender) to us so we can provide you with a more
personalized experience on our Web sites and to comply with state sales tax laws
that may provide sales tax relief on certain transactions depending on the
nature of the transaction, your grade and the type of school you attend. Once
you become a user, you may provide additional information in the Profile
section describing your contact information, student information and billing
and shipping address changes. Providing additional information in your Profile
beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional.</p>
<p>We use the information you provide upon
registering and in your Profile to send you an informational email with
confirmation details and other information. Chegg also may provide you with
notice of Website updates from time to time and responses to any inquiries or
problems of which you have notified us.</p>
<p>Many emails you initiate through the
Services will list your email address and name in the header of the message.
Other communications that you initiate through the Websites, like a request for

store and use that information for security purposes (for example, for user
verification and to ensure that Chegg’s APIs are being used appropriately) and,
if available, for purposes of assisting you in locating nearby shipping stores,
schools or other places of interest. If you wish to no longer allow Chegg to
track your physical locations you may turn this off within your device
settings. When you place an order through the Services, you may be able to
opt-in to receiving text messaging reminders from Chegg. If you choose to do
so, you must provide to Chegg your telephone number which Chegg will store and
use to send reminders to you. You also acknowledge and agree that use of the
Services through a mobile device may cause data to be displayed on and through
your mobile device which may be viewed by your mobile carrier or other access
provider.</p>  
<p>To opt-out from receiving text messages
you may login to your account and select off, you will no longer receive

logged into Facebook, when you click on “Connect with Facebook” you will be
prompted to enter your Facebook credentials or to “Sign up for Facebook.” By
proceeding, you are allowing the Chegg application to access your information
to provide a personalized experience on the Websites, and you are agreeing to
the Facebook Terms of Use in your use of the Chegg application. There is no
merging of profiles from the Chegg mobile application.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you are not currently
registered as a Chegg user and you click on “Sign in Using Facebook,” you will
first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option
to register and join Chegg. Once you register on the Chegg sites and Connect
with Facebook, you will be able to post recent activity back to Facebook. You
have the option to disable Facebook Connect at any time by logging into “My

<div class="pboxtr"></div>
</div>
<div class="pboxcnt">
<div class="pboxcntnr">
<p>Like most websites, Chegg uses cookies
and Web log files to track usage of our Websites. A cookie is a tiny data file
which resides on your computer, and which allows Chegg to recognize you as a
user when you return to our Websites using the same computer and Web browser.
Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be
able to use our Websites as fully as intended. Like the information you enter
at registration or in your profile, cookie and log file data is used to
customize your experience on the Websites.</p>
<p>
One type of cookie we use, known as a
“persistent” cookie, is set once you’ve logged in to your Chegg account on the
Services. If you do not log out of your Chegg account, then the next time you
visit the Websites, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an
existing user so you will not need to log in before using the Service. Of
course, if you are using a public computer or sharing your private computer
with others, you should log out of your Chegg account after each visit. If you
log out of the Services, you will need to re-enter your password the next time
you visit in order to log in to your account. We also use a cookie which
functions as a “session” cookie, meaning that it is used to identify a
particular visit to the Websites. Session cookies expire after a short time or
when you close your Web browser.
</p>
<p>
Chegg works with third parties that
collect non-personally identifiable information by placing cookies on its
visitor’s browsers. The information collected by such third parties may be used
for targeting more relevant advertisements to such visitors on other sites. If
you do not wish to have such cookies on your browser, Chegg works with Truste
which gives you the ability to opt out of some or all tailored advertising
networks here . &gt;<a href="http://preferences.truste.com/truste/"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:blue">http://preferences.truste.com/truste/</span></a></p>
<p>
Due to the communications standards on
the Internet, when you visit the Websites we automatically receive the URL of
the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave
Chegg. We also receive the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer (or
the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating
system and type of Web browser you are using, as well as the name of your
Internet service provider (ISP). This information is used to analyze overall
trends to help us improve the Services. The linkage between your IP address and
your personally identifiable information is never shared with third parties
without your permission, except as provided under Legal Disclosures and
Business Transitions below.

<p>We, as well as our affiliate program
partners, third-party tracking utility companies, and service providers employ
a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web beacons/Web bugs), that
help us better manage content on our site by informing us of what content is
effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in
function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users
for our affiliate program. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s
computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are
about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the
information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable
information. This information is used to help improve the overall quality and

<div class="pboxcntnr">
<p>We allow other companies, called ad
networks, to serve advertisements to users who visit our website. Ad networks include
third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.
Chegg may serve tailored advertising to users who are interested in products we
sell or fit a certain individual profile for example, "engineering
students at Stanford University." We may share a customer’s
personally-identifiable information, including name, address, email address, as
well as a record of any transactions conducted on our website or offline with
us with a third-party advertising partner and its service providers to deliver
banner advertisements and other advertising tailored to a user’s interests when
they visit certain websites. We will provide that information to ad networks
indirectly through a third party vendor that anonymizes customers’ personally-identifiable
information before making it available to the rest of the ad network, and on
terms that do not permit further dissemination of that information or use of
that information for any other purpose beyond the delivery of the ad service.</p>
<p>
To deliver these ads properly, Chegg may
include a file, called a Web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served
by Chegg so the networks may provide anonymous, aggregated auditing, research
and reporting for advertisers, as well as to target ads to you while you visit
other websites.
</p>
<p>
Because your Web browser must request
these advertisements and Web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these
companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested
a Web page from their site. These general targets may also be used by ad
networks to display targeted ads on other websites as a substitute for random,
irrelevant ads. You will never see additional ads when browsing the web as a
result of being a Chegg user. To learn more about the use of this information
or choose not to have this information used by our third-party advertising
partner by opting out please visit the Truste website here. <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/truste/"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;

<p>Chegg follows accepted industry
standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
transmission and once we receive it. For example, when you enter sensitive
information such as a credit card number and CCV2 number on our checkout forms,
that information is encrypted using secure socket layer (SSL) technology, to
protect the communications between you and our payment partners. We take
reasonable precautions to provide security to our customer information in our
possession.</p>
<p>However, no method of transmission over
the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while
we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal
information, as in any real-life scenario, we cannot guarantee its absolute
security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can
