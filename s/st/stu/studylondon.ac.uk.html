<p><strong>3. Our Legal Basis for processing data</strong></p>
<p>3.1 Organisations that collect and use personal data must have a lawful basis for doing so under data protection law and we are required to let you know the lawful basis on which we rely to process your personal data. We rely upon the following lawful bases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your consent to use your data for a particular purpose (for example to send you direct marketing by e-mail or to collect sensitive personal data);</li>
<li>Where the use of the data is in our “legitimate interests” (see below for more information);</li>
<li>Where we need to process your data in order to perform our obligations under a contract that we have entered into with you (for example to enrol you in an event or provide you with access to resources); and</li>
<li>To process data where we are under a legal obligation to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.2 Personal data may be legally collected and used if it is necessary for a legitimate interest of the organisation using the data, as long as its use is fair and does not adversely impact the rights of the individual concerned. When we use your personal information, we will always consider if it is fair and balanced to do so and if it is within your reasonable expectations. We will balance your rights and our legitimate interests to ensure that we use your personal information in ways that are not unduly intrusive or unfair. Our legitimate interests include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promotion of our purposes, including to develop new offers and services (both independently and with our partners) to promote London to visitors, students and businesses;</li>
<li>Administration and operational management, including responding to solicited enquires, providing information that you have requested, research, events management, the administration of our resources and tools.</li>
<li>Liaising with third parties, including working with partner organisations to develop new programmes and resources which further our purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.3 If you would like more information on our uses of legitimate interests or to change our use of your personal data in this manner, please get in touch with us using the details in the “Contact us” section below.</p>
<p><strong>4. Will we share your information with others?</strong></p>
<p>4.1 We may share your personal information with any member of our group, which includes our group companies both in the UK and outside the UK.</p>
<p>4.2 We may share your information with selected third parties including:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you;</li>
<li>we may (with your consent, where appropriate) pass your details onto third parties including our partners to provide you with information and offers which may be of interest to you;</li>
<li>advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others. We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in south London). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience; and</li>
<li>analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our platforms.</li>
</ol>
<p>4.3 We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>in the event that we transfer, sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; and/or</li>
<li>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or our safety and/or, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
</ol>
<p>4.4 We may allow our staff, consultants and/or external providers (data processors) acting on our behalf to access and use your information for the purposes for which you have provided to us (e.g. to analyse data and to process payments). We only provide them with the information they need to deliver the relevant service, and ensure that we take steps to ensure that they process personal data in a secure manner.</p>
<p><strong>5. How do we protect the security of personal data?</strong></p>
<p>5.1 We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.</p>
<p>5.2 While we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard your personal data, you acknowledge that the use of the internet is not entirely secure and for this reason we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any personal data that are transferred via the internet. If you have any particular concerns about your information, please contact us.</p>
<p>6. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<p>6.1 The information we collect from you may be transferred to and processed and/or stored at a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). If we send your personal data outside the EEA we will take reasonable steps to ensure that the recipient implements appropriate measures to protect your information.</p>
<p><strong>7. How long do we keep your data for?</strong></p>
<p>7.1 We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>7.2 In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you. Once you no longer have a relationship with us, we will retain and securely destroy your personal information in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>7.3 If you request to receive no further contact from us, we will keep some basic information about you on our suppression list in order to avoid sending you unwanted materials in the future.</p>
