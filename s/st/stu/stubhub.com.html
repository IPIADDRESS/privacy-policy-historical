As indicated herein, information collected on co-branded pages hosted by StubHub is collected by co-branded partners. The contact information and transaction data (excluding credit card numbers) provided by customers on our co-branded sites and registered or transacted through the partner's co-branded 'StubHub' are essentially shared by StubHub and the owner of that co-branded website.

	<p>
	<strong>Profile</strong></p>
	<p>We store information that we collect through cookies and log files to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our website, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them.  This information may also be used to help improve our services overall.  We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
	</p>
	<p><em>Cookies:</em><br>
	A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information while a user is visiting our site. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For the session cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site. By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still browse our site, however they will not be able to buy or sell tickets. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.</p>
	
	<p>StubHub is currently using and has contracted with Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical
	information from our visitors and customers. We use the information to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To
	do this, we use web beacons and cookies provided by Omniture on this site. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what
	pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. StubHub owns
	this data and controls how it may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy,
	you can "opt-out" of this website analysis tool by clicking here <a href="http://www.omniture.com/privacy#optout">http://www.omniture.com/privacy#optout</a>.</p>

	<p><em>Log Files:</em><br>
	Like most standard website servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring pages, platform type, date/time stamp. IP addresses, etc. are linked to personally identifiable information. We use Log Files in error diagnostics, session management and determining our advertising efficacy.</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Communications from the Site</strong></p>
	<p><em>Transactions and Service Announcements:</em> <br>
    Members who buy or sell tickets will receive a  number of emails throughout the transaction process and they may sometimes  receive phone calls from our Customer Service department to ensure smooth  transactions. We may also occasionally send out service-related announcements,  for instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance.  Generally, these communications are not promotional in nature, and users will  receive them as long as their accounts are open.</p>
	<p><em>Special Offers, Newsletters and Updates:</em>
	  <br>
    Out of respect for the privacy of our users we  present the option to not receive these types of communications, as explained  in the <em>Choice and opt-out</em> section  below.</p>

	<p>
	<strong>Sharing Information</strong></p>
	<p>At StubHub, we care about your privacy. We will not share your credit card number or any other financial information with any third party except for the verification purposes mentioned above. We may share your personal information with third parties in the following instances:</p>
	<p><em>Within Our Corporate Family:<br clear="all">
    </em>We may share information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint  ventures or other companies under common control, where it may be used to  provide joint services or for purposes such as internal statistics, strategic  decision-making, customer verification, fraud prevention and security. </p>
	<p><em>Legal Disclaimer:  </em><br>
    Though we make every effort to preserve user  privacy, we may disclose personal information when required by law or under the  good-faith belief that such action is necessary under applicable law. We may  disclose personal information in order to establish or exercise our legal  rights or defend against legal claims. We also share information in order to  investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected  fraud, to protect our property or interests or that of our agents and employees,  and to protect personal safety or the public.</p>
	
	<p><em>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable): </em><br>
	We share some aggregated demographic information (age, zip codes) with some of our partners. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information. We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. </p>

	<p><em>Co-Branded Partners:  </em><br>
	The contact information and transaction data (excluding credit card numbers) provided by customers on our co-branded sites and registered or transacted through a partner's co-branded StubHub are essentially shared with the owner of that co-branded website. Your choices about being contacted are included with that information so that partner can respect your preferences. Refer to that website's privacy policy for information on how they will handle your information. </p>
	
	<p><em>Third Party Service Providers:  </em><br>
	We may disclose information about individual users to third parties who provide services to StubHub.  These third parties provide a variety of  services to StubHub, including, without limitation, verifying credit card  information, fulfilling ticket orders via courier delivery, processing credit  card transactions, and disbursing payments to sellers. In addition, these services may include enhancing the information StubHub collects about its customers. We may also use third-party email providers to assist with sending our marketing emails. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.  Any personally identifiable information that StubHub shares with its service providers may only be used to provide services to StubHub and the service providers will not be given permission to use such information for other purposes.</p>
	
	<p><em>Business Transitions:  </em><br>
	In the event StubHub goes through a business transition, such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via prominent notice on our website for 30 days after a change of ownership or control of their personal information, if personal information will be used contrary to this policy. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, users will be given the option to continue sharing their information consistent with our notification of changes section.  However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of StubHub to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets (including the Site), for any purposes, without any limitation whatsoever.  StubHub specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of personally identifiable information collected from its Site to the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information. </p>
	<p>
	<strong>Security</strong> </p>
	<p>This website takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online and off-line. </p>
	
	<p>When our registration/order form asks users to  enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is  encrypted and is protected with encryption software, currently SSL encryption.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web  browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes  locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. While  we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect  user-information off-line. Access to all users' information, not just the  sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted to our offices. Only  employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our  billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to  personally identifiable information. Employees are kept up-to-date on our  security and privacy practices. The servers that store personally identifiable  information are in a secure environment, behind a locked cage at a professional  hosting company. Although we endeavor to create secure and reliable Sites and  to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure  you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be  disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. You hereby  acknowledge that StubHub is not responsible for any intercepted information  sent via the Internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims  arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any  unauthorized manner.</p>
	<p>
	<strong>External Links</strong></p>
	<p>The Site contains links to other websites  maintained by third parties. Please be aware that StubHub exercises no control  over linked sites and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the  content of such sites. Each linked site maintains its own independent privacy  and data collection policies and procedures, and you are encouraged to view the  privacy policies of these other sites before providing any personal  information.</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Changes in this Privacy Statement</strong> </p>

	<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post  those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem  appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it,  and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at  any time, so please review it frequently.&nbsp;  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by  email, or by means of a notice on our home page. </p>
