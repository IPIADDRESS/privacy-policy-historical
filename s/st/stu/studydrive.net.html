    <div class="headline">3.2.2   	Cookies and similar technologies</div>
    <div class="text">The platform uses cookies and similar technologies. Cookies and similar technologies help make the Studydrive website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure.
        <br><br>Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user’s computer and saved by the browser. Most of the cookies the platform uses are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after a user’s visit. Other cookies remain in the device's memory until users delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize the user’s browser when the user next visits the site.
        <br><br>A similar technology is used for the Studydrive app, so called Cell-IDs. These allow Studydrive to identify the user’s mobile device, for example when a user opens the app again after the first use. One example: In the Firebase (see above) SDK-library an App Instance ID is used to identify app installations. In general, within the Firebase SDK, IDs of mobile device are identified by a technology that is similar to cookies.
        <br><br>Users can configure their browser to inform them about the use of cookies so that they can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, the user’s browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing the browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.
        <br><br>Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions users wish to use are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy policy.

    <div class="text">Studydrive uses the services of Mailgun to send emails. This service is provided by Mailgun Technologies, 535 Mission St., 14th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA.
        <br><br>Mailgun is a service which organizes and analyzes the distribution of newsletters. In order to send personalized emails and newsletter to users, personal data like users’ names and email address will be stored on Mailgun servers in the USA.
        <br><br>Mailgun is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is an agreement between the European Union (EU) and the US to ensure compliance with European privacy standards in the United States.
        <br><br>Studydrive uses Mailgun to analyze newsletter and email campaigns. When users open an email sent by Mailgun, a file included in the email (called a web beacon) connects to Mailgun's servers in the United States. This allows Studydrive to determine if an email message has been opened and which links users click on. In addition, technical information is collected (e.g. time of retrieval, IP address, browser type, and operating system). This information cannot be assigned to a specific recipient. It is used exclusively for the statistical analysis of our newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better tailor future newsletters and emails to users’ interests.
        <br><br>If users do not want their usage of newsletters to be analyzed by Mailgun, users will have to unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a link in every newsletter we send. Users can also unsubscribe from the newsletter directly on the website in their settings.
        <br><br>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO for emails which are linked to the execution of the usage contract, and is based on Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO for Newsletters, which users subscribed to via opt-in.
        <br><br>Users may revoke their consent to newsletters at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter or email campaigns. More information on how to unsubscribe from newsletter and email campaigns are detailed in paragraph 4.1.1 of this privacy policy. The data processed before Studydrive receives a user’s request may still be legally processed.
        <br><br>The data provided when registering for a newsletter will be used to distribute mails until users cancel their subscription when said data will be deleted from our servers and those of Mailgun. Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remains unaffected.
