We came into this project quite cautiously after having our fingers burnt on a previous website project. Studiowide put our minds to rest and have created a great website which we are proud of. Also, the after sales support they have given us in the early stages of going live is second to none. We would highly recommend these guys to anyone!</div></div></div></div><div class="item no-pic"><div class="item-inner"><div class="name-qo block-2 no-mar"><div class="block-inner"><div class="name-qo-inner"><div class="name"><div class="name-name"><a href="http://www.studiowide.co.uk/testimonials/home-build-help/">Home Build Help</a></div><div class="name-desc">Colin Kimmins, Managing Director</div></div><div class="qo"></div></div></div></div><div class="text"><div class="block-inner">The whiteboard animation makes me smile every time I see it.

Thank you very much for all your hard work, dedication and creativity throughout the whole website design and video production process. The team have always been very welcoming and understood the message I am trying to portray. I am really excited and looking forward to the future successes of Home Build Help, which is largely down to your ability and vision.</div></div></div></div><div class="item no-pic"><div class="item-inner"><div class="name-qo block-2 no-mar"><div class="block-inner"><div class="name-qo-inner"><div class="name"><div class="name-name"><a href="http://www.studiowide.co.uk/testimonials/grim-reaper-foods/">Grim Reaper Foods</a></div><div class="name-desc">Russell Williams, Managing Director</div></div><div class="qo"></div></div></div></div><div class="text"><div class="block-inner">For a company to understand a client’s idea and bring it to life, for me, is amazing.

Quality was imperative and the project was far from straightforward. Studiowide had to assemble all products and set the various different background props in situ. Then finally edit in Photoshop. We selected Studiowide as we had confidence in their ability. All in all we were very pleased with the final work. As a result, I would highly recommend Studiowide and we will be using their services again in future.</div></div></div></div><div class="item no-pic"><div class="item-inner"><div class="name-qo block-2 no-mar"><div class="block-inner"><div class="name-qo-inner"><div class="name"><div class="name-name"><a href="http://www.studiowide.co.uk/testimonials/hr-integrated-solutions/">HR Integrated Solutions</a></div><div class="name-desc">Heather Hayes, Director</div></div><div class="qo"></div></div></div></div><div class="text"><div class="block-inner">Having very limited experience in the area of marketing or branding, Carl was extremely patient with us; talking us through the process but still allowing our own ideas to take fruition! Carl and his team have the patience of saints; for as the ideas became visuals we changed our minds and wanted different aspects. This happened on a number of occasions! All our demands were undertaken by the Studiowide team without complaint; they understood and wanted the best for us, their client. Communication was excellent, and we were kept informed and up to date on progress. Thank you Carl and all the team at Studiowide.</div></div></div></div><div class="item no-pic"><div class="item-inner"><div class="name-qo block-2 no-mar"><div class="block-inner"><div class="name-qo-inner"><div class="name"><div class="name-name"><a href="http://www.studiowide.co.uk/testimonials/justone-recruitment/">JustOne Recruitment</a></div><div class="name-desc">Greg Price, Business Development Manager</div></div><div class="qo"></div></div></div></div><div class="text"><div class="block-inner">Really pleased with the work carried out by Studiowide.
