<div class="std"><p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Stubbs &amp; Wootton protects your online order and registration information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than Stubbs &amp; Wootton. The secure mode begins when you initiate your order. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. You can double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser when accessing a secure service. The first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https". Some versions of the browsers and some firewalls don’t permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you’ll be unable to connect to the server so you won’t have to worry about mistakenly placing an order through an unsecured connection. However, please feel free to place your order with us by phone at 1 (877) 478-8227. Our customer service representatives will be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Privacy</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>We respect your privacy and, therefore, Stubbs &amp; Wootton does not sell or rent the personal information you provide to us to any third party. We will not share your personal information with any unaffiliated third party without your consent.&nbsp;<br> <br> Stubbs &amp; Wootton may, from time to time, contract with unaffiliated third parties that assist us in providing our products and services to you; assist in maintaining and managing customer information to provide customer and internet services; to take and fulfill orders; to conduct Stubbs &amp; Wootton promotions and surveys; or to more effectively communicate with our customers. These companies are contractually-restricted from using your information in any manner, other than in helping us to provide you with the products and services available on our site. Stubbs &amp; Wootton does not authorize any unaffiliated third party to make any other use of your information.&nbsp;<br> <br> We will add you to our mailing list when you supply us with your address. If you do not wish to receive our catalog, please contact us via email, phone, fax or mail. Include your name and address as it was supplied to us, and indicate "Do Not Mail".&nbsp;<br> <br> Sometimes we make our mailing list available to carefully screened companies whose products and services might interest you. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please contact us via email, phone, fax or mail. Include your name and address as it was supplied to us, and indicate "Do Not Share". Additionally we may disclose your personal information as a result of the sale of the stock of all or substantially all of the assets of Stubbs &amp; Wootton, whether by merger, acquisition, or similar or related transactions or in the event of a liquidation of the assets of the company.<br> <br> If you have chosen not to receive email or postal mailings from Stubbs &amp; Wootton prior to your participation in a contest, sweepstakes, promotion or survey, you may still receive information from Stubbs &amp; Wootton in connection with such activity if you register for or participate in it. You may also choose not to participate in contests, sweepstakes, promotions or surveys if you do not wish to receive information about Stubbs &amp; Wootton or share your information with Stubbs &amp; Wootton and the other companies sponsoring such activities at any time by contacting us by either email, phone or post mail.<br> <br> If you reach StubbsandWootton.com from a link on another website or search engine, information about your visit to StubbsandWootton.com may be collected by the provider of the referring website. You are encouraged to review the Privacy &amp; Security Statement of these other websites (or search engines).

<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2005, under California law, if you are a resident of California, you may make a written request to Stubbs &amp; Wootton about how we have shared your personal customer information with select third parties for their direct marketing purposes. In response to your written request, Stubbs &amp; Wootton will identify the categories of information shared and will include a list of the third parties and affiliates with which it was shared, along with their names and address. Please submit a written request to the following address: Customer Service, 502 Palm Street Unit 7 West Palm Beach, 33401. Please allow thirty (30) days for a response.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>We use "cookies" to enhance your experience with our site. Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to our site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. But to take full advantage of the www.StubbsandWootton.com experience, we recommend that you leave them turned on. However, if you would still like to place an order, simply call us at 1 (877) 478-8227 to place your order by phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a subscriber is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our files. Please note: we may nevertheless maintain a record of that person's name and address in a "do not register" file to avoid subsequent registration by a child under the age of 13.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
