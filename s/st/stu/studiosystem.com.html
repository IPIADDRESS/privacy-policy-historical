						<h1>Studio System™ Privacy Policy</h1>
						<p>
							Baseline, LLC. (dba BaselineFT, Baseline/FilmTracker, baseline.filmtracker.com,
							filmtracker.com and baseline.hollywood.com, Studio Systems, Inc., Baseline
							StudioSystems, Inc. and Baseline, Inc.) (“Baseline”) has created
							this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.
							The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices
							for this website, The Studio System: In the event of a conflict between these
							Terms and any written agreement between Baseline and you, the terms of that
							written agreement shall govern.
						</p>
						<h3>Baseline</h3>
						<p>
							We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to
							administer our website and services. Through customer surveys, subscriptions,
							and newsletter registration, our site may request users to give us contact
							information. The demographic information is used, among other things, to enhance
							user experience so we can be more content specific. The contact information is
							used to notify users of new services and content, as well as for surveys and
							newsletters. Our site uses a contract for customers to subscribe to our for-pay
							services. We may collect contact information and financial information. Contact
							information from customer contracts is used to send billing invoices. Contact
							information is also used to get in touch with the subscribers when necessary.
							Users may opt-out of receiving future communications; see the choice/opt-out
							section below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user
							for products and services. We will never share personal financial information
							with any other parties. Information collected during Baseline subscriber
							registration is used for in-house statistics, marketing target information, and
							advising clients of Baseline news and information. This site contains links to
							other sites. Baseline is not responsible for the privacy practices or the
							content of such websites.
						</p>
						<p>
							Baseline is committed to protecting your privacy online. Please read this privacy
							policy to fully understand how we will make use of the personal information you
							share with us. Baseline collects certain personal information in order to
							provide you with customized services, content, and advertisements. Some personal
							information is gathered when you register to receive certain Baseline products
							or services. We may disclose to third parties certain aggregate information
							contained in your registration data or related data, provided that, such
							information will NOT include personally indentifying information, except as
							specifically authorized by you or in the good faith belief that such action is
							reasonably necessary to comply with the law, legal process, or to enforce the
							terms of service. Baseline will also use your personal information for the
							purposes of providing you with any services to which you subscribe, and any
							service-related activities such as collecting subscription fees from you for
							those services, and notifying you or contacting you regarding any problem with,
							or the expiration of, such services. In this regard, it may be necessary for
							Baseline to disclose your personal information to one or more agents and
							contractors of Baseline and their subcontractors, but such agents, contractors,
							and subcontractors will be required to agree to use the information obtained
							from Baseline only for these purposes. Do not divulge your password to anyone.
							Baseline will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in
							an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your Baseline account and
							close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure
							that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you
							share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place
							like a library or Internet cafe. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the
							Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a
							result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Baseline cannot
							ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our
							online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive
							your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our
							systems. Baseline reserves the right to change this statement at any time by
							posting revisions on the Baseline web site. This privacy policy is not intended
							to, and does not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of
							any party.
						</p>
						<p>
							Through surveys and newsletter registration, our site may request users to give
							us contact, demographic, and/or financial information. The demographic
							information is used to enhance user experience so we can be more content
							specific. The contact information is used to notify users of new content, for
							surveys and newsletters, via email. Financial information that is collected is
							used primarily for in-house statistics, advertising, and marketing target
							information. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the
							choice/opt-out section below.
						</p>
						<p>
							We may run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information
							and demographic information. The user’s contact information is used to
							contact the visitor when necessary, such as if they win a contest or to notify
							users of upcoming contests. There are three primary types of contests:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>We host solely and all information that is collected stays in-house.</li>
							<li>
								We may share address information with third party for shipping purposes.
							</li>
							<li>
								In some rare instances, a third party may host the contest and all
								information is then shared. In our contest registration, we give our users
								the opportunity to sign up for the Baseline newsletter. However, users may
								opt-out of receiving future mailings by selecting the “unsubscribe”
								link at the bottom of the newsletter.
							</li>
						</ol>
