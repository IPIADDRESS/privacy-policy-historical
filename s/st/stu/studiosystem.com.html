					<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
					<p>
						<b>Last Revised:</b> September 14, 2018
					</p><p>
						Gracenote, a Nielsen Company (“<b>Gracenote</b>,” “<b>we</b>,” or “<b>us</b>”), is committed to protecting
						your privacy and handling your information in an open and transparent manner. This
						Privacy Statement explains how we use, share, and protect the information we gather about
						you via studiosystem.com and any other website where this Privacy Statement is posted or
						linked (collectively, “<b>this Website</b>”), Studio System Mobile (the “<b>Mobile App</b>”), and when
						we perform any activities that form part of the operation of this Website and/or the Mobile
						App and related services (e.g., when we send you marketing-related communications). This
						Privacy Statement also describes your choices and legal rights in relation to such
						information.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please note that this Privacy Statement applies only to information collected by Gracenote
						through your interaction with this Website and the Mobile App as well as through our
						performance of other activities that form part of the operation of this Website and the Mobile
						App and related services. Other websites and mobile apps, including websites and mobile
						apps provided by Nielsen’s group of companies and websites that may be accessible from
						this Website or the Mobile App, are governed by their own privacy statements. We
						encourage you to review all website and mobile app privacy statements before disclosing
						any information. To learn more about Nielsen’s group of companies, please click
						<a href="http://www.nielsen.com/eu/en/privacy-policy/gdpr-operating-entities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>Collection of Your Information</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						We collect or otherwise obtain information relating to you in a variety of ways. Such
						information may include personal information (i.e., information that alone or in combination
						with other information identifies you as an individual, such as your name, email address,
						phone number, and other data that can be reasonably linked to you as an individual).
						Additional details about the information we may gather about you can be found below.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you register or create an account on this Website or the Mobile App, submit a
						question or request (e.g., to learn more about our data and services), sign up for an event
						that we are hosting, or provide us with feedback, we will collect the information that you
						voluntarily provide, such as your name, email address, phone number, employment details,
						and geographical location. When you update/complete your profile, you will have the
						opportunity to provide us with additional information, such as your gender and additional
						contact details, including your physical address.
					</p>
					<p>
						This Website may host various blogs, message boards, forums, or other services (including
						social media services) that allow you to share information and content with other visitors.
						Any personal information or other information that you voluntarily post can be read,
						collected, and used by other visitors to this Website, and we have little or no control over
						how they may use such information. You should keep this in mind when sharing any
						personal information or other information on this Website.
					</p>
					<p>
						As is true of most websites and mobile apps, when you visit and browse this Website and/or
						use the Mobile App, we also gather certain information automatically, including log usage
						data (e.g., when you view or click on content) and information from your device and
						network, including your IP address, browser operating system and version, device identifier
						and features, access times, and referring website addresses.
					</p>
					<p>
						We use cookies (i.e., small text files placed on your device) and similar technologies (e.g.,
						web beacons, pixels, and ad tags) to enable certain features and functionality and collect
						additional information that helps us to improve this Website and the Mobile App and better
						deliver our services to you. In particular, we may use cookies (session cookies and
						persistent cookies) to identify your browser or device, display information more effectively,
						provide you with tailored content, and gather statistical information about how you use this
						Website and the Mobile App. We may also use such technologies for security purposes and
						to detect and defend against fraud and other risks in order to protect other visitors and
						users. If you do not wish to have information collected from your device by cookies, most
						browsers allow you to control and decline the use of cookies through the browser settings.
						Please note, however, that if you decline the use of cookies or limit our ability to set
						cookies, some features may not work properly. To learn more about cookies, including how
						to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, please visit
						<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						We also use Google Analytics, a web analytics tool that may set cookies, in order to help us
						understand how visitors and users engage with this Website and the Mobile App. To learn more
						about Google Analytics’ data practices, please visit <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en</a>.
						For opt-out options specific to Google Analytics, please visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						We generally do not seek sensitive personal information (e.g., information relating to an
						individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or other similar beliefs, health or medical
						conditions, criminal background, or trade union membership) about our visitors and users. If
						you voluntarily provide sensitive personal information for any reason or we are required to
						collect such information as a result of legal requirements imposed on us, we will, where
						necessary, obtain your explicit consent and use such information in accordance with this
						Privacy Statement and applicable law.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>Use of Your Information</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						We use your information for the purpose(s) for which it was collected or provided to us (as
						stated at the point of collection) or as otherwise obvious from the context of collection. We
						may also use your information to:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							administer and manage this Website and the Mobile App, communicate with you
							about this Website and the Mobile App, and respond to your inquiries and requests;
						</li>
						<li>
							customize or personalize your user experience and the content we deliver to you;
						</li>
						<li>
							conduct research and analytics about how you use and interact with this Website
							and the Mobile App;
						</li>
						<li>
							protect the rights, safety, property, or operations of Gracenote or our affiliates, you,
							or others; and
						</li>
						<li>
							respond to requests and communications from law enforcement authorities or other
							government officials.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						We may also use your information for marketing purposes or to send you promotional
						materials or other communications about Gracenote’s business, products/services, and
						events that may be of interest to you. You may unsubscribe from our mailing list at any time
						by contacting us at <a href="mailto:contact@gracenote.com">contact@gracenote.com</a> or through the unsubscribe link in any of our
						communications to you. After you unsubscribe, we will not send you further promotional
						materials or communications, but we may continue to contact you to the extent necessary
						for the purposes of any services you have requested.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>Legal Basis for the Processing of Your Personal Information</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Applicable law in your country of residence may require us to set out in this Privacy
						Statement the legal basis upon which we rely in order to process your personal information.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are based in the European Union (“<b>EU</b>”)/European Economic Area (“<b>EEA</b>”), we will
						process your personal information for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement based
						on: (a) the consent that you provide us at the point of collection of your personal information
						to use such information for certain specific purposes; or (b) our legitimate interests,
						provided that such interests are not overridden by your interests, fundamental rights, or
						freedoms. In particular, we may process your personal information in reliance on a
						legitimate interest in the effective and lawful operation of this Website, the Mobile App, and
						our business as well as the effective delivery of information and services to you. We may
						have other legitimate interests and, if so, we will make clear what those interests are at the
						relevant point in time. To the extent that we process any sensitive personal information
						relating to you, we will do so because either: (a) you have given us your explicit consent to
						process the information; (b) the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or
						defense of legal claims; or (c) you have made the information manifestly public.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you have any questions or concerns about the legal basis upon which we collect and use
						your personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy.department@nielsen.com">privacy.department@nielsen.com</a>.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>Disclosures of Your Information</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						In connection with one or more of the purposes outlined above, we may disclose your
						information to:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							other members of the <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/eu/en/privacy-policy/gdpr-operating-entities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nielsen group of companies</a>;
						</li>
						<li>
							third parties that provide services to us, such as system hosting, management, and
							support; data analysis; data backup; and security and storage services;
						</li>
						<li>
							relevant third parties as part of a corporate transaction, such as a reorganization,
							merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any
							portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with a bankruptcy or
							similar proceeding);

						</li>
						<li>
							competent governmental and public authorities, in each case to comply with legal or
							regulatory obligations or requests; and
						</li>
						<li>
							other third parties as we believe necessary or appropriate for legal purposes.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						All of these disclosures may result in the transfer of your information to countries or regions
						with data protection laws that differ from those in your country of residence. By providing us
						with your information and using this Website and/or the Mobile App, you are acknowledging
						that your information may be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence.
					</p>
					<p>
						In cases where your information is transferred outside of your country of residence, we will
						ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect your personal information. If
						you are based in the EU/EEA, such safeguards might include a data transfer agreement
						with the information recipient based on standard contractual clauses approved by the
						European Commission for transfers of personal information to third countries. For further
						details relating to the transfers described above and the adequate safeguards used with
						respect to such transfers, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy.department@nielsen.com">privacy.department@nielsen.com</a>.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>Minors</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Gracenote understands the importance of protecting the privacy of minors, especially in the
						online environment. This Website and the Mobile App are not designed for or intentionally
						targeted at minors under the age of 18. It is our policy to never knowingly collect or maintain
						personal information about anyone under the age of 18. If we become aware that we have
						collected personal information relating to a minor, we will take reasonable steps to delete it.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>Information Security</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						We have in place reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures that
						are designed to protect your information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access,
						disclosure, alteration, destruction, and other forms of unlawful processing while it is under
						our control. However, please be aware that the storage and transfer of information cannot
						always be one-hundred percent secure.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>Information Retention</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						We will retain your information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes set
						out in this Privacy Statement, unless applicable law or professional obligations requires a
						longer retention period.

					</h3>
