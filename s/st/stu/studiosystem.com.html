				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;">Baseline StudioSystems, Inc. (dba BaselineFT, Baseline/FilmTracker, baseline.filmtracker.com, filmtracker.com and baseline.hollywood.com, and Studio Systems, Inc.) ("Baseline") has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website:<br>
	<br>
	Baseline StudioSystems<br>
	We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website and services. Through customer surveys, subscriptions, and newsletter registration, our site may request users to give us contact information (such as their name, locale, and email address). The demographic information is used, among other things, to enhance user experience so we can be more content specific. The contact information is used to notify users of new services and content, as well as for surveys and newsletters. Our site uses an order form for customers to subscribe to our for-pay services. We collect contact information (like e-mail address) and financial information (like account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send billing invoices. Contact information is also used to get in touch with the subscribers when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future communications; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. We will never share personal financial information with any other parties. Information collected during Baseline subscriber registration is used for in-house statistics, marketing target information, and advising clients of Baseline news and information. This site contains links to other sites. Baseline is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.<br>
	<br>
	Baseline is committed to protecting your privacy online. Please read this privacy policy to fully understand how we will make use of the personal information you share with us. Baseline collects certain personal information in order to provide you with customized services, content, and advertisements. Some personal information is gathered when you register to receive certain Baseline products or services. We may disclose to third parties certain aggregate information contained in your registration data or related data, provided that, such information will NOT include personally indentifying information, except as specifically authorized by you or in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, legal process, or to enforce the terms of service. Baseline will also use your personal information for the purposes of providing you with any services to which you subscribe, and any service-related activities such as collecting subscription fees from you for those services, and notifying you or contacting you regarding any problem with, or the expiration of, such services. In this regard, it may be necessary for Baseline to disclose your personal information to one or more agents and contractors of Baseline and their subcontractors, but such agents, contractors, and subcontractors will be required to agree to use the information obtained from Baseline only for these purposes. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Baseline will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your Baseline account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Baseline cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. Baseline reserves the right to change this statement at any time by posting revisions on the Baseline web site. This privacy policy is not intended to, and does not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.<br>
	<br>
	Through surveys and newsletter registration, our site may request users to give us contact, demographic, and/or financial information (such as their name, locale, gender, age, income level and email address). The demographic information is used to enhance user experience so we can be more content specific. The contact information is used to notify users of new content, for surveys and newsletters, via email. Financial information that is collected is used primarily for in-house statistics, advertising, and marketing target information. ShowTimes Direct collects the user's zip code to provide specific theatre show times in their area. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.<br>
	<br>
	We may run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (such as their name and email address) and demographic information (such as their zip code, age, and/or income level). The user's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary, such as if they win a contest or to notify users of upcoming contests. There are three primary types of contests: (1.) We host solely and all information that is collected stays in-house. (2.) We may share address information with third party for shipping purposes. (3.) In some rare instances, a third party may host the contest and all information is then shared. In our contest registration, we give our users the opportunity to sign up for the Baseline newsletter. However, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by selecting the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the newsletter.<br>
	<br>

The parent or guardian must consent to Baseline's collection of their child's personal information.

No information collected from users known to be under age 13 will be used for any marketing or promotional purposes outside Baseline. If Baseline collects personally identifiable information from children, it will do so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Policy Act of 1998 (U.S.C. 6501 et seq.).<br>
