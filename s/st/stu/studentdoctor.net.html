            <p class="bluemenu">Privacy Statement</p>
            <p><strong>Registration</strong></p>
            <p>In order to use some sections of this Web site, you must first
              complete the registration form and create a user name and password.
              During registration you are required to give contact information
              (such as email address). We use this information to contact you
              about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.</p>
            <p>You
                have the option to provide demographic information (such as
                age and gender) to us; we encourage you to submit this information
              so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site.</p>
            <p>The
                Coastal Research Group is the sole owner of the information collected
                on The Student Doctor Network. The Student Doctor Network
                collects personally identifiable information from our users at
                several different points on our Web site.</p>            <p><strong>Orders</strong></p>
            <p>If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain 
              personally identifiable information from you on our order form. 
              You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping 
              address) and financial information (such as credit card number, 
              expiration date).</p>
            <p>We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. 
              If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information 
              to contact you.</p>
            <p><strong>Surveys or Contests</strong></p>
            <p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate
              in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will
              request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation
              in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore
              have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The
              requested
              information typically includes contact information (such as name
              and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip
              code).</p>
            <p>We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, 
              to monitor site traffic, and to improve or personalize the site 
              as appropriate.</p>
            <p>We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys 
              or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ 
              personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will 
              not share the personally identifiable information you provide through 
              a contest or survey with other third parties.</p>
            <p><strong>Tell-A-Friend</strong></p>
            <p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about 
              our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email 
              address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email 
              inviting him or her to visit the site. The Student Doctor Network 
              does not store this information.</p>
            <p class="subheader"><strong>Uses of Information</strong></p>
            <p>We use the personal information you supply us, including your registration 
              data, to enhance our services; fulfill your requests for products, 
              programs, or services; and personalize your experience. We also 
              use other information obtained from user site traffic patterns to 
              better provide you with a personalized experience. </p>
            <p>The Student Doctor Network uses the information described above 
              to do, among other things, the following: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Personalize and enhance the site and service such as providing 
                you with information we believe will be of interest to you. </li>
              <li>Contact users for feedback regarding The Student Doctor Network 
                via email surveys. </li>
              <li>We may also use the information we collect to develop summary 
                reports for our advertisers. An example of a summary report might 
                be "100,000 people clicked on this advertisement." We 
                provide this information to assist our advertisers in determining 
                how to promote their products. We do not tell our advertisers 
                who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Coastal Research Group may be required by law enforcement or 
              judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information 
              to appropriate governmental authorities. If requested by law enforcement 
              or judicial authorities, we will provide this information upon receipt 
              of the appropriate documentation. The Coastal Research Group may 
              also provide information to law enforcement to protect its property 
              and the health and safety of individuals as permitted by statute. 
            </p>
            <p>Other companies that place advertising on our site may collect 
              information about you when you view or click on their advertising 
              or content through the use of cookies (using the same techniques 
              as described above). Due to the way the Internet technically operates, 
              we cannot control this collection of information. As the consumer, 
              you should contact these advertisers or content providers that place 
              information on the Student Doctor Network directly if you have any 
              questions about their use of the information they potentially collect. 
            </p>
            <p>Information that you provide while using products such as SDN Forums 
              and SDN Chat is available for all to see. Discretion should be used 
              in entering Personally Identifiable Information within such forums, 
              as it may be collected by third parties. The Coastal Research Group 
              does not actively associate the message content entered by our users 
              in SDN Forums, or SDN Chat with those users' registration information. 
              Our server computers will retain this information, however; and 
              it is potentially available for distribution to third parties - 
              most obviously law-enforcement agencies acting under subpoena power, 
              per the terms of this section of our Privacy Policy. We do not use 
              this information to target any advertising to our users, nor is 
              it ever willingly distributed to any third party, such as an advertiser, 
            except if subpoenaed.</p>
            <p class="subheader"><strong>Communications from the Site</strong></p>
            <p><strong>SDN Forum Notices</strong></p>
            <p>We will occasionally send you email messages
                from the SDN Forums. We only send information that you specifically
                request during
                  registration
                  at the SDN Forums. This includes, but is not limited to, Private
                  Message notifications, subscribed thread notifications, system
                  updates
                  and birthday greetings. Out of respect for your privacy, we
            present the option not to receive these types of communications.</p>
            <p><strong>Newsletters</strong></p>
            <p>SDN does not currently offer a newsletter. However,
                this may be an option in the future. If it does become available,
                it
                    will be
                an opt-in newsletter only.</p>
            <p><strong>Service-related Announcements</strong></p>
            <p>We will send you strictly service-related
                announcements on rare  occasions when it is necessary to do so.
                For instance, if our service 
                is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an
                email.  Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications,
                which are 
                not promotional in nature.</p>
            <p><strong>Customer Service</strong></p>
            <p>Based upon the personally identifiable information
                you provide us,  we will send you a welcoming email to verify
              your username and password.
                We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries,
                 to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.
                
              We will communicate with you by email only.</p>
            <p class="subheader"><strong>Profile </strong></p>
            <p>We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, 
              clear gifs, and/or third party sources to create a “profile” 
              of your preferences. We do not tie your personally identifiable
              information, or your purchasing history, to information in the
            profile.</p>
            <p>We do not share your individual profile with other third
                parties.
                However, we may share information from your profile in aggregate
              form only.</p>
            <p class="subheader"><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</strong></p>
            <p>We
              share aggregated demographic information about our user base  with
              our advertisers. This information does not identify individual
              
              users. This includes, but is not limited to, age, gender, education
               status. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable
              
            information.</p>
            <p><strong>Personally identifiable information</strong></p>
            <p>We DO NOT Share Personally
                Identifiable Information with Third Parties</p>
            <p><strong>Agents</strong></p>
            <p>We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit 
              card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These 
              companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable 
            information for any other purposes.</p>
            <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
            <p>Other than Google (see below), we do not use other third parties 
              on our site.</p>
            <p class="body"><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong></p>
            <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable
              information  as required by law and when we believe that disclosure
              is necessary 
              to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding,
               court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
            <p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong></p>
            <p>We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having
              your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes,
              when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase
              a
              product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing
              material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order
            form.</p>
            <p>If you no longer wish to receive communications, you may opt-out
                of receiving them by following the instructions included in each
                newsletter or communication or by emailing us through our <a href="/corporate/contact_us.asp" class="body">contact 
              form</a>.</p>
            <p>You will be notified when your personal information is
                collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider,
                so you
                can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your
                information with that party.</p>
            <p><strong>Log Files</strong></p>
            <p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically
              and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol
              (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
              referring/exit
            pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
            <p>We
              use this information, which does not identify individual users,
              to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements
              around the site and to gather demographic information about our
            user base as a whole.</p>
            <p>We do link this automatically-collected data
                to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied
              to personally identifiable information
                to allow us to ban guests that repeatedly violate our terms of
              service and/or usage policies.</p>
            <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
            <p>A cookie is a small text file that is
                stored on a user’s computer 
                for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We
                do link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable
            information you submit while on our site.</p>
            <p>We use both session ID
                cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make
                it easier for you to navigate our site.
              A session
              ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie
              remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You
              can
              remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your
            Internet browser’s “help” file.</p>
            <p>Cookies are used to
              enhance your experience at the SDN Forums. We set a persistent
              cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t 
                have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable
              us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
              experience on our site.</p>
            <p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability
              to use some areas of our site, such as the SDN Forums, will be
            limited.</p>
            <p>Some advertisers use cookies on our site. We have no access
              to
              or control over these cookies. See “Third Party Advertisers.” 
              This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site only 
              and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. See the 
            “Third Party Advertisers” section.</p>
            <p><strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong></p>
            <p>We employ, and/or our
              third party advertising partner, Google, may employ a software
              technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web
              Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing
              us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with
              a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used
              to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies,
              which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs 
              are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the 
              period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information 
              gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable
            information.</p>
            <p>To learn more about Google's use of clear gifs, please
            go to <a href="http://www.google.com" class="body">www.google.com</a>.</p>
            <p>We
              may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which
              emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to
              gauge the
              effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of
              our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these
              emails,
            please see “Choice and Opt-out."</p>

            <p><strong>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
            <p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you

            <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
            <p>The security of your personal information is important to us.
              When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number)
              on
              our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using
            secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
            <p>We follow generally accepted
                industry standards to protect the
                personal information submitted to us, both during transmission
                and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet,
                or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore,
                while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect
            your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

            <p><strong>Business Transitions</strong></p>
            <p>In the event The Coastal Research Group goes through a business
              transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another organization,
              or distribution of all or a portion of its assets, your personally
              identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.
              You will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30
              days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal
              information.</p>
