<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The StudentAwards Inc. privacy policy statement demonstrates our deep commitment to your privacy rights. Since we gather certain types of information about our users, we want the user to fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement describes what information we gather, the purpose for which we gather it, how we use it, disclose it, and how to correct or change it. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Usage Tracking<br>
</strong>StudentAwards Inc. tracks information related to overall user traffic patterns throughout our site in order to make decisions regarding content and services. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Log Files<br>
</strong>Log files are used to track and monitor traffic patterns on our site for maintenance purposes, to enhance usability and to improve overall user experience and site performance. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Registration</strong> <br>
In order to use studentawards.com services, users are required to complete an online registration form. StudentAwards Inc. collects that information for the purpose of informing students, parents, educators and others about opportunities to obtain awards, scholarships, bursaries and other funding and useful goods and services related to schools and education generally. To register, the user is asked to supply certain personal information such as email address, name, and home address. StudentAwards Inc. also collects personal information such as postal code, age, gender, academic information, interests and hobbies. This information is required if the user wants to be matched to the awards in the studentawards.com scholarship database. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Notification of New Awards<br>
</strong>On an ongoing basis, StudentAwards Inc. enters new awards into its database and also updates existing awards. When an existing user matches on a new or updated award, StudentAwards Inc. may send an email message or newsletter advising the user to return to the studentawards.com web site to view the new award information. These email messages may also contain messages provided by our sponsors. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Email Messages<br>
</strong>StudentAwards Inc. periodically provides opportunities for our sponsors to send email messages to our users that are considered by StudentAwards Inc. to be relevant and of interest to the students, parents or educators who use our service. No personally identifiable information is released by StudentAwards Inc. to our sponsors without the user's consent. Email messages may also invite users to take advantage of various promotions, complete surveys, etc. that also allow our awards search service to be provided free of charge. We gather the email addresses of users who voluntarily opt-in during our registration process. Users may remove themselves from this email list by logging into their studentawards.com account and selecting the appropriate options located in the Account Settings section under My Profile. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>User Comments/Posts<br>
</strong>Users have the ability to comment and post messages publically on the studentawards.com website.&nbsp; All posted information must abide by StudentAwards Inc.&nbsp;<a href="/terms-of-use.aspx">Terms of Use</a>.&nbsp; By submitting comments and posts, users grant StudentAwards Inc.&nbsp;non-exclusive right to use that content royalty-free.&nbsp;The views and opinions of the user content published on our site do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of StudentAwards Inc.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Cookies<br>
</strong>Studentawards.com minimizes the use of cookies to only those necessary to properly route users within our site as well as to track aggregate traffic coming to the site. Cookies add a convenience feature to help the user save time. They are primarily used to help personalize the users' experience on the site.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Outside Links<br>
</strong>This site contains links to other sites. Users will be taken to a separate site if they click on one of these links.

StudentAwards Inc. is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on any other web site a user visits. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Other Circumstances<br>
</strong>From time to time, StudentAwards Inc. may sponsor sweepstakes, contests or other events that require the collection, processing, and storage of individual contact and demographic information to be used for the event. StudentAwards Inc. may also co-sponsor these events along with other companies but the user's individual contact and demographic information will not be released to non-participating organizations without the users’ consent.

<strong>Use of Information <br>
</strong>There are cases where StudentAwards Inc. asks for personal information such as name, email address, and birth date.

<p style="text-align: justify;">We also use information, which users voluntarily provide, in order to send out electronic newsletters and mailings.
