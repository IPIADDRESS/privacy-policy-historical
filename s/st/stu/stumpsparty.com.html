      <h3>Site Security</h3>
      <p>At StumpsParty.com, your security is our 
        number one concern. We are pleased to tell you about the measures we have 
        taken to ensure your security. </p>
      <p>We have followed and surpassed all industry standards necessary for a 
        secure site. We are a GeoTrust™ secure site. This means that all information 
        sent to our site is encrypted and protected against disclosure to third 
        parties. </p>
      <!-- GeoTrust True Site[tm] Smart Icon tag. Do not edit. -->
<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src="//smarticon.geotrust.com/si.js"></script>
<!-- end GeoTrust Smart Icon tag -->
      <p>Our servers use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). This is an advanced technology 
        that <b>encrypts all of the information you send us</b> (this includes 
        all of your personal information such as your name, address, credit card 
        number, etc.) so that it cannot be read as the information as it travels 
        over the Internet. </p>
      <p>SSL works with Microsoft Internet Explorer (v. 3.0 and higher), Netscape 
        Navigator (v. 2.0 and higher) and America Online (v. 3.0 and higher). 
      </p>
      <p>To ensure that you are accessing our secure server to place your order, 
        look at the bottom left-hand corner of your browser. You should see a 
        closed lock or unbroken key icon (depending on your browser). If you see 
        either of these icons, then SSL is active. </p>
      <h4>Cookies</h4>

        disk, and is very common on the Internet. They are a way for StumpsParty.com

        in your shopping bag as you browse through our product selection. However, 
        you can still browse our products and use many of our site features without 
        cookies. </p>

      <h4>Fair Credit Billing Act</h4>

        hold you responsible for more than $50 of any unauthorized or fraudulent 
        charges on your credit card. In the event of any unauthorized use of your
