practices and inform you as to: (1) our privacy practices with respect to
children under the age of 13; (2) the types of personally identifiable
information ("Personal Information") we collect from users of the
Site; (3) how Personal Information is collected; (4) how we use Personal

protect your Personal Information. As we continue to update our website with
new and different types of products and services, we may modify our Privacy
Policy from time to time. However, we will treat all personal information we
collect in accordance with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the
information is collected. This Privacy Policy is a part of our <span style="color:#1F497D">Terms of Service</span>. Any terms that are not defined

<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_DV_M4"></a><span style="font-family:Times">We
recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections for younger
children who visit our Site.  The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
(“COPPA”) requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we
collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of
age and that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for
children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our Site. <b>Please
be aware that our Children’s Privacy Policy, viewable here <a href="/main/coppa"><span style="text-decoration:none;

<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_DV_M18"></a><span style="font-family:Times">Visitors
to the Site may browse stories on the Site without providing any Personal
Information. To participate in our basic and premium memberships and to
purchase products from us, however, we ask the user to register for an account
on the Site and to provide us with certain Personal Information as further
described below. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_DV_M19"></a><span style="font-family:Times">Where
a visitor self-identifies as 13 years and older during the registration
process, we will collect a valid e-mail address, birth date, username and password
from the user.  In the event that the user purchases a premium membership to
the Site or orders a product from us (for example, a book), we will collect
name, credit card and billing information (including telephone number and
billing address), and we may collect additional information such as gender and
country of residence.  </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_DV_M20"></a><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">We
may also request a user name and email address when a user submits a form
through our "Contact Us" feature on the Site so that we may respond
to the inquiry. We will use the e-mail address submitted through the “Contact
Us” feature for the single purpose of responding directly on a one-time basis
to a specific inquiry. We also may collect information about you and your use
of our Site, services and/or software through your use of our Site, services

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_DV_M21"></a><span style="font-family:Times">Additionally,
when visitors come to our Site, we automatically collect some non-personally
identifiable information about the user’s computer and/or browser, such as type
of computer operating system (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), the visitor's
"IP Address", the web browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer)

<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_DV_M22"></a><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">From
time to time, StoryJumper may provide you with the opportunity to participate
in online contests. To participate in a contest, a user may be asked to provide
certain Personal Information, such as name and email address. Participation in
these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a
choice whether or not to disclose this information. </span></p>

register to use the Site and the services on our Site, enter our online
contests, send our online newsletter, inform users of upcoming events and
special announcements, contact them to deliver certain products and other
tangible goods that they have purchased from us (such as books, t-shirts,

<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_DV_M25"></a><span style="font-family:Times">We use
a parent’s or legal guardian's email address to send the parent or legal
guardian a message that can be used to activate an account and provide consent

send the parent or legal guardian communications about the account. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_DV_M26"></a><span style="font-family:Times">We
also use users’ Computer Information to track how the Site is being used, to
improve our Site design, to offer products and services, to personalize our

enable you to use shopping carts on our Site, and to ensure users are following
the Site's Terms of Service. In some cases we may provide your Personal
Information to third party vendors and suppliers that we engage to help us
provide services to our users. For example, we may engage third parties to
process your payments, produce products and other tangible goods that you order
from us and/or help us fulfill contests and sending prizes to the winners.  In
these cases, we require the third party to keep the information secure and
confidential and to use it only for the specific services they are performing
for us.  Additionally, in the event of a merger, consolidation or other
corporate reorganization in which StoryJumper participates or a sale of all or
substantially all of StoryJumper, Inc.'s stock and/or assets to which this Site
relates, we may transfer your personal information to the successor entity or

when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities
conducting an investigation or by applicable law, rule or regulation, to verify
