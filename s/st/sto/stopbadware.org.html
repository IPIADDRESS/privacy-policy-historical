			<p>The Berkman Center and its researchers (“we” or "us") are conducting an academic research project that examines problems raised by “adware,” “spyware,” and other kinds of potentially harmful, downloadable computer programs.  As part of this project, this website, www.stopbadware.org (the "Site"), collects information submitted by users through the online “Request for Review” form, “Technical Data Report” form, the “Tell Us Your Badware Horror Story” form, the mailing list sign-up form or check-boxes and any information you post to our online discussion groups.  Some additional information is automatically collected when you visit the Site.  We use this information for research, and we may share some of this information with other researchers. In addition, information from the Request for Review form may be shared with third parties as described below.</p>
<p>We are committed to respecting and protecting your personal privacy.  This Privacy Statement describes what information the Site collects, how this information is used, and with whom we may share the information.  Your submission of data to the Site indicates your agreement with the terms of the Privacy Statement.</p>
<h3>Request for Review Responses</h3>
<p>The information that you submit in the Request for Review form may be used by us for research into the problems of adware, spyware, and other kinds of potentially harmful computer programs, and for other purposes. We may share all information entered into this form – including your name and email address – with any third parties that have submitted your site to the Badware Website Clearinghouse. We may also publicly display on our website or share with other researchers any information submitted in fields other than the Name and Email Address fields in the Request for Review form.</p>
<p>Should you include additional personally identifying information within your responses, this information may be included in the information that is shared with third parties, other researchers, or posted on our site. We are not asking you for any such personally identifying information and we strongly encourage you not to submit such information as part of your Request for Review form or other communications with us if you do not wish to have it shared with other researchers.</p>
<h3>Technical Data Report Responses</h3>
<p>The information that you submit in response to the Technical Data Report form may be used by us for research into the problems of adware, spyware, and other kinds of potentially harmful computer programs.  We may share information other than your e-mail address with third parties who are engaged in research or analysis that we believe in good faith is legitimate. For instance, we intend to make some version of our data-set available generally to members of the public who are also working to put an end to badware, which may include other academic researchers, policy-makers, and companies. We also may make aggregate data that does not include personally identifying information available generally to the public. Should you include personally identifying information within your responses, such as your name, this information may be included in the information that is shared with other researchers. We are not asking you for any such personally identifying information and we strongly encourage you not to submit such information as part of your Technical Data Reports or other communications with us if you do not wish to have it shared with other researchers.</p>
<p>We will not share your e-mail address, if you choose to submit it, with third parties unless you indicate in the Technical Data Report form “opt in” checkbox that you are willing to be contacted for the purposes of further research.  If you check this box, you may be contacted either by us or by other researchers regarding their research into adware, spyware, or related problems.  We will only share your e-mail address with outside researchers who agree to keep your e-mail private.</p>
<h3>Tell Us Your Badware Horror Story Form Responses</h3>
<p>If you elect to complete the voluntary Tell Us Your Badware Horror Story form, you will be asked to include your name and e-mail address.  By completing this form, you give us and/or our designees permission to contact you about the possible inclusion of your story in materials promoting public awareness of the Site and of the problem of adware and spyware.  We will not share your name and e-mail address with any other parties without your consent.</p>
<h3>Mailing List Sign-Up Form and Check Boxes</h3>
<p>If you elect to sign up for our mailing list, we will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you announcements relating to StopBadware.org’s efforts, new badware reports and updates to the Site. We will not share your email address with any other parties without your consent.</p>
<h3>Discussion Groups</h3>
<p>If you elect to sign up for and participate in our discussion groups, any content you contribute or other information you submit may be publicly displayed, including personally identifying information.</p>
<h3>Information the Site Automatically Collects</h3>
<p>When you complete the Technical Data Report form, the Site records data on the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer that you are using, the browser version that you are using to access the Site, and the operating system installed and running on the computer that you are using. We use this information as part of our spyware and adware research.  We may share this information, along with your responses, with third parties who are engaged in research that we believe in good faith is legitimate and who agree to use the information for research purposes only.</p>
<p>Whether or not you submit information through the Site, the Site logs the IP address of the computer you are using when you visit the Site.  The log enables us to measure the number of visitors to the Site, diagnose and correct system errors and improve the usability of the Site, and we also may use it to compile aggregate data for research purposes.  We do not use IP address logs to track your session, and logged data is deleted periodically.</p>
<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
<p>We may make some of the automatically collected information available to Google Inc. for Google Analytics, a service that helps us to better understand how our visitors use the Site and how the Site can be improved.  This information may include IP addresses, browser versions used by visitors, and the pages visited on the Site.  This data is analyzed in the aggregate, and individuals are not tracked.  No personally identifying information will be submitted to Google for the purposes of the Google Analytics service.</p>
<h3>Commercial Use of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We will never rent or sell your information to anyone.  We will not share your name or e-mail address with third parties except as described above and only on the condition that the third parties agree not to use your name or e-mail for commercial purposes.</p>
<h3>Disclosure of Information to Law Enforcement</h3>
<p>If we receive a warrant or subpoena for user information, we may disclose requested records to law enforcement authorities or outside parties seeking information through the legal process.  In the event that we are required by law (including a court order) to disclose the information you submit and we have your contact information, we will provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made so that you may object to the disclosure. We will send this notice by e-mail to the address you have given us. We prefer to independently object to over-broad requests for access to information about users of the Site, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this in all cases. If you do not challenge the disclosure request yourself, we may be legally required to turn over your information.</p>
<h3>Removing Your Submitted Data</h3>
<p>Your responses to the Technical Data Report and Tell Us Your Badware Horror Story forms may be deleted from the Site upon your request by contacting us via e-mail at webmaster@stopbadware.org.  You may also unsubscribe from our mailing lists by contacting us via e-mail at webmaster@stopbadware.org. Within a reasonable time after receiving your request, the administrators will delete your responses, and your information will not be included in future research by us or be further distributed to other researchers.  We will not be able to ask other researchers or other third parties who have already received this information to delete it or to stop using it in their research.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>The Site uses session cookies that record the IP address, browser and operating system of computers used to access the Site, as well as information about navigation through pages of the Site.  Session cookies are temporary files that are erased when you close all browser windows.  The cookies are in place to help the Site work properly and to improve the user experience and will not be used to track your individual use of the Site.</p>
<h3>Links to Independent Websites</h3>
<p>Pages hosted by the Site may link to independently-run web sites.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such web sites.</p>
<h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>

If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child under age 13 who you believe has submitted personal information to the Site, please contact us immediately at webmaster@stopbadware.org.</p>
<h3>Changes to the Privacy Statement</h3>
<p>We retain the right to make changes, in our sole discretion, to this Privacy Statement. Any changes will be reflected in the Privacy Statement when the changes take effect.  The privacy policies that apply to any information you submit will be those contained in the Privacy Statement that is in effect and posted on the Site at the time that you submit the information.  Please review the Privacy Statement each time you use the Site.</p>
