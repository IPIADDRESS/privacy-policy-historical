<b>Information Automatically Logged</b></p><p>

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website, monitor site usage and help us collect
broad demographic information.  Such statistics help us identify popular areas so we can improve the visitor experience.</p><p>

<b>Cookies</b></p><p>

The StorkNet message boards use cookies so you don't have to re-enter your user name and password each time you visit the boards.  A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any
personally identifiable information while on our site.  Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates.  Cookies are
not executable pieces of code and cannot do anything to your hard drive.  They are merely pieces of “text” stored on your computer.  They are easy to delete from your hard drive (and it's not a bad idea to do this once in awhile).</p><p>

If you would like to know more about cookies, read the US Government Information Bulletin (I-034) regarding cookie technology at <a href="http://www.ciac.org/ciac/bulletins/i-034.shtml" target="_TOP">http://www.ciac.org/ciac/bulletins/i-034.shtml</a>.</p><p>

<b>Advertisers</b></p><p>

We use an outside advertising company to display some of the ads on our site.  These ads may contain cookies.  While we use cookies on our message boards, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad agency, and we do not have access to this info.  To find out more about how Burst! Media manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on this site, please visit <b><a href="http://www.burstmedia.com/release/privacy.asp" target="_TOP">Burst!

<b>Message Board Registration</b></p><p>

Our Message Boards require registration to post, and the registration form requires users to give us their name and email.  Users have the option to make their email address private or public.  If a user opts to make their email public, StorkNet is not responsible for any spam or other email received from visitors to our message boards.  Our message board software gives users the ability to “opt-out” of administrative mailings regarding the message board.  </p><p>

<b>Public Forums</b></p><p>

StorkNet makes message board forums, chat rooms and email available to its users.  Please be aware that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information, and care should be exercised when deciding to disclose personal information.  StorkNet cannot be responsible for the information users post in these public areas.</p><p>

<b>Email Service</b></p><p>

Users of our free email service are required to complete a personal profile with everyone.net (our email service provider).  Please review <b><a href="http://www.everyone.net/main/html/p_policy.html" target="_TOP">everyone.net's privacy statement</a></b> for more details.</p><p>

<b>Surveys and Contests</b></p><p>

From time to time, our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  This information is not shared with any third party.  Survey
information is used for purposes of monitoring or improving use and satisfaction of StorkNet and your name is not required.</p><p>

<b>External Links</b></p><p>

This site contains links to other sites.  StorkNet is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.  When you click on a link that takes you off a StorkNet site, this Privacy Policy no longer applies including e-commerce sites listed in the StorkNet Mall.</p><p>

<b>Newsletters</b></p><p>

If you subscribe to our Before Birth and Beyond newsletter, you will not receive separate email from other companies as a result of subscribing to our newsletter.  Subscribed addresses are not shared or sold with other companies.  If you decide to unsubscribe, you may do so via the link provided in the newsletter or going to <b><a href="http://www.storknet.com/newsletter">http://www.storknet.com/newsletter</a></b>.</p><p>

<b>Send This Page to a Friend Feature</b></p><p>

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, the user is asked for the friend's name and email address. StorkNet automatically sends the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.  This information is not stored and the friend will never receive another email from StorkNet as a result of this service.</p><p>
