<p>StomperNet encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from StomperNet so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. StomperNet is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the StomperNet and StomperNet family of Web sites.</p>
<p><strong>Use of your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>StomperNet collects and uses your personal information to operate the StomperNet Web site and deliver the services you have requested. StomperNet also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from StomperNet and its affiliates.

<p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong></p>
<p>The StomperNet Web site use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize StomperNet pages, or register with StomperNet site or services, a cookie helps StomperNet to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same StomperNet Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the StomperNet features that you customized.</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the StomperNet services or Web sites you visit.</p>
<p><strong>Security of your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>StomperNet secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. StomperNet secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Statement</strong></p>
<p>StomperNet will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. StomperNet encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how StomperNet is protecting your information.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Information</strong></p>
