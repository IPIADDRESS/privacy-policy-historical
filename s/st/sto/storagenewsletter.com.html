<h1>Our privacy policy</h1>
<p>Our privacy policy is quite simple : we do not collect anymore data than what is necessary for our run off the mill statistics product (at this time <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>).</p>

<p>All we can know about you is unidentifiable data (your browser, your ISP, your operating system, and so on). This is information that any website on the internet have.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you contact us by email, we do not keep, or otherwise use, your email for any other purpose than responding to your request.</p>

<h2>&gt; Your email address</h2>
<p>If you choose to subscribe to one of our newsletters, we will then need to keep your email address. But we will never sell, share or otherwise communicate 
it with anybody else.</p>

<p>There are, however, two understandable exceptions to that rule : 

</p><ul>
<li>If forced by applicable law, we will have to disclose your email address, but to law enforcement only.</li>
<li>If we do use a third-party service to send out our newsletters, this service will need to know which addresses to send the emails to. Those companies are professionals, and bound by contract to NOT use the emails they send newsletters to for their own benefit. And we are very careful selecting only reputable companies for that job.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h2>&gt; Our Opt-In program</h2>
<p>If you decide to "opt-in" to receive additional emails from us on behalf or our partners, we will send you very few extra emails with what we believe are good deals for you. We do not share your email with those partners : we send the emails ourselves or through a professionnal emailing service. Our partners will never get your email address from us.</p>

<p>Also, this "opt-in" program is purely on a voluntary basis. By default all our newsletter subscribers are NOT opted-in. You have to select it yourself AFTER your free newsletter subscription is done. And of course, you can opt-out at anytime.</p>

<h2>&gt; In short</h2>
<p>What all of this means is that we are not spammers, not even in the marketing business, and we will not abuse the privilege of sending you emails.</p>
<p>We are in the publishing business, and our readers loyalty is what really counts for us and what will keep us in business. So we will not engage in dodgy tactics with your personal information ! Promised.</p>
