<p class="is-animated">Below is our privacy statement which incorporates these principles.</p>
<p class="is-animated"><strong>Last updated: 8th October 2018</strong></p>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>This is the privacy and cookies statement (the “Statement”) for&nbsp;www.<u><a href="http://storyful.com/">storyful.com</a></u>&nbsp;including the mobile site, Storyful platform(s), applications and widgets associated with it, our products&nbsp;and our associated services (respectively, the&nbsp;Site and the Services). The Site is operated by Storyful Limited (“Storyful”, “<strong>we</strong>”,&nbsp;“<strong>us</strong>”&nbsp;and&nbsp;“<strong>our</strong>”). For the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation 2018, we are the data controller.</p>
<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy online. In this Statement we explain how we collect information, what we do with it and what controls you have. By using the Site, or by engaging with us in relation to our Services (including content creators who provide information in relation to content that they publish), you consent to the collection and use of your Personal Data in accordance with this Statement. Your “Personal Data” means any information relating to you in identified or identifiable form.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to change this Statement from time to time by changing it on the Site. This Statement was last updated on the date set out at the beginning of it.</p>
<p>The Statement describes the types of Personal Data we process, namely Personal Data of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our suppliers (including content creators and licensors);</li>
<li>Customers;</li>
<li>Partners;</li>
<li>Any visitors to our Site or otherwise in connection with our Services; and</li>
<li>Certain data subjects where the personal data we process is data that has been made publicly available by the data subject (e.g. through public posts on social media platforms) at the time of collection.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Statement also describes how we use that Personal Data, the bases upon which we collect it and with whom we share it.&nbsp; We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of Personal Data and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.&nbsp; The Services we provide are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from people that are 16 years of age or younger.</p>
<h3>2. Information we may collect from you and the basis for collection</h3>
<p>We collect Personal Data in order to offer Services that you have requested, where we legitimately believe there is an interest on your part in such Services, and/or where we believe Storyful has a legitimate interest in doing so, on the following bases:</p>
<ul>
<li>in order to perform activities based on your consent (to the extent it is required by applicable law);</li>
<li>for the purpose of compliance with a contract to which Storyful is a party; or</li>
<li>as is necessary to fulfil an identified legitimate interest of Storyful, having regard to the requirement to balance that interest against the rights and freedoms of any affected data subjects, including, but not limited to:
<ol>
<li>monitoring and improving our Services to our partners and potential partners; and</li>
<li>managing the relationships we have with our current suppliers, customers and partners.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We may collect and process the following information, including Personal Data, about you:</p>
<ul>
<li>information (such as your name, email address, social media details, postal address and telephone number) that you provide by completing forms on the Site or otherwise in connection with the Services including if you register as a subscriber or contributor to any service, upload or submit any material via the Site, request any information, or enter into any competition or promotion we may sponsor;</li>
<li>in connection with an account sign-in facility, your log-in and password details;</li>
<li>details of any transactions made by you through the Services;</li>
<li>details of your use of our Site and/or our Services;</li>
<li>communications you send to us, for example to report a problem or to submit queries, concerns or comments regarding the Site, its content or the Services.</li>
<li>information from surveys that we may, from time to time, run on the Site or as part of the Services for research purposes, if you choose to respond to, or participate in, them. You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services;</li>
<li>to the extent that it is publicly available, information from public social media platforms such as your name and/or other online identifier, your email address, gender, location and relevant social media posts; and</li>
<li>in addition to the foregoing relating to publicly available information from social media platforms, we may add such Persona Data to a central relational database which may draw in data relating to individuals from different publicly facing social media platforms. For example, if we use content from a particular YouTube subscriber, that individual may be added to our central relational database and we may augment the relevant profile with information from other publicly available social media accounts that the individual might have (for example, their Twitter or Facebook accounts).</li>
</ul>
<p>In respect of information gathered as a result of your use of our Site and or Services, your decision to use this Site and/or our Services and to provide that Personal Data, is voluntary. We indicate on our online forms, where applicable, what types of Personal Data are required, before you register to our Services and submit any Personal Data to us.</p>
<p><strong>For more information about how and on what basis Storyful processes your personal data, please contact </strong><strong><a href="mailto:privacy@storyful.com">privacy@storyful.com</a></strong><strong> setting out your query in reasonable detail. </strong></p>
<h3>3. Information you provide about third parties</h3>
<p>Where information you provide, including content you submit to us, contains Personal Data of others, we may ask you to provide us with the details of your relationship with those individuals. We will only use those details to provide a description of your content, for verification purposes, or otherwise pursuant to terms agreed with you. By providing this information to us, you agree to our use of such information for these purposes. When you upload content to our Site, you warrant that you have permission from those individuals to appear in that content and for us to use their Personal Data in accordance with our agreement with you.
