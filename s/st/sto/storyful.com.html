<p class="is-animated"><strong>Last updated: 8th January 2018</strong></p>
<h2 class="h3 is-animated">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the privacy and cookies statement (the “Statement”) for Storyful.com including the mobile site, platform, applications and widgets associated with it&nbsp;and our associated services (respectively, the&nbsp;Site and the Services). The Site is operated by Storyful Limited (“Storyful”, “<b>we</b>”,&nbsp;“<b>us</b>”&nbsp;and&nbsp;“<b>our</b>”). For the purposes of the Irish Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, as amended, we are the data controller.&nbsp;We are committed to protecting your privacy online. In this Statement we explain how we collect information, what we do with it and what controls you have. By using the Site, or by engaging with us in relation to our Services (including content creators who provide information in relation to sourcing content and influencers who engage with us in relation to a brand), you consent to the collection and use of your Personal Data in accordance with this Statement. Your “Personal Data” means any information relating to you in identified or identifiable form.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to change this Statement from time to time by changing it on the Site. This Statement was last updated on the date set out at the beginning of it.</p>
<p>The Statement describes the types of Personal Data we obtain about uploaders, partners and any visitors to our Site or otherwise in connection with our Services, how we use the Personal Data and with whom we share it. We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of Personal Data and how you can contact us about our privacy practices. The Services we provide are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 13 years of age.</p>
<h2 class="h3 is-animated">2. Information we may collect from you</h2>
<p>We collect Personal Data to offer Services that you have requested or where we legitimately believe there is an interest on your part in such Services, to manage the relationship we have with our customers and partners and to perform activities based on your consent. We may collect and process the following information, including Personal Data, about you:</p>
<ul class="is-animated">
<li>information (such as your name, email address, social media details, postal address and telephone number) that you provide by completing forms on the Site or otherwise in connection with the Services including if you register as a subscriber or contributor to any service, upload or submit any material via the Site, request any information, or enter into any competition or promotion we may sponsor;</li>
<li>in connection with an account sign-in facility, your log-in and password details;</li>
<li>details of any transactions made by you through the Services;</li>
<li>communications you send to us, for example to report a problem or to submit queries, concerns or comments regarding the Site, its content or the Services; and</li>
<li>information from surveys that we may, from time to time, run on the Site or as part of the Services for research purposes, if you choose to respond to, or participate in, them. You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your decision to use this Site and/or our Services in providing your Personal Data is voluntary. We indicate on our online forms, where applicable, what types of Personal Data are required, before you register to our Services and submit any Personal Data to us.</p>
<h2 class="h3 is-animated">3. Information you provide about third parties</h2>
<p>Where information you provide, including content you submit to us, contains Personal Data of others, we may ask you to provide us with the details of your relationship with those individuals. We will only use those details to provide a description of your content, for verification purposes, or otherwise pursuant to terms agreed with you. By providing this information to us, you agree to our use of such information for these purposes. When you upload content to our Site, you warrant that you have permission from those individuals to appear in that content and for us to use their Personal Data in accordance with our agreement with you. You must not provide us with the details of anyone from whom you do not have such permission. We reserve the right to identify you as the person who has guaranteed that such individuals have given this permission.</p>
<h2 class="h3 is-animated">4. Information Obtained by Automated Means Through Our Services</h2>
<p>When you visit the Site or as part of our Services we may automatically collect additional information about you, such as the type of Internet browser you use, any website from which you have come to the Site and your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the Internet) which is automatically recognised by our web server. This information is only used to assist us in providing an effective service on the Site and to collect broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
<h2 class="h3 is-animated">5. Cookies</h2>
<p>Storyful makes use of a number of cookies in the provision of Our Services. For more information, please refer to our&nbsp;<a href="/cookie-notice">Cookie Notice</a>.</p>

<h2>7. Information sharing</h2>
<p>We may disclose aggregate statistics about visitors to the Site, those who engage with our Services, customers and sales in order to describe our Services to prospective partners, advertisers, sponsors and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include no Personal Data.</p>
<p>If you upload, grant clearance in respect of, sell, licence or otherwise provide content, including video content to Storyful, when we distribute that content to our partners, or where you otherwise engage with our Services, we may disclose your Personal Data to our partners in order for them to independently verify the content you have submitted to us. This disclosure may include your name, Facebook, Twitter or other social media profile information and location and may also include other information you have provided to us, such as your email address and phone number and location of where the content was filmed. At the point at which you submit your content to us, you are required to acknowledge that this disclosure will be made and by continuing to upload your details you continue to agree to such disclosure.</p>
<p>Payment details you provide will be encrypted using secure sockets layer (SSL) technology before they are submitted to us over the Internet. Payments made on the Site are made through our payment gateway provider, Braintree. You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to Braintree which operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorising payment. For more information on Braintree’s privacy and security practices, please visit Braintree’s privacy policy and terms and conditions.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your Personal Data to any of our affiliates, or to our agents or contractors who assist us in providing the Services we offer including those provided through the Site, processing transactions, fulfilling requests for information, receiving and sending communications, updating marketing lists, analysing data, providing support services or in other tasks, from time to time. Our agents and contractors will only use your information to the extent necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.</p>
<p>We require our service providers to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Data, and to ensure that Personal Data is processed only for the provision of services on our behalf and in compliance with applicable law.&nbsp; Service providers are not authorized to use or disclose Personal Data, except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.</p>
<p>We may share your information with News Corp (our ultimate parent company) and any entity who is a News Corp affiliate who may be outside of the EEA for use in accordance with this Statement. A current list of our News Corp affiliated companies is available at <a href="http://newscorp.com/about/our-businesses/">https://newscorp.com/about/our-businesses/</a>.</p>
<p>We may further disclose information about you (1) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (2) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, and (3) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity. We also reserve the right to transfer Personal Data we have about you in the event of a proposed or completed sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).</p>

<h2 class="h3 is-animated">8. Child safety</h2>
<p>Protecting the safety of children when they use the Internet is very important to us. We do not knowingly collect information from minors without seeking parental or guardian consent. We recommend that children receive permission from their parent or guardian before gaining access to our Services or sending Personal Data to us or anyone else online. Where we become aware that content may have been uploaded by a minor, we will contact the uploader to seek further permissions before using the content further. If content provided by you contains children, you must seek parental or guardian consent to share the video with us. When you submit the video, you declare that you have such permissions.</p>
<h2 class="h3 is-animated">9. External links</h2>
<p class="is-animated">The Site may, from time to time, contain links to external sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites.</p>
<h2 class="h3 is-animated">10. Security and Retention of Personal Data</h2>
<p>We place great importance on the security of the Personal Data associated with our users. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the Personal Data we have about you against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.&nbsp; We make reasonable efforts to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing, taking into account the costs of implementation and nature of the processing of Personal Data.</p>
<p>You should bear in mind that submission of information over the Internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Site or Services whilst it is in transit over the Internet and any such submission is at your own risk.&nbsp;It is advisable to close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your Personal Data if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We retain Personal Data for the period needed to fulfil the purposes for which Personal Data was collected and as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law, such as in relation to our record retention obligations.</span></p>
<h2 class="h3 is-animated">11. Transfer and Storage of your information</h2>
<p>Information that you submit via the Site and/or the Services is sent to and stored on secure servers located in the United States and in the EEA. Information submitted by you may also be transferred by us to our other offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances described above (see Information sharing), which may be situated outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and/or the United States and may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA and/or the United States. The countries concerned may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA or the United States. Where we transfer your information we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected. This may include data transfer agreements, a copy of which you can obtain by contacting us as indicated in the “Contacting us” section below.</p>
<p>When you give us information about another person, you confirm that they have appointed you to act for them and agreed to the transfer of their information abroad.</p>
