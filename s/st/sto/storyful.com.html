For the purposes of the Irish Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, as amended, we are the data controller.&nbsp;We are committed to protecting your privacy online. In this Statement we explain how we collect information, what we do with it and what controls you have. By using the Site, or by engaging with us in relation to our Services (including content creators who provide information in relation to sourcing content and influencers who engage with us in relation to a brand), you consent to the collection and use of your Personal Data in accordance with this Statement.

<p>You can tell us not to contact you with information regarding our products and Services, either at the point such information is collected on the Site (by checking or un-checking (as directed) the relevant box), by discontinuing a particular Service or, where you do not wish us to continue to use your information in this way, by following the unsubscribe instructions on any communications sent to you.

<h3 class="h3 is-animated">7. Information sharing</h3>
<p>We may disclose aggregate statistics about visitors to the Site, those who engage with our Services, customers and sales in order to describe our Services to prospective partners, advertisers, sponsors and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include no Personal Data.</p>
<p>If you upload, grant clearance in respect of, sell, licence or otherwise provide content, including video content to Storyful, when we distribute that content to our partners, or where you otherwise engage with our Services, we may disclose your Personal Data to our partners in order for them to independently verify the content you have submitted to us. This disclosure may include your name, Facebook, Twitter or other social media profile information and location and may also include other information you have provided to us, such as your email address and phone number and location of where the content was filmed. At the point at which you submit your content to us, you are required to acknowledge that this disclosure will be made and by continuing to upload your details you continue to agree to such disclosure.</p>
<p>Payment details you provide will be encrypted using secure sockets layer (SSL) technology before they are submitted to us over the Internet. Payments made on the Site are made through our payment gateway provider, Braintree. You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to Braintree which operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorising payment. For more information on Braintree’s privacy and security practices, please visit Braintree’s privacy policy and terms and conditions.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your Personal Data to any of our affiliates, or to our agents or contractors who assist us in providing the Services we offer including those provided through the Site, processing transactions, fulfilling requests for information, receiving and sending communications, updating marketing lists, analysing data, providing support services or in other tasks, from time to time. Our agents and contractors will only use your information to the extent necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.</p>
<p>We require our service providers to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Data, and to ensure that Personal Data is processed only for the provision of services on our behalf and in compliance with applicable law.&nbsp; Service providers are not authorized to use or disclose Personal Data, except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.</p>
<p>We may share your information with News Corp (our ultimate parent company) and any entity who is a News Corp affiliate who may be outside of the EEA for use in accordance with this Statement. A current list of our News Corp affiliated companies is available at&nbsp;<a href="http://newscorp.com/about/our-businesses/">https://newscorp.com/about/our-businesses/</a>.</p>
<p>We may further disclose information about you (1) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (2) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, and (3) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity. We also reserve the right to transfer Personal Data we have about you in the event of a proposed or completed sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).</p>

<h3 class="h3 is-animated">8. Child safety</h3>
<p>Protecting the safety of children when they use the Internet is very important to us. We do not knowingly collect information from minors without seeking parental or guardian consent. We recommend that children receive permission from their parent or guardian before gaining access to our Services or sending Personal Data to us or anyone else online. Where we become aware that content may have been uploaded by a minor, we will contact the uploader to seek further permissions before using the content further. If content provided by you contains children, you must seek parental or guardian consent to share the video with us. When you submit the video, you declare that you have such permissions.</p>

<p>We place great importance on the security of the Personal Data associated with our users. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the Personal Data we have about you against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.&nbsp; We make reasonable efforts to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing, taking into account the costs of implementation and nature of the processing of Personal Data.</p>
<p>You should bear in mind that submission of information over the Internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Site or Services whilst it is in transit over the Internet and any such submission is at your own risk.&nbsp;It is advisable to close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your Personal Data if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.</p>
<p>We retain Personal Data for the period needed to fulfil the purposes for which Personal Data was collected and as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law, such as in relation to our record retention obligations.</p>
<h3 class="&quot;h3">11. Transfer and Storage of your information</h3>
<p>Information that you submit via the Site and/or the Services is sent to and stored on secure servers located in the United States and in the EEA. Information submitted by you may also be transferred by us to our other offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances described above (see Information sharing), which may be situated outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and/or the United States and may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA and/or the United States. The countries concerned may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA or the United States. Where we transfer your information we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.
