						<h2 class="page-post">Our Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We want the StoreBlogs network, community and services to be built on trust and pledge to remain committed to maintaining the privacy of any StoreBlogs member or website user. This website privacy policy (<em>the</em> “<em>Privacy Policy</em>“) is meant to inform you about the practices for gathering, storing and disseminating information collected Online, or through the use of our website (<em>the</em> “<em>Site</em>“) and how we use, or intend to use, that information.</p>
<p>By using the StoreBlogs platform, network, community and services and by accessing the StoreBlogs Site, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you do not agree with the Privacy Policy set forth below, we urge you to refrain from using or accessing the Site, network, community or services. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly consent to the use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information as outlined below. The Privacy Policy may be changed from time to time by us without notice. All changes will be posted to this Privacy Policy and we encourage you to check back here periodically for any policy updates or changes.</p>
<h2 class="page-post">1. Information Collection.</h2>
<p>Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell or disclose information that identifies users of the StoreBlogs network personally or makes it possible for other parties to contact them directly (“<em>Personal Information</em>“). We also collect non-personal information (“<em>Anonymous Information</em>“), such as pages visited, on the StoreBlogs network Site. We may also collect or develop aggregated information, which may include Anonymous Information and Personal Information, provided that such information does not personally identify you or any of our other users (“<em>Aggregated Information</em>“).</p>
<p><strong>a. Voluntarily Information.</strong></p>
<p>When you register to list your blog within the StoreBlogs network, order goods or services from the Site, or register for our newsletter, we will collect and retain information about you, some of which is Personal Information. For example, registration requires you to provide a valid e-mail address, your username, first name, last name, city and country. This e-mail address provided by you in the registration form will only be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Any other information you provide in your user profile will be visible to others, including anonymous visitors to the Site. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply. When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information. We may also collect Personal Information, such as demographic information, from you at other points on the Site that state that Personal Information is being collected.</p>
<p><strong>b. Cookies.</strong></p>
<p>We collect Anonymous Information about you and your use of the StoreBlogs network, community and services whenever you visit us online. This includes use of cookies to store your user session IDs. StoreBlogs uses session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. StoreBlogs does not use cookies to track your web browsing on other websites.</p>
<p><strong>c. Visitor Tracking.</strong></p>
<p>As is true of most websites, StoreBlogs gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Except as noted herein, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>d. IP Addresses.</strong></p>
<p>Each user’s IP address is logged with each visit and each action performed on the Site. This information is never provided to third parties, except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, and is logged only for a temporary period of time. IP address information is linked to Personal Information and may be used in an effort to block a “banned” user from accessing the Site.</p>
<p><strong>e. Advertising.</strong></p>
<p>If there is advertising on the Site, such advertising may employ the use of cookies or other methods to track hits and click-throughs. We are not responsible for advertiser cookies or how the information gathered through their use might be used.</p>
<p><strong>f. Public Websites.</strong></p>
<p>You should be aware that any Personal Information you submit on the Site in blogs, comments, other posts and your member profile can be read, collected, or used by other users of this Site, including anonymous visitors, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the Personal Information you choose to submit or share on this Site or within your member profile.</p>
<p><strong>g. Aggregated Information.</strong></p>
<p>We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all Aggregated Information. When we share such information with other companies, it is not traceable to any particular user, and will not be used to contact you.</p>
<h2 class="page-post">2. Information Use.</h2>
<p><strong>a. Personal Information Use.</strong></p>
<p>In general, Personal Information you submit is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. StoreBlogs may use your Personal Information in the following ways: to facilitate the creation of and secure your account on our blog network; to identify you as a user on our platform or within our system; to provide improved administration of our Site and services; to improve the quality of experience when you interact with our Site; to send you a welcome e-mail to verify ownership of the e-mail address provided when your account was created; to send you administrative e-mail notifications, such as security or support and maintenance advisories; to respond to your inquiries or other requests; to send promotional communications; to provide you with electronic newsletters, or surveys; to send and facilitate upgrades and special offers related to our services and for other marketing purposes, should you request to receive such communications from us. When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive or by contacting us directly. Should you decide to opt-out of receiving future mailings, we may share your e-mail address with third parties to ensure that you do not receive further communications from third parties. Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you notices of any updates to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>b. Anonymous and Aggregated Information Use.</strong></p>

<p><strong>a. Co-branded Services.</strong></p>
<p>At some point, we may share Anonymous or Aggregated Information with certain businesses with which StoreBlogs has formed a strategic alliance. You may be able to identify these businesses because Storeblogs has authorized them to display clearly identified and branded images on the Storeblogs network, community or service pages and in its communications. These strategic partners are requested to clearly state their own privacy policies on their own websites or promotional materials, and if you provide them with your Personal Information, it may become subject to the policies of the respective company. StoreBlogs may receive information from these strategic partners and may add such information to information already collected from you. No Personal Information identifiable to a specific user is collected or shared with these strategic partners from the StoreBlogs network, community or services.</p>
<p><strong>b. Third Party Services.</strong></p>
<p>StoreBlogs reserves the right to offer third party services and products to you on the Site, such as via newsletters or special offers. We may share Aggregated Information about our user base with other entities, such as advertisers. This information does not identify individual users, except where you have given us prior, specific permission to do so. We do not link Aggregated Information with Personal Information. We may share Personal Information with third-party vendors and partners only in those situations where you have given us prior, specific permission to do so.</p>
<p><strong>c. Third Party Contractors.</strong></p>
<p>We may share your Personal Information with third party contractors or service providers to provide you with the services that we offer you though our Site; to conduct quality assurance testing; to facilitate creation of accounts; to provide help or support; or to provide specific services in accordance with your instructions.

Additional Affiliates may be added here in the future. We may share some or all of your Personal Information with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires our company or our assets, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by it and StoreBlogs and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>e. Legal Requirements.</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect or defend our rights, property, or users and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on StoreBlogs.</p>
