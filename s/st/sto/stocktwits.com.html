            <br>
            <p>StockTwits provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from users of this website, located at  <a href="http://www.stocktwits.com">www.StockTwits.com</a> ("Site" ), or collected through our social networking service, including via [SMS, WAP and Instant Messaging] (together with the Site, the "Service" ). This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason; each version will apply to information collected while it was in place. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>By using our Site you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing" means using cookies on a computer or using information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you reside outside the U.S., your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the U.S., and processed and stored there under U.S. privacy standards. By using the Service and providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the U.S. If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our use of your personally identifiable information, please contact us at privacy@stocktwits.com.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
            <p>Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are to provide you with the product and services made available through the Service, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <strong>Information.</strong>
              Your full user name and your image (if you decide to upload one) for which you registered on Twitter.com (“Twitter”) are displayed to people in the StockTwits network to enable you to connect with people on StockTwits, as specified in your privacy settings on Twitter.  If you activate the mobile device options, when available, per the Terms of Use at <a href="http://www.StockTwits.com/terms_of_use">www.StockTwits.com/terms_of_use</a>, we will collect your cellular phone number. If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <strong>Use of Contact Information.</strong>
              In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about, our products and services, including but not limited to our Service.

            <p>
              <strong>Log Data.</strong>
              When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Service, and for the Service’s technical administration. We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except in case of violation of the Terms of Use.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>Like many websites, we also use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. StockTwits may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Service. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Service Providers.</strong>
              We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</strong>
              StockTwits cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of StockTwits or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>

            <br>
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>StockTwits is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.</p>
            <br>
