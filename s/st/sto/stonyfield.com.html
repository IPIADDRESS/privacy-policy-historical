<p><strong>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY</strong></p>
<p>Stonyfield Farm, Inc. ("Stonyfield," "us," "we," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of the users ("user", "you" or "your") of the web sites operated by it (collectively, the "Site") and when you engage with us through social media sites.  Stonyfield's Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us and in making informed decisions when using our Site.  This Privacy Policy will be continuously assessed against new technologies and business practices.  This Privacy Policy applies to the Site and governs data collection and usage at the Site.  The United States has data protection laws that may not be consistent with those of other countries.  By accessing, browsing and/or using the Site, including all content, software, functions, services, materials and information made available on or accessed through the Site, whether you are a "Visitor" (which means that you simply browse the Site) or a "Registered User" (which means that you have registered with Stonyfield), you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.  Any information provided by and through the Site will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  The terms "you", "your" or "user" as used in this Privacy Policy refer to a Visitor or a Registered User.  By using the Site, you consent to the processing of data about you in the manner and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.  Please read this Privacy Policy in its entirety.</p>
<h3>USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
<p>We and our authorized Service Providers (as that term is defined below) employ cookies, clear gifs/web beacons, log files and/or other technologies to store and track information about the users of our Site.  Such information allows us to analyze site usage and user demographics, interests and behavior to better understand our users and improve our Site and user experience.</p>
<p>Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a web site.  Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's web browser on the user's computer hard drive.  Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on a web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related web pages.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser to prevent it from accepting cookies.  If you set your browser to reject cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use some areas and features/functions of the Site may be limited.</p>
<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site.  A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  You can remove persistent cookies by following the directions provided in your Internet browser's "HELP" file.</p>
<p>Login areas on the Site require that your browser accept session ID cookies.  We use session ID cookies to verify that you are properly signed in.</p>
<p>Clear gifs/web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs/web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages.  Clear gifs/web beacons and auditing software are used to track page views and entry and exit points to and from the Site.</p>
<p>Clear gifs/web beacons, cookies, customized links, pixel tags and/or similar technologies are also used to determine whether e-mail sent by us to Registered Users and/or electronic newsletter(s) sent by us to those who have signed up/subscribed to such newsletter(s) have been opened, the recipient's e-mail address, the date and time the e-mail or newsletter was opened and which links are clicked.</p>
<p>Targeting cookies are used when you click on the "Share", "Like", "Facebook" or "Tweet" buttons that may be found on certain web pages of our Site and which are linked to services provided by third parties.  Such third parties subsequently may use information about your visit to target advertising to you on their web sites.  They also may share such information with others, including advertising agencies.  We do not control the setting of these cookies nor the cookie data sent by your browser to the third parties in order to associate the buttons to your accounts with those parties, which data is not accessible to us.  We encourage you to check with the third party web sites concerned for more information about their cookies and how to control them.</p>
<p>We may use clear gifs/web beacons and/or similar technologies to better tailor, manage, place and/or display our own and/or third-parties' advertisements/banner ads and/or content on the Site.  We may use similar technology to tailor, manage, place and/or display advertisements/banner ads that are reflective of a user's interests based on that user's browsing behavior.  These technologies may be in use on a number of web pages across the Site.  When you access these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated, which may be processed by us or by our Service Providers.  These clear gifs/web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies.  If you do not want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to reject cookies.  If you set your browser to reject cookies, gifs/web beacons and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded.</p>
<p>To support our information provision and engagement, we may embed photos and video content from web sites such as YouTube, Vimeo, Flickr and others.  As a result, when you visit a page on our Site with content embedded from, for example, YouTube, you may be presented with cookies from this third party web site. We do not control the dissemination of these cookies.  We encourage you to check with the third party web sites concerned for more information about their cookies and how to control them.</p>
<p>The Site may use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us to analyze how users use the Site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States and/or in other countries.  Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Site, compiling reports on web site activity for us and providing other services relating to web site activity and Internet usage.  Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.  Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.  As set forth above, you may reject cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser.  If you choose to do so, however, you may not be able to use certain areas and features/functions of the Site.  By using this Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.</p>
<h3>TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>
<p>Through the use of cookies, clear gifs/web beacons and other technologies, we and our authorized Service Providers automatically track and collect certain anonymous information about our Site traffic (collectively "Traffic Data") and store it in log files.  Traffic Data includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, domain name, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, advertising/promotional campaign from which the user linked to the Site, operating system and/or platform, date/time stamp, geo-location, number of page views, page or section accesses, ads viewed and interacted with, clickstream data, coupon requests, coupon prints and coupon redemptions. Traffic Data is used by us and/or our Service Providers to track users' engagement and movements around the Site, to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to assist us in designing and arranging our web pages in the user-friendliest manner and to continually improve our Site to better meet the needs of users.  We may place and/or display advertisements/banner ads on the Site that originate from outside advertisers and other third parties.  If you click on and/or view these ads, the advertisers/third parties may assign cookies and automatically track and collect certain anonymous information.  We do not control these cookies, nor are we responsible for any marketing or other use of your information by these outside advertisers or other third parties.</p>
<p>We also may use third-party advertising companies to place and/or display advertisements/banner ads when you visit the Site.  These companies may assign cookies and automatically track, collect and use certain anonymous information about your visits to the Site and other web sites in order to provide advertisements/banner ads about goods and/or services that may be of interest to you.  We do not control these cookies, nor are we responsible for any marketing or other use of your information by these third-party advertising companies.</p>

In addition, if you engage with us through social media web sites or through features on any of the web sites operated by us that integrate with social media sites, you may allow us to have access to certain Personal Information and other information from your social media account (e.g., name, e-mail address, photo, gender, birthday, city, the posts or the 'likes' you make).</p>
<p>You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information.  In such an event, you can still access and use much of the Site.  You, however, will not be able to access or use those areas of the Site or participate in online activities that require your Personal Information.</p>
<p>Participation in online activities at the Site may be subject to additional terms, conditions and notices and such activities shall be governed by such terms, conditions and notices.  In the event of any conflict, such additional or different terms, conditions and notices will prevail over this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>USES AND SHARING OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>

Service Providers of Stonyfield who have access to Personal Information, however, are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and not to use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Stonyfield.</p>
<p>We may use Traffic Data to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
<p>We may provide Traffic Data and/or other aggregate non-personally identifying information to third parties.</p>
<p>If you are a Registered User or sign up/subscribe to our electronic newsletter(s) and you login to the Site or click on a link contained in an e-mail sent by us or in our electronic newsletter(s), we may link Traffic Data to your user name and password and to your Personal Information solely for our own business purposes and use, including to customize and tailor your experience on our Site, to serve and/or display specific advertisements/banner ads and/or content when you visit the Site, and to send you information about us, including information related to our products, services, programs or promotional activities, or about third party products, services, programs or promotional activities, that may be of interest to you based on your usage of and behavior on the Site.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may transfer, sell or assign information concerning the Site and your use of the Site, including without limitation, Personal Information, to third parties, as a result of the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation of Stonyfield.</p>
