This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how Storify uses and collects information, including both the personal information you submit through the Storify website (the “Website”) and the information that the Website automatically collects when you use the Website. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our privacy practices.&nbsp; In addition, please review our Terms of Service, which also govern your use of this Website, and which incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference. By using the Website, you consent that you have read and accept our privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p><h2>Personal Information</h2><p>For some activities on Storify, such as creating, publishing and commenting on stories, you may be required to create an account.

Storify may choose to collect any such personal information.</p><h2>Accessing and Modifying Your Personal Information</h2><p>You can access your personal information by logging in and clicking on “Settings.” From there, you can change the email address associated with your account or delete your account.</p><h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2><p>While Storify generally makes every effort to preserve your privacy and does not sell, transfer or otherwise disseminate your personally identifiable information to outside parties, it reserves the right to do so under certain circumstances:</p><ul><li><b>Third Parties</b>In limited circumstances, Storify may provide personal information to trusted third parties to provide support for the operation of the Website. Personal information will only be disclosed subject to an appropriate confidentiality and security agreement, and only to the extent necessary to perform these support functions.
</li><li><b>Disclosures Required by Law</b>We may disclose your information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or when doing so is reasonably necessary to: comply with a law, regulation or legal process; to respond to any claims; to protect and defend the rights, property or personal safety of any person; to address security or technical issues; or to protect against fraud, misuse or unauthorized use of the Website.

</li></ul><p></p><h2>Facilitating Use of the Website</h2><p>We use cookies, web beacons and log file information to enable users to log into the Website without re-entering password information every time, to provide personalized content, and to monitor metrics such as the total number of page visits.</p><p>Storify may also contract with and/or form partnerships with third parties. Storify’s partners may monitor certain pages of the Website for the purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisement “clickthroughs,” and/or other analytics.

In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, we will delete any information from people we believe to be under 13 and cancel the corresponding accounts. By submitting any personally identifying information, you certify that you are at least 13 years of age.</p><h2>Notification of Changes</h2><p>We may make changes to our Privacy Policy from time to time.
