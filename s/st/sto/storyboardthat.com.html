        <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy (“Policy”) is designed to inform users of the Storyboard That service, including all associated websites (collectively, the “Service”) about how Clever Prototypes, LLC (“Clever Prototypes,” “we” or “us”) gathers and uses personal information collected by us in connection with the Service.  We will take reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this policy and with applicable U.S. laws.  In this policy, “user” or “you” means any person using or otherwise benefiting from the Service or otherwise submitting personal information to Clever Prototypes via the Service.  BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE.</p>

        <h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
    
            <h3>Limited Personal Information: </h3>
        <p>We collect the following personal information in connection with the Service: (a) if you register as a Clever Prototypes user directly, we will collect the personal information you submit to us to build your user profile, including your name, email address, and zip code; (b) if you pay fees by credit card, we may collect the name, expiration date and credit card number for the relevant card; and (c) if you communicate with us by email, we will collect your email address.  All of this information is referred to in this Policy as “Personal Information”.</p>
        
        <h3>Other Personal Identifiers:</h3>
        <p>Apart from the limited personal information described above, Clever Prototypes does not collect and does not wish to receive any personally identifying information.  Without limitation, you shall not submit to Clever Prototypes any social security number, financial account number, credit or debit card number (other than the number of the card paying for the Service), driver’s license number or government ID number.  To the extent schools, parents, guardians, or teachers create accounts for students under 13 years of age, we may collect first and last names and e-mail addresses from those schools, parents, guardians, or teacher for the sole purpose of rendering the Service, and will otherwise take steps to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity thereof.  Children under 13 years of age that use the Service under the supervision of a school, parent, guardian, or teacher are not permitted to provide or upload any personal information.</p>
        
        <h3>User Data:</h3>
        <p>The Service allows all users to create storyboards using data provided by Clever Prototypes and, optionally, data provided by users.  All data uploaded by users is referred to in this Policy as “User Data.”  </p>
        
        <h3>Web Tracking Information:</h3>
        <p>We, and our third party service providers, may use web tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and clear GIFs in order to operate the Service efficiently and to collect data related to usage of the Service.  Such collected data (“Web Tracking Information”) may include the address of the websites you visited before and after you visited the Service, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, what pages in the Service you visit and what links you clicked on, and whether you opened email communications we send to you.  In order to collect Web Tracking Information and to make your use of the Service more efficient, we may store cookies on your computer.  We may also use web tracking technologies that are placed in web pages on the Service or in email communications to collect information about actions that users take when they interact with the Service or such email communications, and Clever Prototypes’ Contractors (as defined herein) may also do so.  We do not correlate Web Tracking Information to individual user Personal Information, except for internal operational, product development, and administrative purposes of the Service.  Some Web Tracking Information may include data, such as IP address data, that is unique to you.  You may be able to modify your browser settings to alter which web tracking technologies are permitted when you use the Service, but this may affect the performance of the Service.</p>

        <h3>Personal Information: </h3>

        <h3>User Data:</h3>
        <p>We collect and stores User Data in order to provide the Service to you, and it may be used for the internal operational, product development, and administrative purposes of the Service  If you create storyboards that incorporate User Data with a Free Account, or if otherwise marked for publication, User Data will be accessible to the public via the Service and via third-party search engines.</p>
        
        <h3>Web Tracking Information: </h3>

        <h3>Aggregate Information:  </h3>
        <p>We will also create statistical, aggregated data relating to our users and the Service for analytical purposes.

<h3>Personal Information and User Data:</h3>
