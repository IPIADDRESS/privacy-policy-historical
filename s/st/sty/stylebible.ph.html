   <p><strong>Style Bible</strong> is defined as all websites, web pages and channels owned, controlled and/or operated by the same group that created Preview Magazine, the country’s best-selling fashion magazine.</p>
<p>
We frequently provide information and links to third-party advertisers or partners. Information on how to access the privacy practices of these third parties is included below as well. </p>
<p>
We will notify our members when we make any significant changes to our Privacy Policy that affect the use of any personally identifiable information we collect. We will not make new use of any personally identifiable information which Style Bible gathered from individual members or visitors prior to any such significant change in our Privacy Policy without first obtaining the member's or visitor's consent for any new uses. In instances where we ask for your personally identifiable information and we tell you the data we are collecting on that page will be shared with unaffiliated third parties, and in cases where a member, visitor or subscriber to Style Bible opts-in to share his/her information with third parties, those disclosures and opt-ins will override anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy. In addition, Style Bible reserves the right to make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that will not affect Style Bible's use of a user's personally identifiable information at any time without any notice to you other than posting any such changes in a revised Privacy Policy on Style Bible. We encourage you to periodically review our Privacy Policy to be sure you are familiar with the most current version. The Policy will include the most recent date in which any revision has been made. Please note that this Privacy Policy is also incorporated into Style Bible's <a href="terms.php" class="terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<h3>Information that Style Bible collects </h3>

<h4>Style Bible gathers two basic types of information:</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Information provided to</strong> Style Bible 

In order to use many of Style Bible's features, tools and services, we ask you to register to become a member. During this member registration process, we will ask for your personally identifiable information such as your name, mobile/phone number, email address, mailing address, zip code, country, gender, birth date, age, member name and password. In addition, you may choose to provide Style Bible with additional information including marital status, household income, education, and employment status. 

Style Bible uses the information it gathers for several purposes, such as to understand more about our audience's interests, to communicate with you and to give you a better experience when visiting Style Bible by personalizing tools, content, services and email messages (more details below). Style Bible also uses this information to build new services and develop offers that Style Bible believes are more relevant and valuable to you. 

Style Bible, its advertisers and partners may ask you for information in order to provide you with access to goods, services and tools. When personally identifiable information provided by you is (i) collected by Style Bible and/or a Style Bible sponsor or partner or (ii) collected by Style Bible and shared with a Style Bible sponsor or partner, your permission will be obtained and you will be advised as to which privacy policy(ies) will control the collection and dissemination of the information provided if different from Style Bible's policy. 
</li>
<li><strong>Information gathered by</strong> Style Bible 

When you visit Style Bible and interact with the services and tools that reside there, Style Bible and third parties with whom Style Bible has contracted to provide services to Style Bible may collect information on your actions. This type of information is generally collected from two sources, one is from the server log files and the other is from cookies. 

<h4>How information is collected and disseminated</h4> 

The information collected by Style Bible is used to create aggregated portraits of the Style Bible audience, portraits which present anonymous statistical demographic information but no personally identifiable information. This aggregated information is used, among other things, to determine trends and needs, and also to supply market research to potential advertisers and partners to help them understand who the Style Bible audience is. For example, we may create a report that tells advertisers that 60 percent of our members are females in a certain age range, so that they can determine which of their products or services are most appropriate for our members. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to better describe how information is collected and disseminated, please carefully review the list below. </p>

<ul>
<li>Membership Registration </li>
<li>Order Forms and Transactions with E-Commerce Partners And Advertisers </li>
<li>Public Forums</li>
<li>Surveys and Polls </li>
<li>Contests and promos</li>
<li>“Email this Page” services</li>
<li>Links to Partner and Advertiser Sites</li>
<li>Information collected by Style Bible through IP address and cookies </li>

</ul>

<h4>Membership registration</h4>
<p>
Many areas of Style Bible are reserved for Style Bible members who have registered with us; for example, forums, sending in questions to <strong>Personal Stylist</strong>, voting for <strong>Style Stars</strong>, shopping at <strong>The Mall</strong>, subscribing to the magazine and access to special offers and promos. This is necessary so that Style Bible can assure the quality of its forums. Registration is free. 
</p>
<p>
The membership registration form currently requires you to choose a member name and password and provide Style Bible with your first and last names, email address, mailing address, zip code, country, gender, age and birth date. The form also includes optional information that you may choose to provide to us like marital status, household income, education and employment status. 
</p>
<p>
The personally identifiable information you provide during membership registration will not be given to unaffiliated third parties without your consent except in the limited circumstances described in the section of this Privacy Policy entitled "Information Sharing Policy". 
</p>
<p>
Order forms and transactions with e-commerce partners and advertisers 
</p>

<p>
The information provided via order forms is generally shared with advertisers and partners on an aggregated basis. In the event that an advertiser or partner wishes to offer free samples, or provide information about products and services and to do so requires personally identifiable information, Style Bible will provide you with the ability to "opt-in" and will often provide you access to the Privacy Policy of the advertiser for your review via a link. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "opt-in" is generally defined as any affirmative action by a Style Bible member or visitor to submit or receive information, as the case may be. When you provide personal, financial, and other personally identifiable information to one of Style Bible's e-commerce partners, this transaction will occur on the e-commerce partner's site, not Style Bible and as such the financial and personally identifiable information you provide is collected by and controlled by the Privacy Policy of that e-commerce partner. It is important therefore that you familiarize yourself with the Privacy Policy of the e-commerce site with which you transact business. 
</p>


<h4>Public forums </h4>

Throughout Style Bible, various public forums and an "ask the expert" section called Personal Stylist are available to you as a registered member of Style Bible. Please remember that any information you disclose in these public forum areas becomes public information and is immediately accessible to Style Bible, so it is important for you to exercise discretion and appropriate caution when deciding to reveal personal information and/or issuing your comments, feedback, and suggestions regarding a certain story or topic, or even photos. Style Bible may decide to utilize the content of forums and interactions with experts throughout Style Bible and in promotions in order to enhance Style Bible's editorial, advertising, promotional and similar activities. In those cases we often provide authorship credit by listing the author's member name. We therefore encourage you to use care in protecting your identity when you choose a member name and to keep your member name confidential. 
<p></p>


<h4>Contests and other promos</h4> 


<p>
We regularly operate contests and other promos throughout Style Bible. We typically ask you for your email address and mobile/phone number (to notify you if you've won, or not). We also ask for first and last names, and sometimes post office addresses in order to verify the entrant's identity. In some situations, we need additional information as part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice. This information is shared with an unaffiliated third party: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>When you choose to receive information from a third party promo sponsor;</li>
<li>When a contest or promo is hosted by Style Bible but administered by a sponsor, again, we will advise you of this in the contest or promo rules; or</li>
<li>Most contests and other promos will also ask you to consent to the release of information contained within the entry form for tax purposes if you become a winner.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You should carefully review the rules of each contest and promo which you enter as they may contain additional important information about Style Bible's or a sponsor's use of your personally identifiable information. 
</p>


<h4>“Email this Page” service </h4>


<p>
Style Bible offers the ability to forward an article to another person via email. If you use either of these services, we will use the recipient's email address in order to send the article or postcard and we will also ask for your email address. We do not use the recipient's email address for any other purpose unless such recipient gives us permission to do so. 
</p>


<h4>Links to partner and advertiser sites </h4>


<p>
Style Bible contains links to advertiser and partner websites. We cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such non-Style Bible websites, and we do not control the practices of any of our advertisers or partners to whom we are linked. However, we generally will advise you when you are leaving Style Bible through a link, and when that advertiser's or partner's Privacy Policy controls the collection and dissemination of the information you provide. 
</p>

<p>
In order to participate in the partner and/or advertiser supplied services and tools you may be required to provide personally identifiable information to the advertisers and partners whose tools and services you have chosen to interact with. Each advertiser and partner will request different information from you. 
</p>

<p>
In any instance where personally identifiable information is required to be provided to or shared with Style Bible advertisers and partners, Style Bible generally will advise you when such advertiser or partner will receive your personally identifiable information, and further advise you as to which Privacy Policy will control the collection and dissemination of personally identifiable information you provide. Style Bible will use commercially reasonable efforts to contractually require all such third party advertisers and partners to agree to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy. 
</p>

<p>
The information you provide via links to co-branded pages, co-branded sites, third party sites or tools may be shared with advertisers and partners on an aggregated basis and in these instances your permission will not be requested since no personally identifiable information will be shared or provided to these third party sponsors or advertisers. Style Bible will, however, use commercially reasonable efforts to contractually require all such third party advertisers and partners to agree not to use any non-personally identifiable information about you, in conjunction with other sources of information, or otherwise, to identify you. 
</p>

<p>
If you have additional questions about how one of our advertisers, partners, or sponsors use information about you, we urge you to contact them directly. 
</p>


<h4>Information sharing policy </h4>


<p>
Style Bible does not sell or otherwise share personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties without your consent except in the following instances: (i) unless required by applicable law or pursuant to a court or similar order; (ii) as deemed necessary, in Style Bible's discretion, to protect the legal rights or the property of Style Bible, a member or third party, or to prevent personal injury; and/or (iii) in the event Style Bible is required to transfer personally identifiable information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger, assignment, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of the assets or stock of Style Bible or its affiliated entities (including, without limitation, in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). In addition, Style Bible reserves the right to allow access to its systems to third parties providing necessary technical services when such access is required in order to provide those services and to provide your personally identifiable information to third parties who provide services on behalf of Style Bible, provided that such third parties are bound by Style Bible's Privacy Policy. Please note, however, that Style Bible reserves the right to share any personally identifiable or other information about you which you provide to (or which is gathered by) Style Bible with any or all of its subsidiaries and affiliates, and will also have access to any such information which you provide to (or which is gathered by) the web sites of any of our Affiliates. 
</p>

<h4>Style Bible opt-in/opt-out policy </h4>


<p>
Upon registration or from time-to-time, you may be asked to indicate whether you are interested in receiving information from us about special offers or news about our sites and advertisers. You will also be provided with the opportunity to opt-in to receive offers directly from select companies other than Style Bible. If you do choose to receive these communications by means of an opt-in, we will occasionally send you an email message that matches your request(s). You may, of course, always choose not to receive any of this information from us. We currently provide the following opt-out opportunities: 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Upon registration, you can choose to receive no communications from us other than an initial member welcome message. </li>
    <li>At any time, you can follow a link provided in every newsletter or email message (except for e-commerce confirmation emails) to unsubscribe from that mailing list or email service.</li>
    <li>At any time, you can contact us by email to have your contact preference changed to "Do Not Contact Me."</li>
</ul>	 

<p>
Please note that Style Bible reserves the right to contact you in the event of a change in the Style Bible Terms of Service and/or this Privacy Policy. 
</p>

<p>
At any time, you can opt out of having your personally identifiable information shared with our Affiliates for their direct marketing purposes. 
</p>


<h4>Change/modify/archive information </h4>


<p>
Style Bible provides you with the ability to access, correct or change certain information in your member portrait at any time, including contact information or other information you've provided to us. However, you cannot currently change your member name although you may re-register and choose a new name. Please be advised that Style Bible currently archives information it collects on its members and visitors. 
</p>


<h4>How we protect and secure your information </h4>


<p>
Style Bible has numerous security measures in place to protect you from the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control, including your credit card information if you choose to conduct an e-commerce transaction on Style Bible. All of your member information require use of your password. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone. 
</p>

<p>
Style Bible uses industry-standard tools, such as firewalls, to ensure that your information is secure and confidential. 
</p>


<h4>Guidelines regarding children </h4>


<p>
Personal information about children is a concern for all of us. At Style Bible, we take the protection of children's privacy very seriously. Style Bible does not encourage participation or visitation by children. Visitors who are known to be under the age of 13 are prohibited from becoming a member. Anyone between the ages of 13 and 17 must get special permission from their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) before making any purchases at The Mall, or subscriptions to the magazine.
