		<h2>Information Obtained from Third Parties</h2>

		<p>If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.</p>

		<p>You can import contacts from your Outlook or other email account address book to invite them to become members of our site. We collect the username and password for the email account you wish to import your contacts from and will only use it for that purpose.</p>

			<li> as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process</li>

		<h2>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>

		<p>We may use cookies, for example, to keep track of your preferences and profile information. Cookies are also used to collect general usage and volume statistical information that does not include personal information.</p>

		<h2>Web beacons</h2>

		<p>Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.</p>
		<p>We use a third party to gather information about how you and others use our Web site. For example, we will know how many users access a specific page and which links they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our site is used.</p>

		<h2>Targeted Advertising</h2>

		<p>Targeted Advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising) uses information collected on an individual's web browsing behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made.  Third parties collect this information by placing or accessing cookies in your browser when you visit this, or other, websites.  If you would like to learn more about the third party advertisers that may be aware of the fact that you visit this website, and to understand your choices about having such advertisers' cookies turned off, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>

		<h2>Security</h2>

		<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

		<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

		<p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at customercare@stylemint.com</p>

		<h2>Additional Policy Information</h2>

		<p>You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider.
