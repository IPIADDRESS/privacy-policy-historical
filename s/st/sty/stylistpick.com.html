<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you. Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track your movements around the internet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Site if you do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">We use any of the system-related information referred to above, including cookies, to:</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"> administer the Site and assist in diagnosing technical problems;</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"> identify new and return visitors to the Site;</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"> estimate our audience size and patterns; </span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"> carry out research on our users' demographics;</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"> audit the accessing of resources and downloading of data from the Site; </span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"> assist in improving and updating the Site; </span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"> assist in improving and developing our products and services.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: x-small; ">Information sharing</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">We may disclose aggregate statistics about visitors to the Site, customers and sales in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, sponsors and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">We may disclose your personal information to any of our affiliates, or to our agents or contractors who assist us in providing the products and services we offer through the Site, processing transactions, fulfilling requests for information, receiving and sending communications, updating marketing lists, analysing data, providing support services or in other tasks, from time to time.

<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to prevent fraud or cyber crime or to protect the Site or the rights, property or personal safety of any person.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: x-small; ">Public forums</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Site may, from time to time, make chat rooms, message boards, news groups and/or other public forums available to its users. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when using these and never disclose your personal information.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: x-small; ">External links</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Payments made on the Site are made through our payment service provider. You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to our payment service provider which operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorising payment.

<h3><span style="font-size: x-small; ">Security</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">We place great importance on the security of all personally identifiable information associated with our users. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control. For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorised personnel have access to personal information. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">You should bear in mind that submission of information over the internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Site whilst it is in transit over the internet and any such submission is at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It is advisable to close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your personal information if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: x-small; ">Storage of your information</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Information that you submit via the Site is sent to and stored on secure servers operated by or on behalf of our hosting provider.

Where we transfer your information we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected. By submitting information via the Site, you agree to this storing, processing and/or transfer.</span></p>
