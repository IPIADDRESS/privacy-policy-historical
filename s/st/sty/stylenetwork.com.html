<p><strong>Automatic Information:</strong> E! receives and stores certain types of information automatically whenever you interact with the Website. Here are the types of automatic information E! gathers and how it is used:</p>

<p class="privacy"><strong>IP Address:</strong> Your Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a unique identifier used to connect your computer to the Internet. Your IP address also is stored in E!'s user registration databases when you register with E!</p>
    <p>IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including to:<br>
    </p><ul>
    <li>Help E! identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information </li>
    <li>Diagnose service or technology problems reported by E! users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific Web company or ISP</li>

    <li>Help determine which users have access privileges to certain content that E! hosts.</li>
    </ul><p></p>

    <p><strong>Cookies:</strong> E! uses a feature of your Internet Web browser called a "cookie," a small piece of information stored on your hard drive that uniquely identifies your intra- and inter-requests on the Website. Cookies may be used for various purposes, including to keep track of preferences you specify while you are using E!'s services and the Website.  If you wish to disable the use of cookies, please review the Help section of your Internet browser for instructions.</p>

    <p><strong>Web Beacons:</strong> Web pages may contain electronic images (called a "single-pixel GIF" or "Web beacon") that allow a Website to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies. E! uses Web beacons in the following ways:<br>
    </p><ul>
    <li>Within the E! network of Websites in order to count users and to recognize users by accessing E! cookies</li>
    <li>To count and recognize users who have read emails sent by E!</li>
    <li>To personalize your experience when you visit the Website</li>
    </ul><p></p>

    <p><strong>Mobile Device Unique Identifier:</strong> E! provides services that allow users to access and customize Internet content through mobile phones, PDAs and other alternative devices. These devices may collect different information than what is collected by computers.<br>
    </p><ul>
    <li>When connecting to E! using a mobile device that provides Internet access, if the mobile device service provider uniquely identifies the device, E! will receive this information.</li>
    <li>E! may use this unique mobile device identification information to offer extended services and/or functionality.</li>
    <li>Certain E! services may require collection of the phone number for your device. E! may associate that phone number to the mobile device identification information.</li>
    </ul><p></p>

    <p><strong>Physical Location</strong>
    </p><ul>
		<li>Some mobile phone service providers in the United States are required to operate a system that will pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service. </li>
		<li>Depending on the provider and if you are located in the United States, E! may automatically receive this information. </li>
		<li>E! may use and store this information to provide enhanced location-based services as well as to serve location-targeted advertising. </li>
	</ul>
    <p></p>

<p><strong>Personal Information:</strong> E! also receives and stores information that personally identifies you.

You voluntarily provide this personally identifiable information when you enter it on the Website to sign up as a member of E!, whether in connection with a newsletter subscription, when you enter a sweepstakes, promotion or contest and/or other special benefits.</p>
   
<p>At the Website, you can submit personally identifiable information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and email address to send an electronic greeting card or to email an E! news story and, if you are located in the United States, order a gift on the Website and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address.

<p>If you are located in the United States and make a purchase on the Website, E! will collect and store your personally identifiable information. When processing an order on the Website, E! needs to know your name, mailing address, billing address, email address, telephone number, product selection, order number, credit card number and expiration date. This information is necessary to process your order and to keep you updated on your shipping status. Although E! transmits your credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing, E! does not rent, transfer, sell or share your credit card issuer, credit card number or expiration date with any nonaffiliated entities.</p>

<p>Registered Website members, users who sign up for E! newsletters and users who enter sweepstakes or contests on the Website will receive occasional marketing materials or surveys from E! and/or its trusted marketing partners at the email address provided at sign up.

  <p><strong>Use of Third Parties to Collect Information:</strong> E! may use a third party (such as Nielsen-NetRatings) to collect information on the Website for market research purposes, including through the use of cookies and web beacons.  In addition, E! allows other companies that are presenting advertisements on some of E!'s Website pages to set and access cookies on your computer. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.  E! does not control cookies from third-party advertisers. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies and not the Privacy Policy of E!.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Does E! Ever Share Information with Other Parties?</strong></p>

<p>E! may disclose information about you to those whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy in the following circumstances including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>E! may provide personal information provided when you register or when you sign up for a newsletter, sweepstakes or contest to trusted partners who work with E!.

By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.</p>

<p><strong>Links to Outside Third Parties:</strong> E! may establish relationships with business partners by creating a link between their sites and the Website. E! is not, however, responsible for the content, maintenance or privacy policies of those sites. Once you click over to a third party site, E! encourages you to check its privacy policy.</p>

<p>The Website may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than the information practices of E! Users who click over to a third party site from a link on the Website must be aware that E! makes no warranties with regard to that site's policies or business practices. E! is not responsible for any transactions that occur between the user and the third party site. Please consult the other sites' privacy policies, as E! has no control over information that is submitted to or collected by these third parties.

E! encourages parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet use. Also, E! strongly encourages parents to help E! enforce its Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information on the Website without permission.</p>

<p>It is possible that due to fraud or deception by others, E! may unknowingly receive information pertaining to children under the age of 13. If E! is notified of this, once E! has verified the information, E! will promptly obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information from its servers. If you want to notify E! of its receipt of information in relation to children under the age of 13, please email <a href="mailto:CustomerSupportEonline@comcastnets.com">CustomerSupportEonline@comcastnets.com</a>.</p>
