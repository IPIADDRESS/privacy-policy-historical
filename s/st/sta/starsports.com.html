<p><strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</strong> </p>
<p>Star cooperates with mandated government and law enforcement agencies or to any third parties by an order under law for the time being in force to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about You to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process, to protect the property and rights of Star or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

<p><strong>Security</strong> </p>
<p>Star uses ordinary industry standard technology designed to help keep your Personal Information safe. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information You put in before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information, We will employ commercially reasonable and practicable security practices and procedures and security methods and technologies. We will also ensure on reasonable commercial efforts basis that any agent or third party that we employ complies with the same security standards as us for the protection of your Personal Information. </p>
<p>Your information may be transferred to or be maintained on computers, computer systems and computer resources located outside of your state or country where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those where you live.

Your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure.

Once We have received your information, We have commercially reasonable procedures and security features in place to reasonably endeavor to prevent unauthorized access. </p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Sites / Financial Data</strong> </p>
<p>We provide links to other websites for your convenience and information. These sites may have their own privacy policies in place, which we recommend You review if You visit any linked websites. We are not responsible for the content of linked sites or any use of the sites. </p>
<p>While transacting with other users of the Website/App, You may provide your financial information including without limitation your bank account details, credit card account details or your details pertaining to any payment settlement or pre-paid instrument service provider. You understand, agree and acknowledge that the Website/App and Star never receives Your financial and payment information from these service providers.
