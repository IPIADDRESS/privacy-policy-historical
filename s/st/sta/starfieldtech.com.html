<p class="title">I. What information is collected?</p>

<p><strong>Personal Information:</strong><br>
In order to make suggestions or request product or partnership information, we require personal information from you, including your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. If you are enrolling for a Starfield SSL Certificate, we will use your personal information for authenticating your identify in order to create and issue to you a Certificate, and to provide the accompanying Certificate Service.

Our site does not use cookies, unless you are enrolling for one of our Starfield SSL Certificates, and then only for the limited purpose of establishing that you have been authenticated. It is a temporary cookie and does not include any personally identifiable information. The information is erased when you close your browser window. If you refuse to accept the cookie, you will not be able to apply for an SSL Certificate.</p>

<p class="title">II. How information will be used.</p>

<p><strong>Resale and Disclosure of Information:</strong><br>

We do not rent our mailing list to third parties.</strong> Our site uses forms in which you give us contact information (like your name, address, and e-mail address) so you can place orders, request information and support, and make product suggestions. We use your customer information only when it will be important for us to contact you regarding necessary correspondence regarding your product or service, functionality changes to our products, our Web site, new Starfield Technologies services, renewals, and special offers we think you'll find valuable.

</p><p><strong>Information from Starfield SSL Certificates:</strong><br>
If you are applying for a Starfield SSL Certificate, we may need to compare the information in your Certificate application with information from third-party sources in order to authenticate your identity as part of the Certificate Service. We also have partners that assist us in certificate authentication that we may share your information with. Your personal information is protected by these third parties through confidentiality agreements we have with them. If those third parties have subcontractors or affiliates assisting them, they are required to enter into confidentiality agreements with them, and their actions are strictly limited to authenticating your identity.</p>

<p>The information you provide for the content of a Certificate will be "published" in the Certificate where it can be seen by third parties. The content of a Certificate generally includes your e-mail address and name, and may also include other information such as your public key, the expiration date of the public key, the name of Starfield as the Certificate Authority, the serial number of the digital ID, and the digital signature of Starfield.</p>
