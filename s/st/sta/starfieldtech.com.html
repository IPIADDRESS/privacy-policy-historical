			Information Collection and Use 
		</p>
		
		<p> 
			Our Web site uses forms in which you give us contact information (including your name, address, 
			telephone number, and email address) so you can place orders, request information and support, 
			and make product suggestions. For certain services, we may also request a credit card number, 
			social security number or tax identification number, or other financial information. We will then 
			create an account number for you. 
		</p>
		
		<p> 
			We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way, including through email, 
			telephone, or other communications with our customer service department. If you contact us for support, we will keep an internal record of what support 
			was given. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We use your information to contact you regarding functionality changes to our products, 
			our Web site, new Starfield Technologies services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather 
			not receive this information, please see the "Updating Your Information" section below on how to change your 
			preferences. 
		</p>
		
		<p> 
			We may also use your information to present a co-branded offer with our partners or affiliates. 
			If we collect information from you in connection with a co-branded offer, it will be clear at the point of collection 
			who is collecting the information and whose privacy statement applies. 
		</p>
		
		<p> 
			We use information gathered about you 
			from our site statistics (for example your IP address) to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our 
			Web site. We also gather broad demographic information from this data to help us improve our site and make your browsing 
			and purchasing experience more enjoyable. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information, except as necessary 
			to prevent fraud or abuse on our system. 
		</p> 
		
		<p>
			Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and receipts. We use cookies to identify you so you don't 
			need to login each time you visit our site. They are linked to your customer number which is associated with the information in your account. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This site also contains links to other Web sites. Unfortunately, Starfield Technologies is not responsible for the privacy 
			practices or the content of such sites.

		<!--<p class="title"> 
			For Starfield Technologies Marketplace Customers Only 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			When you purchase goods through Starfield Technologies Marketplace, you are granting Starfield Technologies express permission to share 
			your name and contact information (as well as the â€œship toâ€ name and contact information, if different) with 
			the merchant from which you make the purchase, for the purposes of shipping and order fulfillment only. By 
			making a purchase from a merchant, you are not granting that merchant consent to use your information for 
			marketing or any other purposes unless you specifically â€œopt inâ€ to do so. Starfield Technologies has agreements with 
			the merchants on Starfield Technologies Marketplace requiring them to maintain the privacy of your information; however, 
			Starfield Technologies is not responsible for improper use by merchants of your information.

			When you create a storefront to offer goods for sale through Starfield Technologies Marketplace, you will be prompted 
			to enter information about your business, including business name, e-mail address and telephone number 
			(all mandatory), and address, fax number and business hours (all optional). The business information that 
			you enter will be publicly displayed on your storefront page, and will be included in confirmation e-mails 
			sent to people who make purchases from you.

		<p>
			The information you send to us may be stored and used to improve this site and our products, or it may be reviewed and discarded. 
		</p> 
		
		<p class="title">
			Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement
		</p>
		<p>
			We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. 
			We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in 
			our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation 
			subpoenas), to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the 
			public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical. We will also share your 
			information to the extent necessary to comply with ICANN's rules, regulations and policies. 
		</p> 
	
		<p class="title">
			Third Party Service Providers 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We may at times provide information about you to third parties to provide various services on our behalf, such as 
			processing credit card payments, serving advertisements, conducting contests or surveys, performing analyses of our 
			products or customer demographics, shipping of goods or services, and customer relationship management. We will 
			only share information about you that is necessary for the third party to provide the requested service. These 
			companies are prohibited from retaining, sharing, storing or using your personally identifiable information for 
			any secondary purposes. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In the event that we use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf, these companies may employ 
			cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gift or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. 
			Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would 
			like more information about this practice and your choices, click 
			<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" temp_href"http:="" www.networkadvertising.org="" managing="" opt_out.asp"target="_blank"> here. </a> 
		</p> 
		
		<p class="title">
			Supplementation of Information
		</p> 
		
		<p>
			In order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submit to us with 
			information from third party sources ( <i> e.g., </i> information from our strategic partners, service providers, or 
			the United States Postal Service). We do this to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our products and services 
			to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="title">
			Contests/Surveys
		</p>
		
		<p>
			From time-to-time, we may provide you with the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys. If you choose to participate, 
			we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these contests or surveys is completely 
			voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose the requested information. The requested information 
			typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age 
			level - note that you must be 18 or above to enter). We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, 
			to monitor site traffic, and to personalize our site. </p> <p> We may use a third party service provider to conduct these 
			surveys or contests. When we do, that company will be prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information 
			for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with 
			other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice. 
		</p>
		
        
		<p class="title">
			Tell-A-Friend
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask the user for the friend's 
			name and email address. Starfield Technologies will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit our Web 
			site. Starfield Technologies stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact 
			Starfield Technologies at <a href="mailto:support@starfieldtech.com"> support@starfieldtech.com </a> to request the removal of this information from our database. 
		</p>
 

		<p class="title"> 
			What Happens to my Personal Information if I Terminate my Starfield Technologies Account? 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			When your Starfield Technologies account is cancelled (either voluntarily or involuntarily) all of your personally identifiable 
			information is placed in "deactivated" status on our relevant Starfield Technologies databases. However, you should know that 
			deactivation of your account does not mean your personally identifiable information has been deleted from our 
			database entirely. We will retain and use your personally identifiable information if necessary in order to comply 
			with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. <br> 
		</p>
		
		<p class="title">
			Changes in Our Practices
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, 
			we will post those changes to this privacy statement, our home page, and other places we deem appropriate, 
			so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, 
			if any, we disclose it. 
		</p> 
		
		<p>
			If we make material changes to this Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home 
			page, at least 30 days prior to the implementation of the changes. 
		</p>
