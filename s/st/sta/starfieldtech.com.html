			Our site uses forms in which you give us contact information (your name, address, daytime telephone number,

			We will then create an account number for you and if you choose to order from us using a credit card, we will

			record of what support was given. We use your customer information only when it will be important for us to

			services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, 
			please see the "Updating Your Information" section below on how to change your preferences. If we present a

			We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies 
			and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any 
			information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would

			On rare occasions, one of our partners may require us to share your personal information with them. 
			We will only do so with your explicit permission first. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We use information gathered about you from our site statistics (for example your IP address) to help diagnose problems 
			with our server, and to administer our Web site. We also gather broad demographic information from this data to help us 
			improve our site and make your browsing and purchasing experience more enjoyable. This is not linked to any personally 
			identifiable information, except as necessary to prevent fraud or abuse on our system.

		<p>
			Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and receipts. We use <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/secure.asp">cookies</a>

			This site also contains links to other sites. Unfortunately Starfield Technologies is not responsible for the privacy 
			practices or the content of such Web sites.

			We also provide email links, as on our "<a href="http://starfieldtech.com/contact/">About Starfield Technologies</a>" 
			page, to allow you to contact us directly. We strive to promptly reply to your messages.

			Only If We Have To 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			As stated previously in this policy, we will not share your personal information except with a third party to assist 
			us in the processing or securing of your personal information or when we are required by law unless we have given you 
			notice and choice, in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the 
			law, or we must comply with a legal process served on our web site. We will share your information in order to 
			comply with ICANN's rules, regulations and policies. We may also need to give out your information if one of our 
			partners requires it, but these situations are rare. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="title">
			Changes in Our Practices
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If we make material changes to our information handling practices or other privacy aspects, we will post those changes 
			on this privacy statement, at least 30 days prior to their implementation or notify you directly via email. Minor changes 
			will be immediately effective upon reposting to this privacy policy on the Starfield Technologies Software Web site.
		</p>
		
		<p class="title">
			Service Provider
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, 
			store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="title">
			Contest 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or 
			contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. 
			Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information 
			(such as zip code, age level â€“ you must be 18 or above to enter). Contact information will be used to notify the winners 
			and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="title">
			Tell-A-Friend 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's 
			name and email address. Starfield Technologies will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to 
			visit the site. Starfield Technologies stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. 
			The friend may contact Starfield Technologies at <a href="mailto:support@starfieldtech.com">support@starfieldtech.com</a> to request the removal of this information 
			from our database. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="title">
			What Happens to my Personal Information if I Terminate my Starfield Technologies Account?
		</p>
		<p>
			When Your Starfield Technologies account is cancelled (either voluntarily or involuntarily) all of your personally 
			identifiable information is placed in "deactivated" status on our relevant Starfield Technologies databases. 
			However, you should know that deactivation of your account does not mean your personally identifiable information 
			has been deleted from our database entirely. We will retain and use your personally identifiable information if 
			necessary in order to resolve disputes or enforce our agreements.
