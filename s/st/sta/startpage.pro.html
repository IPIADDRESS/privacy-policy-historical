These third   party sites   have separate and independent privacy policies. We   therefore have no   responsibility or liability for the content and   activities of these   linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the   integrity of our site   and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>
                  <p>Google</p>
                  <p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by     Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a     positive experience for users.     https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en</p>
                  <p>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</p>
                  <p>Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve   ads   on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve   ads to   our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on   the   Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by   visiting   the Google ad and content network privacy policy.</p>

                    • Google Display Network Impression Reporting<br>

                  <p>California Online Privacy Protection Act</p>
                  <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require     commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The     law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or     company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates     websites collecting personally identifiable information from   California   consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its   website stating   exactly the information being collected and those   individuals with whom   it is being shared, and to comply with this   policy. - See more at:     http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>
                  <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:<br>
                    Users can visit our site anonymously<br>
                    Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link   to   it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page   after   entering our website.<br>
                    Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</p>
                  <p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:<br>
                    • On our Privacy Policy Page<br>
                    Users are able to change their personal information:<br>
                    • By emailing us<br>
                    • By logging in to their account</p>
                  <p>How does our site handle do not track signals?<br>
                    We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant     cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism     is in place.</p>
                  <p>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?<br>
                    It's also important to note that we allow third party behavioral tracking</p>
                  <p>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</p>
                  <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information     from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act     (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the     nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which     spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to     protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>
                  <p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>
                  <p>Fair Information Practices</p>
                  <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the   backbone   of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they   include have   played a significant role in the development of data   protection laws   around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information   Practice Principles   and how they should be implemented is critical to   comply with the   various privacy laws that protect personal   information.</p>
                  <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:<br>
                    We will notify the users via email<br>
                    • Within 7 business days<br>
                    We will notify the users via in site notification<br>
                    • Within 7 business days</p>
                  <p>We also agree to the individual redress principle,   which   requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally   enforceable   rights against data collectors and processors who fail to   adhere to the   law. This principle requires not only that individuals   have enforceable   rights against data users, but also that individuals   have recourse to   courts or a government agency to investigate and/or   prosecute   non-compliance by data processors.</p>
                  <p>CAN SPAM Act</p>
                  <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for     commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages,     gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to     them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
                  <p>We collect your email address in order to:<br>
                    • Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</p>
                  <p>To be accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:<br>
                    • NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses<br>
                    • Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way<br>
                    • Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters<br>
                    • Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.<br>
                    • Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly<br>
                    • Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email</p>
                  <p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can<br>
                    • Follow the instructions at the bottom of each email.</p>
