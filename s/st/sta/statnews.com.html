While no security is impenetrable, we implement and maintain commercially appropriate technical, physical, administrative and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk for our use of the Personal Data, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing. For Personal Information of EU/EEA and UK residents, we also take into account the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. We maintain, monitor, test, and upgrade information security policies, practices, and systems to assist in protecting the Personal Information that we knowingly collect from you, and to maintain the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of our systems and services. Boston Globe personnel receive training, as applicable, to effectively implement our privacy policies. We also employ access restrictions, limiting the scope of employees who have access to Personal Information and are subject to a duty of confidentiality. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information and/or Personal Information.</p>
<p>The Boston Globe has implemented physical and technical safeguards, online and offline, to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alternation, or destruction. Despite these precautions, no data security safeguards guarantee 100% security all of the time. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal information breach and will notify you and/or any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.<a name="privacy_no7"></a></p>

<li><strong>Minimization, Retention, And Deletion Of Personal Information</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including, for example, for so long as we provide you with Services, and for the purposes of satisfying any legal (including but not limited to enforcement of agreements or resolving disputes), accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request Erasure below for further information. At your request, when we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you Services, contact <a href="mailto:support@bostonglobe.com">support@bostonglobe.com</a>.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.<a name="privacy_no8"></a></p>

<li><strong>EU/EEA And UK Specific Clauses</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>Lawful Basis for Processing (EU/EEA; UK)</u></strong></p>
<p>Regardless of your jurisdiction, we will only use your Personal Information when the law allows us to. That said, if you are a resident of the EU/EEA or the United Kingdom, our lawful basis for collecting and using your Personal Information will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. Generally we will not collect or access any Personal Information other than under the following circumstances:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>
<li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
<li>Where we need to comply with a legal, regulatory, or self-regulatory obligation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We may also collect or access Personal Information with your consent.</p>
<p>What we mean by legitimate interests is the interest of our business in conducting, managing, and growing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your Personal Information for our legitimate interests. For example, Personal Information which may be necessary for the daily operation of the Boston Globe’s services, handling our readers’ inquiries, direct marketing of products and services, completing transactions, making disclosures under the requirements of any applicable law, and the provision of our services and products to our subscribers and prospective subscribers (and which may be further described in Section III above). Without such information, the Boston Globe may be unable to provide its services and products to you, our readers, subscribers, and prospective subscribers or readers. We do not use your Personal Information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</p>
<p>Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your information. Please contact us if you need additional details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data.</p>
<p>Where we rely upon your consent to process the Personal Information, you have the right to withdraw or decline your consent at any time. Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your Personal Information other than in relation to sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email. You may withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us at info@statnews.com, <a class="bgmp-gdpr-reconfirm" href="#">withdrawing your consent</a> for the placement of certain cookies, or by clicking the unsubscribe link in the marketing email. Please note that this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>
<p>We recognize and respect that your privacy and Personal Information is important, and that under circumstances you can make decisions about the Personal Information collected by us. Please keep in mind, though, that if you decide to not provide information required by us in order for us to provide a service or product, your use, and our provision, of our Digital Properties or Services may be limited or impossible to facilitate.</p>
<p><strong><u>Your Data Subject Rights (EU/EEA and UK)</u></strong></p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under applicable data protection laws with respect to Personal Information we knowingly collected. Please see below for more information on the following rights:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Choice</strong></li>
<li><strong>Request access to your personal data</strong></li>
<li><strong>Request correction of your personal data</strong></li>
<li><strong>Request erasure of your personal data </strong></li>
<li><strong>Object to processing of your personal data</strong></li>
<li><strong>Request restriction of processing your personal data</strong></li>
<li><strong>Request transfer of your personal data</strong></li>
<li><strong>Right to withdraw consent</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We will try to comply with any of these requests pertaining to your Personal Information in accordance with applicable law. Please recognize that we may in certain circumstances be unable to provide the access or information sought, or correction or deletion requested. For example, we may be unable to fulfill a request if it requires us to release commercial confidential information, the disclosure of Personal Information relating to another person that is not the requestor, or would result in impracticability, excessive redundancy, and/or an undue burden or expense to the Boston Globe. We may need to verify your identity before acting on your request. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

<strong>Choice</strong>. The Boston Globe enable its readers and subscribers the ability to determine certain privacy preferences that can serve to modify the Personal Information collected. For example, through email marketing preferences, browser cookies, settings, and location settings. However, cookies are very important for our Digital Properties to properly function and disabling or limiting their use may limit or interfere with your experiences or ability to access website features, functions and customizations, particularly user accounts. Certain cookies are essential to the functioning of the Boston Globe websites and may not be disabled.</li>
<li>
<strong>Right to Access</strong>. A person who has provided his or her Personal Information directly to us may have certain access to their Personal Information and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Correction</strong>. You may request correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. In making modifications to your Personal Information, you must provide only truthful, complete, and accurate information. In your request, please be as clear as possible what Personal Information you have provided to us and what Personal Information you would like edited and/or updated.</li>
<li>You may request that we will delete the Personal Information that we hold about you. In your request, please be as clear as possible what Personal Information you have provided to us and what Personal Information you would like deleted. If you ask us to delete your information before we have used it for the necessary purposes set out in this policy, we may not be able to do so, due to technical, legal, regulatory and contractual constraints. For example, we would need to retain your name and contact details for suppression purposes if you do not want to receive direct marketing from us.</li>
<li>
<strong>Object to processing</strong>. You may object to the processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
<li>
<strong>Restriction</strong>. You may request restriction of processing of your personal data which enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Transfer</strong>. You can request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Withdraw consent</strong>. You may withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
