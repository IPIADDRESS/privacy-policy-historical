                      This web site ("Web Site") is operated by Paramount Digital
                      Entertainment, Inc. ("PDE" or "we" or "us"), an affiliate
                      of Paramount Pictures Corporation ("PPC"). This Privacy
                      Policy only covers information collected at our Web Sites,
                      and does not cover any information collected offline by
                      PDE (unless specifically stated), PPC, their parent or affiliated
                      companies. At PDE, your privacy is important to us. We provide
                      this notice to explain our information collection practices
                      and the choices you have about the way your information
                      is collected and used. <a href="javascript:popupsites()">Click
                      here</a> for a list of the web sites currently covered by
                      this Privacy Policy. Your use of this Web Site indicates
                      to us that you have read and accept our privacy practices,
                      as outlined in this Privacy Policy. In addition, please
                      review our <a href="termsofuse.asp">Terms of Use</a> that

                      While on our Web Site, you may encounter links to other
                      web sites or online materials. For example, Paramount.com
                      contains links to web sites that may be published and maintained
                      by affiliates and/or related entities of PDE, including
                      PPC, Spelling Television and Big Ticket Television. You
                      may also encounter links from sponsors or partners, which
                      linked web sites may include a reference to PPC or a PPC
                      logo as part of a co-branding agreement. Those other web
                      sites may set their own cookies, collect data, and/or have
                      their own privacy policies that differ from this privacy
                      policy. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected
                      by PDE on this Web Site, and we encourage you to review
                      the privacy policy of any other web site you visit. <br>
                      <br>
                      This Privacy Policy does not apply to any personally identifiable

                      (such as chat rooms, message boards, or similar web pages).
                      PII is information that could reasonably used to identify
                      you personally (such as your name, address, or e-mail address).
                      You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose PII
                      on message boards, chat areas or other user forums, that
                      information can be collected and used by other people to
                      send unsolicited messages and marketing materials. Also,
                      please be aware that certain message boards (and similar
                      user forums) may display IP addresses along with the message
                      poster's name and message. We bear no responsibility for
                      any action or policies of any third parties who collect

                      Generally, you may browse our Web Site without providing

                      Protecting children's privacy is important to us. For that

                      Web Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no
                      part of our Web Site is targeted to attract anyone under
                      13. We request that all visitors under 13 to our Web Site
                      not disclose or provide any PII. If we discover that a child
                      under 13 has provided us with PII, we will delete the child's
                      PII from our records. <br>

                      <b>Log Data</b>: When you visit this Web Site, our web servers
                      automatically collect anonymous information that describes
                      how our visitors use and navigate our Web Site, and which
                      includes the number and frequency of visitors to each web
                      page and the length of their stays, as well as the anonymous
                      information automatically sent to us by your web browser,
                      such as browser type, referrer data that identifies the
                      web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Web
                      Site, and IP addresses. We also may determine what technology
                      is available through your browser in order to serve you
                      the most appropriate version of a web page. For example,
                      we may determine that you have installed a version of Flash,
                      and we will then send you the appropriate Flash version
                      of the web page rather than an HTML page. <br>

                      to your computer or network when you are on the Internet.
                      When visitors request pages from our Web Site, our servers
                      log the visitor's IP address. We may collect IP addresses
                      for a variety of internal purposes, such as system administration,
                      to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and
                      to audit the number of visits to different pages on our

                      We may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as tracking
                      usage patterns on the Web Site, measuring the effectiveness
                      of advertising, or limiting multiple responses and registrations
                      when we conduct polls and sweepstakes. We do not store any

                      You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by
                      indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your

                      <b>Web Beacons</b>: While you are on our Web Site, or while
                      you are otherwise viewing our content, you may encounter
                      Web beacons, which may come from PDE or from third parties,
                      such as advertisers or content providers. A Web beacon,
                      which is sometimes also called a Web bug or "clear gif",
                      is a small graphic image in a Web page, a Web-based document
                      or an e-mail message, which generally allows the party that
                      set the Web beacon to monitor certain information about
                      the viewer of the Web page, Web-based document or e-mail
                      message, and it may allow access to certain cookies. Web
                      beacons are usually invisible to the user, because they
                      are very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel). However, in general,
                      any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page, including
                      an advertisement, can act as a Web beacon. Web beacons typically
                      collect the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from, the
                      type of browser requesting the Web beacon, the IP address
                      of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to and the time
                      the Web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can also be linked
                      to PII, but PDE does not link information gathered through
                      Web beacons to PII. PDE may use Web beacons to count visitors
                      to our Web pages and we may include Web beacons in HTML-formatted
                      e-mail newsletters in order to count how many newsletters
                      (or particular articles, links, etc.) we sent were actually
                      opened. We aggregate all information we collect through
                      Web beacons and we do not use Web beacons to track any individuals'
                      use of the Web Site. PDE does not have control over Web
                      beacons used by third parties and does not have access to
                      whatever information they may collect. <br>

                      send you an email newsletter or send you information about
                      an upcoming television program or movie. If you e-mail someone
                      else an electronic greeting card or other special feature

                      at any time by returning to the registration area of the

                      specifically agree to a governing set of rules that allow

                      We may employ other companies and individuals to perform
