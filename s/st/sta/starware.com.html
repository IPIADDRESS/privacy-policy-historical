      <p><b>STARWARE TOOLBAR PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>
      <div class="popupCopy" style="text-align: left;">
      <p>At Starware, we work hard at delivering the best possible value at no cost to our users and provide a helpful web tools product with minimally invasive advertising.
       </p><p>Starware's principle revenue is earned through search tools downloaded with our toolbar.  Sites pay to get certain placement within keyword search results. If users find those relevant results attractive and click through to the page, the advertiser pays the search partner for the click.  Our search tools are designed to be as helpful to the user as possible while driving revenue for better Starware products in the future.  
      </p><p>Your happiness and satisfaction is paramount and we only hope to include you as one of our millions of satisfied users.  
      </p><p><b>POLICY OVERVIEW</b>
      </p><p>We want you to feel comfortable downloading and using our products. We understand that your trust in us depends on us respecting your privacy and safeguarding information that you provide us.
      </p><p><b>Practices</b>
      </p><ul>
      <li>Our software is installed only with the user's permission.</li>
      <li>We do not collect or track personal information.</li>
      <li>We design &amp; control all our own distribution channels, always control the download of our own products and, with the exception of Screensavers.com, do not allow third parties to bundle our software.</li>
      <li>We do not bundle third party software.</li>
      <li>We allow you to disable advertising features that you feel are not valuable.</li>
      <li>We make it easy for you to uninstall our software through the standard Add/Remove interface. If you don't like it, simply <a href="uninstall.php">uninstall</a> it.</li>
      <li>We put our brand on our products and provide you with links to our customer service department.</li>
      <li>We are proud of our software and our business and will always tell you what we do.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Data Collection</b>
      </p><p>We need to collect some data to know how many users we have, how our products are performing and where our business is going. We do not exploit our users nor do we collect any data that allows us or anyone else to personally identify a user.
      </p><ul>
      <li>We do not send or collect any information that can personally identify a user.</li>
      <li>We do collect information that is already available to every website you visit. Examples include browser version, language and other browser and connection information.</li>
      <li>We use a unique ID in order to know how many people use our products. This ID is not personally identifying; it is a completely random number.</li>
      <li>We do send a log once per day that tells us how many users are installed.</li>
      <li>We do collect data at our search and travel sites. This is needed to monitor our business performance. This data does not contain any personally identifying information.</li>
      <li>We do not and will not sell or distribute any data collected from the user.</li>
      <li>We do share aggregated information with others. Examples of this include how many users clicked on a particular paid listing in a search result.</li>
      <li>We do take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Search &amp; Default Settings</b>
      </p><p>When you download the Starware Toolbar you get a variety of useful tools and features.  In exchange, our users drive revenue for us by clicking search results delivered in response to the user's own search queries.  Most of our searches are generated through the use of our toolbar. Other search features are activated by the software modifying default Internet Explorer browser settings.  These default settings originally display results to the benefit of Microsoft, using MSN listings. After installing the Starware Toolbar, these search results will be delivered by Starware instead; examples of this include results from the Internet Explorer search box, Error Search and searches conducted through the address bar.  In addition, we display related search suggestions in a panel that appears from the browser frame in response to any search engine query.  These products perform well, as they can be very handy.
      </p><p>Should the user find any of these tools unnecessary or undesirable they can easily be disabled through our "Preferences" menu.  

      </p><p><b>Cookies</b>
      </p><ul>
      <li>We may use cookies to determine if you are a new or existing user and to maintain any personal settings the user may set.</li>
      <li>Our cookies contain no personally identifying information.</li>
      <li>You may disable the use of cookies through Internet Explorer settings.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Updating</b>
      </p><ul>
      <li>Our product is dynamic in much the same way as a web page. Some files reside on the local machine, some reside on our servers. Bug fixes and new features may be added to the product without notice.</li>
      <li>Any new product that requires us to modify our privacy policy will make such requirements known to the user and allow the user to block the data or disable the product. Otherwise updates will be made without notice to the user.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Links</b>
      </p><p>The URLs displayed as search results or other sites linked to by us are developed by people over whom Starware exercises no authority. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information without our knowledge or control.  Under no circumstances shall Starware be liable for any such third party's actions or uses of data.
      </p><p><b>Disable &amp; Removal</b>
      </p><ul>
      <li>You may disable specific features and tools through our Preference settings by clicking the Starware icon on the far left of the toolbar and choosing "Preferences."  This allows you to turn off features you don't like and keep those you do.</li>
      <li>Uninstallation of the Starware Toolbar is very simple.  It's done through Windows' Add/Remove Control Panel.
