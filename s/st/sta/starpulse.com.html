      Privacy Policy</b><br>
      <br>
      Starpulse.com's (SP) policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our 
      users. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you 
      and how we use it. Using the Internet should be a fun experience and we 
      want to help you make it so. The information you provide for suggestions, 
      comments and sweepstakes registration is kept solely within SP. <br>
      <br>
      We will not disclose your personal information to third parties without 
      your consent. SP may disclose user information in special cases when we 
      have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to 
      identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing 
      injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) 
      SP's rights or property, other SP users, or anyone else that could be harmed 
      by such activities. SP may disclose user information when we believe in 
      good faith that the law requires it. <br>
      <br>
      SP shares aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business 
      partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we will say SP 
      audience is x percent females and y percent males. This data is used to 
      customize SP content and advertising to deliver a better experience for 
      our users. <br>
      <br>
      There are cases where SP may ask you for personal information such as your 
      name, email address, and birth date. For example, we request personal information 
      when you register for a sweepstakes, newsletter or when making a comment. 
      SP needs to collect this information for fulfilling prizes, tracking/verifying 
      compliance with SP policies as well as federal, state and local laws and/or 
      for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes.<br>
      <br>
      In case you change your mind or some personal information may change (such 
      as your zip code), we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update 
      or remove the personal data you give us. You can do this by contacting us 
      at <a href="mailto:info@starpulse.com">info@starpulse.com</a>. SP works 
      with a third party that servers ads to this site. To find out more about 
      how flycast manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving
