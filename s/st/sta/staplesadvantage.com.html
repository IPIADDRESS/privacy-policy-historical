You will also continue to receive email or postal mail if you request to hear from us again at a later date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-simple">
<h3>Information Sharing</h3>
<p>In the normal course of business Staples shares Personal Information with third parties. We do this in the following, limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>

We require that these parties agree to process this information based on our instructions and requirements consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>We may disclose Personal Information as reasonably necessary to: (a) satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Staples, its customers or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
<li>We may disclose a customer's name, phone number, postal address and/or ordering information to carefully selected third parties for marketing purposes so that they may notify individuals of offers or services that may be of interest. We do not provide credit card or other financial information for marketing purposes.</li>
<li>We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-Personal Information, such as how many customers viewed a particular product or web page. Such information would not identify you individually.</li>
<li>We may disclose and/or transfer Personal Information to a third party in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale (including any transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings) involving Staples or its affiliated companies or as part of a corporate reorganization, stock or asset sale, or other change in corporate control.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-simple">
<h3>Information Security</h3>
<p>Staples processes Personal Information for the purposes for which it was collected. The information is processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy, any additional privacy notices that may be associated with the service we are supplying, applicable law, or your authorization or consent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-simple">
<p>Staples maintains reasonable and appropriate standards to safeguard your Personal Information. When you enter Personal Information that contains a Social Security Number, driver's license number, or credit or debit card number at the designated and secured sections of our Website, the information will be encrypted or encoded before it is sent over the Internet. Personal Information that we collect and maintain is subject to physical, administrative and technical controls that are consistent with recognized industry standards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-simple">
<p>Staples processes Personal Information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we may process your Personal Information on a server outside your own country in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-simple">
<h3>Data Integrity</h3>
<p>Staples takes reasonable steps to verify that the Personal Information we store and process is accurate, complete and current. We also depend on our customers to update or correct their online profiles and to contact their Staples Account Manager with changes in Personal Information whenever necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-simple">
<p>Unless otherwise required by law or for legitimate business purposes, we will make good faith efforts to correct or delete such data at your request when you notify us of an error or change in your Personal Information. To prevent unauthorized changes to someone's Personal Information, we ask individual customers to positively identify themselves before processing such requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-simple">
<p>We reserve the right to charge a small fee to process any request to update, correct or delete Personal Information. We also may decline to process requests that require a disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-simple">
<h3>Policy Enforcement</h3>
<p>Staples regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or Staples' treatment of Personal Information to us by writing to us at the email or postal mail address contained at the beginning of this document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-simple">
<p>If we receive a written complaint, it is Staples' policy to contact the complaining customer regarding his or her concerns. We will investigate complaints promptly and diligently to address your concerns and resolve any dispute quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-simple">
<h3>What to do if you believe someone has improperly used your personal data</h3>
<p>If you believe that someone has improperly accessed or used your personally identifiable information supplied to Staples or has made purchases at Staples that you did not authorize, please contact us immediately.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-simple">
<p>Here are some additional things that you can do to protect yourself from identity theft if you think that your Personal Information has been compromised:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review Your Account Statements – Carefully review your bank, credit card, and other account statements every month to ensure that all of your account activity is valid. Report any questionable charges promptly and in writing to the card or account issuer.</li>
<li>Check Your Credit Report – Check your credit report periodically to ensure that all your information is correct. You can obtain a free credit report once per year by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com or by calling 877-322-8228. Carefully reviewing your credit report can help you spot problems and address them quickly. If you have any questions about your credit report or notice any inaccuracies, contact the relevant consumer reporting agency promptly at the telephone number listed on the report.</li>
<li>Fraud Alert – Consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. The fraud alert requests that creditors contact you before opening any new accounts or increasing credit limits on your existing accounts. You can place a fraud alert on your credit file by contacting one of three consumer reporting agencies listed below. You need to contact only one of the three agencies; the one you contact is required by law to contact the other two. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and then will be able to order a credit report from each of the three agencies, free of charge.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>The fraud alert will remain in your credit file for at least 90 days.</p>
