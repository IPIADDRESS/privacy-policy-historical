information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable
efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate
confidentiality and security measures.</p>

<p>However, we do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name
or email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or
marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or
feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.</p>

Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself
against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement
agencies, to protect the security or integrity of stackblitz.com.</p>

acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any
of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected
from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of
control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of
laws or equitable principles affecting creditors rights generally, we may not
be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or
used.</p>

companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve
advertisements within stackblitz.com. These third-party ad servers or ad networks
use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links

when this happens.</p>

<p>These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email
address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in
order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
StackBlitz does not provide any personally identifiable information to these
third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of
a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or
opt-out.</p>

<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad
servers or ad networks. StackBlitz’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we
cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</p>
