      <p class="headings"><span class="sub_headings">How We Protect Your Information</span><span class="copy"><br>
        3. STAR safeguards, according to our strict standards of confidentiality, 
        any information our customers share with us. Customer records are securely 
        stored at all times. We continuously strive to maintain complete and accurate 
        information about you and your accounts. Should you ever believe that 
        our records contain inaccurate or incomplete information about you, please 
        notify us. We will investigate your concerns and correct any inaccuracies.</span></p>
      <p class="headings"><span class="copy">4. Access to nonpublic, personal 
        information is limited to employees with a valid business reason for having 
        such access. Employees are trained to understand and comply with our information 
        principles, and any employee who violates our Privacy Policy will be subject 
        to disciplinary action.</span></p>
      <p class="headings"><span class="copy">5. When it comes to sharing customer 
        information with nonaffiliated companies, STAR places strict limits on 
        who receives specific information about customer accounts or other personally 
        identifiable data. To protect your privacy, we only work with companies 
        that agree to safeguard your information and to use that information only 
        for the intended purpose. We do not permit these companies to sell to 
        other third parties the information we provide to them.</span></p>
      <p class="headings"><span class="sub_headings">What You Can Expect From 
        STAR</span><span class="copy"><br>
        6. We will inform you of our Privacy Policy initially and annually of 
        how to remove your name from our marketing lists. You may contact us to 
        remove your name from our lists at any time by calling your local STAR 
        Financial Bank office and asking for our Customer Service Department. 
        If you have any questions about STAR’s Privacy Policy, please contact 
        us.</span></p>
      <p class="headings"><span class="sub_headings">You Can Help</span><span class="copy"><br>
        Protect your account numbers, PINs (personal identification numbers) and 
        passwords. NEVER keep your PIN with your debit, ATM or credit cards. If 
        your card is lost or stolen, thieves will try the numbers they find in 
        your wallet or billfold in an attempt to access your accounts.</span></p>
      <p class="headings"><span class="copy">Be careful about disclosing your 
        account numbers, your social security number and any other personal numbers 
        to others. If someone calls you, claiming to be the bank and asking for 
        your ac-count number—Don't tell. A bank representative will have 
        access to your information and will notneed to ask for it.</span></p>
      <p class="headings"><span class="copy">Keep your information current. If 
        we suspect fraudulent or unauthorized activity on your account, we will 
        attempt to contact you immediately. Please inform us of changes in your 
        address or phone number.</span></p>
