      <p><strong>Your Personal Information</strong></p>
			<p>This Data Protection and Privacy Statement relates solely to information supplied by you on this Web Site.  Standard Chartered Bank, the Data Controller ("SCB") respects the privacy of your personal information and will treat it confidentially and securely.</p>
			<p>Any personal information provided by you to SCB through this Web Site will be used for the purpose of providing and operating the products and services you have requested at this Web Site and for other related purposes which may include updating and enhancing SCB's records, understanding your financial needs, conducting credit checks, reviewing credit worthiness and assisting other financial institutions to conduct credit checks, advising you of other products and services which may be of interest to you, for crime/fraud prevention and debt collection purposes, for purposes required by law or regulation, and to plan, conduct and monitor SCB's business. The information collected from you by SCB will be valuable in improving the design and marketing of our range of services and related products for customer use.  If you are providing your details in connection with an application for employment, please refer to our "Data Protection and Privacy Statement - Job Applicants" which will be displayed when you apply (see our 'Careers' page).
