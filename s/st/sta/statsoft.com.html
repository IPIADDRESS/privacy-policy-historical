Web beacons help us measure the effectiveness of This Website and our advertising in various ways. For example, web beacons may count the number of individuals who visit This Website from a particular advertisement or who make a purchase from This Website after viewing a particular advertisement or they may tell us when a web page is viewed and provide a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Web beacons may also measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns, by counting the number of individuals who open or act upon an email message, determining when an email message is opened and determining how many times an email message is forwarded.</p><p>The information we collect through web beacons may include some limited Personal Information, and web beacons allow us to recognize users by accessing our cookies. We may also combine the information that we collect through web beacons with other information we have collected from you. We use all of this information to better tailor our marketing to you and may use this information for other purposes, such as to enable a shopping cart, customize content on This Website and undertake internal research.</p><p>We prohibit web beacons on This Website from being used by third parties to access Personal Information. We may allow Business Partners to compile individual information or aggregated statistics from the use of web beacons on This Website to determine the effectiveness of online marketing and to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's site. Aggregate information is anonymous and may include demographic and usage information. No Personal Information about you is shared with Business Partners for this research.</p><p>You can make some web beacons unusable by rejecting cookies in your web browser.</p><p><strong>How We Secure Personal Information</strong></p><p>We are committed to protecting the security of Personal Information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure.
