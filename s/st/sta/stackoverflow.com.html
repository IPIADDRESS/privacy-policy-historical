    <p>Stack Overflow, LLC (“Stack Overflow”) operates several websites including stackoverflow.com. It is Stack Overflow’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
    
    <h3>Website Visitors</h3>

    <p>Like most website operators, Stack Overflow collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Stack Overflow’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Stack Overflow’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Stack Overflow may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

    <p>Stack Overflow also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Stack Overflow does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
    
    <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

    <p>Certain visitors to Stack Overflow’s websites choose to interact with Stack Overflow in ways that require Stack Overflow to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Stack Overflow gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who register at stackoverflow.com to provide email address, name, and location. Those who engage in transactions with Stack Overflow – by posting questions or answers, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Stack Overflow collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Stack Overflow. Stack Overflow does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
    
    <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>

    <p>Stack Overflow may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Stack Overflow may monitor the most popular parts of the stackoverflow.com site. Stack Overflow may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Stack Overflow does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

    <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

    <p>Stack Overflow discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Stack Overflow’s behalf or to provide services available at Stack Overflow’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Stack Overflow’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Stack Overflow will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Stack Overflow discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Stack Overflow believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Stack Overflow, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Stack Overflow website and have supplied your email address, Stack Overflow may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Stack Overflow and our products. We primarily use blog.stackoverflow.com to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Stack Overflow takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

    <h3>Cookies</h3>

    <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Stack Overflow uses cookies to help Stack Overflow identify and track visitors, their usage of Stack Overflow website, and their website access preferences. Stack Overflow visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Stack Overflow’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Stack Overflow’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

    <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

    <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Stack Overflow may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Stack Overflow’s sole discretion. Stack Overflow encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
