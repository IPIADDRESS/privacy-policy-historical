<li><span style="color: #323232;"> Cookies We use cookies for your convenience. For example, we use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate and otherwise use our Website. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive. Cookies can be used to "remember" what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move between and interact with Web pages and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. The Website also uses cookies to store and sometimes track information to make your online experience easier and more personalized and for other purposes related to your use of the Website and related services. For example, because a cookie can be linked to information you have inputted or which has otherwise been collected, the need to repetitively enter certain information, such as your username or email address, can be eliminated. The use of cookies also assists us in acquiring important Website usage Data. Cookies can also assist us in tracking and targeting the interests, preferences and desires of our Website users to present the most appropriate messages, offers and other communications to our users, and to generally enhance their experience at our Website.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #323232;">Currently, there are two general types of cookies commonly used in association with typical Web sites including our Website: "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies. A session or "session ID" cookie is functional only during the current "session" use of your browser, i.e., it ceases to function when you close you browser. A "persistent" cookie remains on your hard beyond the current browser session. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "Help" file. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #323232;">Also, some Website use rewards and other benefits tied to Website usage use session cookies to track your Website usage and give you proper credit. We also use persistent cookies to track the actions of our users to enhance the experience on our site, other websites and to more effectively communicate Offers, promotional data and other useful information to you. At the present time, we intend to also adopt and use helpful future cookie technology, and similar types of technologies, as they become available. We may implement any and all such new technologies and similar improvements to Website functionality without notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #323232;">We may also track special offers, promotions and other advertising delivered by us, and your responses to them, by using cookies. This helps us reduce the number of offers that might not be interesting to you. We also use cookies to help us credit persons who referred or introduced you to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #323232;">The Website may also automatically collect traffic and click-through data as well as information regarding the online behavior of subscribers and other Website users by the use of cookies or other programming means. Any and all information about Website users collected by the Company, or its agents or affiliates via the Website or otherwise, through the use of cookies or other programming means may be freely included in our databases and used in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #323232;">Some of our Third Party Program Participants, advertisers, agents and others use cookies on or in association with our Website. We have no access to or control over these cookies. We may also allow third-party service providers to deliver special offers or services to Website users and to control the use of their cookies on your computer. Since such providers may set, access and otherwise control their cookies on your computer, we urge you to consult their privacy policies as they pertain to use of their cookies and the data collected from such use.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #323232;">Most major Web browsers are set up so that they will initially accept cookies, but you may modify your computers preferences to issue you an alert when a cookie is downloaded, or to disable the ability of third parties to download a cookie to you. If you choose to reject cookies, or disable your computerâs ability to receive or process them, there are areas of this Website, other related websites and related services that may not function properly. For example, you may not be able to view or interact with parts of the Website or access some of the services or offers otherwise available on the Website. Also, if you disable or reject cookies, you may not be credited for actions required for certain gifts and other benefits, and therefore may not receive such benefits.</span></p>

<li><span style="color: #323232;"> Clear GIFs ("Web Beacons")</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #323232;">Clear GIFs, otherwise known as "Web Beacons" or "single-pixel GIFs", are very small web page graphics that contain a unique digital identifying means. They function like cookies, in that they are often used to track and measure online actions taken by website users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded into the graphics, text or other components of Web pages, including pop up windows, or in other digital documents that can support them, like email messages. We may also use Web Beacons to optimize search engine functionality. Clear GIFs are nearly invisible and are often only the size of small dot, such as a period at the end of a sentence. Also, like cookies, Clear GIFs, help us and our Third Party Program Participants measure and improve Website efficiency and effectiveness. For example, we may use web beacon technology to access your personally identifiable information or compile aggregated statistics about overall Website usage.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #323232;">Many of our Third Party Program Participants and advertisers also employ Clear GIFs on our Website and in related sites.</span></p>
