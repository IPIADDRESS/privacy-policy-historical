                <p>We have a <strong>zero tolerance</strong> for spam at Stage 32. And while we realize that many of our members have a company to promote, a crowdfunding project they'd like to get exposure for, or even perhaps a reel they'd like to get more eyes on, we ask that you do so in an organic way.</p>

                <p>The following are not permitted:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Spamming multiple member walls or multiple Lounge topics with the same message or promotion.</li>
                    <li>Sending canned private messages to multiple accounts.</li>
                    <li>Soliciting payment for a product or service via wall posts, Lounge posts, private message, project posting, etc. Crowdfunding promotion for your own projects is allowed in the appropriate sections of the Stage 32 Lounge.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Violation of any of these spam policies will result in an automatic account suspension and removal of the offending content.</p>

                <p>We ask all of our members to be active in the community. To not only self promote, but to participate in conversations and offer assistance and guidance to other members where possible.</p>

<p>3.	Cookies<br>
We use cookies for your convenience.  For example, we use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate and otherwise use our Website. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive.  Cookies can be used to "remember" what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move between and interact with Web pages and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet.  The Website also uses cookies to store and sometimes track information to make your online experience easier and more personalized and for other purposes related to your use of the Website and related services.  For example, because a cookie can be linked to information you have inputted or which has otherwise been collected, the  need to repetitively enter certain information, such as your username or email address, can be eliminated. The use of cookies also assists us in acquiring important Website usage Data.  Cookies can also assist us in tracking and targeting the interests, preferences and desires of our Website users to present the most appropriate messages, offers and other communications to our users, and to generally enhance their experience at our Website. </p>
<p>Currently, there are two general types of cookies commonly used in association with typical Web sites including our Website:  "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies.  A session or "session ID" cookie is functional only during the current "session" use of your browser, i.e., it ceases to function when you close you browser.  A "persistent" cookie remains on your hard beyond the current browser session. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "Help" file. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. </p>
<p>Also, some Website use rewards and other benefits tied to Website usage use session cookies to track your Website usage and give you proper credit.  We also use  persistent cookies to track the actions of our users to enhance the experience on our site, other websites and to more effectively communicate Offers,  promotional data and other useful information to you.  At the present time, we intend to  also adopt and use helpful future cookie technology, and similar types of technologies, as they become available. We may implement any and all such new technologies and similar improvements to Website functionality without notice. </p>
<p>We may also track special offers, promotions and other advertising delivered by us, and your responses to them, by using cookies.  This helps us reduce the number of offers that might not be interesting to you. We also use cookies to help us credit persons who referred or introduced you to us.  </p>
<p>The Website may also automatically collect traffic and click-through data as well as information regarding the online behavior of subscribers and other Website users by the use of cookies or other programming means.  Any and all information about Website users collected by the Company, or its agents or affiliates via the Website or otherwise, through the use of cookies or other programming means may be freely included in our databases and used in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Some of our Third Party Program Participants, advertisers, agents and others use cookies on or in association with our Website. We have no access to or control over these cookies.  We may also allow third-party service providers to deliver special offers or services to Website users and to control the use of their cookies on your computer. Since such providers may set , access and otherwise control  their cookies on your computer, we urge you to  consult their privacy policies as they pertain to use of their cookies and the data collected from such use. </p>
<p>Most major Web browsers are set up so that they will initially accept cookies, but you may modify your computers preferences to issue you an alert when a cookie is downloaded, or to disable the ability of third parties to download a cookie to you.  If you choose to reject  cookies, or disable your computer’s ability to receive or process them, there are areas of this Website, other related websites and related services that may not function properly.  For example, you may not be able to view or interact with parts of the Website or access some of the services or offers otherwise available on the Website.  Also, if you disable or reject cookies, you may not be credited for actions required for certain gifts and other benefits, and therefore may not receive such benefits. </p>
<p>You may obtain further information about "cookies" and how they function at:<br>
<a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com" title="http://www.cookiecentral.com">http://www.cookiecentral.com</a> or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm" title="http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm</a>.</p>
<p>4.	Clear GIFs ("Web Beacons") </p>
<p>Clear GIFs, otherwise known as "Web Beacons" or "single-pixel GIFs", are very small web page graphics that contain a unique digital identifying  means.  They function like cookies, in that they are often used to track and measure online actions taken by website users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded into the graphics, text or other components of Web pages, including pop up windows, or in other digital documents that can support them, like email messages.  We may also use Web Beacons to optimize search engine functionality. Clear GIFs are nearly invisible and are often only the size of small dot, such as a period at the end of a sentence.  Also, like cookies, Clear GIFs, help us and our Third Party Program Participants measure and improve Website efficiency and effectiveness.  For example, we may use web beacon technology to access your personally identifiable information or compile aggregated statistics about overall Website usage. </p>
<p>Many of our Third Party Program Participants and advertisers also employ Clear GIFs on our Website and in related sites.  </p>
<p>5.  	Log Files</p>
<p>The Company and Third Party Program Participants, through the functionality of the Website, related sites and related services, gather Data and other information regarding Website navigation and Website use from cookies, clear GIFs and other means and store such information in log files and other databases.  This Data and similar information includes date and time recordation data, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, Internet service provider (ISP) data, referring or exit pages, your computer’s operating system and components, such as your browser type, and other data. While this information generally does not directly identify individual users, it does provide us with Data and other broad demographic information. We use this information for a number of purposes including Website usage analysis, analysis of Website  navigation by users, determining and analyzing overall user preferences and user trends,  Website administration, and general improvement and optimization of Website efficiency and effectiveness and user communications, including promotions to users.  We  may also provide third parties with some or all such information and other Data collected</p>
<p>6.  	Use of Personal Information and Disclaimer </p>
<p>We may request personal identification information from you (such as your name, street address, telephone number, credit card number, email address, and/or any other identifier that permits the physical or online contacting of you) in connection with your use of, participation in, and/or membership registration for the Website, our contests, sweepstakes, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content submissions, chats, bulletin boards, discussion groups, requests for suggestions, visitors' requests for free products or services or additional information (including via email to us), and in connection with other activities, services or resources we make available on any of our sites. In all of these cases, we will collect personal identification information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us.<br>
If you do provide us with personal information, such as your email address, for any of these activities, you agree that we may use it to conduct the activity and we may also use it for all other purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy, and all other lawful purposes, including, without limitation, we may use the information to verify identity, protect against fraud, update and service your account, target and personalize future Offers that we or any of our affiliates may display on or in association with the Website or otherwise offer. We will use your physical mailing address for fulfilling Offers you have accepted, to improve our ability to provide you with more accurate and appropriate marketing and for other communications with our Company.</p>
<p>If you provide the Company with Optional Information, we may also use such personal identification information for internal or external marketing and promotional purposes.  For example, we may send you emails to introduce a product or service that we think might be of interest to the users of our Website.

<p>7.	Offers, Special Promotions, Opinion Polls, Surveys, Contests, Special Events and Service<br>
Alert E-mails</p>
<p>There may be occasions when a visitor, subscriber, member or other Website user will be presented with special offers either from the operators of the Website, their agents, affiliates or from other third-party offerors, that may include the presentation of one or more options for a Website user to consent to receive e-mail solicitations, communications, newsletters or commercial advertising, or to participate in other promotions or special events, including without limitation, contests, opinion polls or surveys (collectively referred to as "Offers").  Offers might be made by the Company, its agents, affiliates, Third Party Program Participants or other third-parties making such Offers.  Website users may be asked to provide certain information in order to participate in such Offers.  Information requested may include, without limitation, contact information (such as name and address) and demographic information (such as zip code, area code, age level, occupation, etc.).   Participation in such special events and special offers is completely voluntary and Website users may elect whether or not to provide the requested information.  Information collected will be used for the purposes of winner notification, prize awarding, monitoring and improving Website usage and user satisfaction,  providing additional relevant offers, promotions and other communications to Website users via electronic mail and other means, and other purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>"OPT-IN" Acceptance of Offers. Some Offers may be presented to you with the option to express your  preference by either clicking or entering "accept" (or alternatively, for example, "yes") or "decline" (alternatively "no") or "consent" or by indicating your preference regarding participation or non-participation by some other recordable means.  By selecting accept, yes, consent, or some other affirmation of participation, you shall be deemed to agree that such action(s) shall constitute an  "OPT-IN" to the Offer related to the action and that the you thereby agree and assent that your personal information, Data, Optional Information and other information in the Website's databases may be disclosed to the Company, the Company’s affiliates, agents, Third Party Program Participants and other third-parties offerors.</p>
<p>"OPT-OUT" Rejection of Offers Otherwise Accepted.  Some Offers may be presented with a pre-selected preference or choice.  If you do not deselect the pre-selected preference of choice (i.e. "OPT-OUT" of the Offer) then the Website may transfer your personal information to the Company, its affiliates, agents, Third Party Program Participants, and any other third party making the Offer.  If you deselect the pre-selected preference (i.e., reject the Offer) then no personal information relating to the Offer in the Website's database may be disclosed to a third party offeror of that particular Offer with respect to that particular Offer.  Nothing herein shall limit information collection or transfer that you have previously authorized or subsequently authorize, including, without limitation any authorization regarding  the third party offeror with respect to another Offer.  </p>
<p>The Company may also send new members, subscribers, visitors or other Website users a welcoming e-mail and occasionally send information on products, services, and special deals from Third Party Program Participants, and other third parties.  If you don't want to receive such e-mail or other e-mail messages from us, please follow the directions for unsubscribing or "opting-out" contained in the e-mail message you receive from us. We reserve the right to contact you, however, with non-commercial relationship and  other advisory e-mail messages, such as communications of  changes or updates to our software, changes to our Terms and Conditions, changes to Offers you have accepted, changes to programs you have elected to participate in, notice of termination of any Offer, program or service or changes to this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>We may provide you with links in our e-mail communications.  These links may include one or more special tracking codes, unique to you or some other identifying feature (such as geo-location).  These codes assist us in formulating, selecting and distributing content, promotions, Offers, advertisements and other communications to you which are more appropriately targeted to your likely preferences. We may share this data in aggregate form or in individual form. </p>
<p>The Company and/or Third Party Program Participants may offer you participation in one or more "rewards" programs in which you can earn money or other benefits for participating in such programs. The Company and/or Third Party Program Participants may provide information collected from you as a result of your participation in such program(s) to the program sponsor to assist the sponsor in delivering entitled benefits to you and for other marketing, promotional and other purposes.  If you participate in any of the Company’s own reward or incentive programs, we will track your activity using your e-mail address or other identifying means and share your e-mail address and other identifying means with affiliated reward sponsors, if any, and any third parties involved with fulfillment of the rewards or other benefits. </p>
<p>The Company does not provide a process to update or modify a Website user's personally identifiable information.  If you no longer desire to use one or more of our services, you must, as relevant, opt-out of our mailings, unsubscribe, cancel membership, remove Company, Third Party Program Participant and/or other third party distributed software from your computer, and/or discontinue the use of the Website and services. 			</p>
<p>8.	 Revocation of Consent Procedure (Revocation "Opting-Out")</p>

We reserve the right at all times to terminate or suspend any subscription, membership, Offer, service or account at any time with or without notice. </p>
<p>9.	Third Party Program Participants and Others</p>
<p>We may send you offers on behalf of Third Party Program Participants.

You agree that these Companies may also independently send you Offers.  If you would like to opt-out or cancel any such Offers or prevent Third Party Program Participants from independently communicating with you, you will need to inform them separately pursuant to their process for doing so.  You agree that that the Company shall at not time be responsible or liable in any manner for any delay or failure by any Third Party Program Participant to effectively process any opt-out or cancellation request. </p>
<p>The Company shares aggregated demographic and Website navigation information, Data, Optional Information and other information with Third Party Program Participants, advertisers, analysts and others.  We may also sell access to our mailing lists, including e-mail lists, and other information to brokers and third party advertisers and we may transfer your information to such third parties.

We may also hire contractors or other third parties to perform any Company, Website or Website service function with or without notice to you.  The Company and its agents may also aggregate demographic and other information about you and other Website users in databases and disclose, license or sell such information to Third Party Program Participants and other parties.</p>
<p>By your use or continued use of the Website or acceptance of any Offer associated with the Website, you expressly agree that this Privacy Policy, all Data, Optional Information and other information collected by the Company, its agents, affiliates, Third Party Program Participants and all other third parties associated with the Company or the Website, all contractual rights and all rights arising under the <a href="/terms">Terms and Conditions</a> may be freely and unconditionally transferred, assigned, sold, leased or licensed to any person or entity and that all Offers are subject to change and may be terminated by the Company or any third party initiating the Offer, with or without notice. </p>
<p>10. 	Disclosure </p>
<p>The Company will not disclose or use any of your personally identifiable information except to the extent set forth in this Privacy Policy, or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the Website’s Terms and Conditions, defrauding the Company or any third party, including any Third Party Program Participant. </p>
<p>The Company will disclose your personal information, without notice, to a party unrelated to the Company if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with the law, legal process served on the Company or a Third Party Program Participant, to protect the rights or property of the Company or a Third Party Program Participant, or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Website or the public at large. </p>
<p>All unsolicited information provided to the Company or any affiliated party, including, without limitation, any Third Party Program Participant, entirely on the initiative of a person providing the information or that person’s agent, or any information which is provided independently of any request by the Company or its affiliates shall be deemed to be public information regarding which neither the Company nor any other person or entity has any duty to the information provider or any other person, and as such, the Company may use such unsolicited information in an unlimited manner.</p>
