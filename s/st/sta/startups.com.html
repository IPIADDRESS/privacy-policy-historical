<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At Startups.com we believe your 
    privacy is of the highest priority. As such, we strive to ensure that any 
    personal information you provide is protected. The following describes our 
    committment to privacy of your information, the information we gather, and 
    how that information is used. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This site has security measures 
    in place to help protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information 
    under our control. The information is stored in a secure operating environment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All Startups.com mailing lists 
    are 100% OPT-IN. We will never send you email unless you first request it 
    or join a Startups.com administered mailing list. Additionally, your email 
    address and personal information is reserved for internal use only and will 
    never be sold or shared to any third party. Users may opt-out of receiving 
    future mailings. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Startups.com does record and track 
    I.P. addresses, browser information (such as version, make and model), and 
    referring links (i.e. how you got to the page). This information helps us 
    analyze site traffic patterns and usage as well as improve our product offering 
    and quality of service. Startups.com will use and disseminate to our partners 
    non-identifying aggregate demographic information for market research purposes. 
    Again, please realize that this information cannot be used in any way to identify 
    you, but instead to understand the profiles of our typical users and broad 
    website usage patterns. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We use your IP address to help 
    diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. We use cookies 
    (bits of information that are stored on your hard drive) to help us identify 
    you and present your personalized information, such as the events you are 
    planning or are invited to attend. Any password saved through use of a cookie 
    will expire when you close your browser; this ensures your security.</font></p>
