  </big></font><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Privacy Notice</font><font face="Arial" size="2">
  - </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">Version 1.0, </font><font face="Arial" size="1">October
  10, 2000</font></p>
  <hr size="1" noshade="" width="555" align="left">
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thank you for visiting ConneCT - the official
  web site for the State of Connecticut. ConneCT is committed to protecting your
  privacy and to making your on-line experience enjoyable, secure, comfortable,
  and valuable. This notice fully discloses our privacy policy and information
  practices. We describe in detail what user information we collect, how we use
  it and how we disclose it. You do not have to provide personal information to
  visit ConneCT web sites or download information.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">ConneCT policy is to respect and protect the
  privacy of our website users, consistent with the applicable laws of the
  United States and the State of Connecticut, including the Connecticut Freedom
  of Information Act and the Connecticut Personal Data Act. We do not collect,
  use or disclose any information about our users without their knowledge and
  approval. We do not share user information with third parties unless we have
  informed users about the disclosures or when we have prior consent.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, it is possible that ConneCT could
  be required to disclose personal information in response to valid legal
  process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order. All record
  keepers face the possibility that disclosure of their records may be compelled
  in some civil, criminal, or administrative matters. Disclosures may also be
  appropriate to protect ConneCT's legal rights or during emergencies if
  physical safety is believed to be at risk. We think that these events are
  unlikely, but they are possible.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Policy Revision and Notification of Changes</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">ConneCT will update this policy from time to
  time as we add new services and new features. We will tell our users about
  changes in this policy by making changes on this page, which will always
  contain a version number and date, making it easy to see when changes have
  taken place. Any information collected under this current policy will remain
  subject to the terms of the privacy policy. After any changes take effect, all
  new information collected, if any, will be subject to the revised privacy
  policy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>What Information About Users Does The State
  Of Connecticut Collect?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Automatic Information</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The following information is collected and
  stored automatically from all users accessing the ConneCT web sites to browse
  or download information:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Internet domain and Internet Protocol
      address from which you access our site;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The type of browser and operating system
      used to access our site;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The date and time you access our site;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The pages you visit; and</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If you linked to ConneCT from another
      website, the address of that website.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This information is used to create summary
  statistics, which are used for purposes such as assessing what information is
  of most interest to users, determining technical design specifications, and
  identifying system performance or problem areas.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This information is not reported or used in any
  manner that would reveal personally identifiable information and will not be
  released to any outside (third) parties unless legally required to do so.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Personal Information You Provide to Us</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">ConneCT does not obtain personally identifiable
  information about you when you visit our web sites unless you choose to
  provide such information to us (i.e. sending an e-mail, participating in a
  survey, responding to a feedback or "contact us" form, etc.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We consider any information that could
  reasonably be used to identify you personally as personally identifying
  information. This includes, but is not limited to:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Your name</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Your address</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Your e-mail address</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Your Social Security number</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Your password</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Bank account information</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Credit card information</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Any combination of data that could be used
      to identify you such as your birth date, your zip code and your gender.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Government agencies may request personally
  identifiable information from you in order to provide requested services, but
  such information is handled as it would be on an in-person visit to a
  government office.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If personal information is requested on the web
  site or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974
  may protect it. However, this information is a public record once you provide
  it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by
  federal or state law.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>E-Mail Communications and Web Forms</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you send us an electronic mail message with
  a question or comment that contains personally identifying information, or
  fill out a form that e-mails us information, we will only use this personally
  identifying information to respond to your request and analyze trends. We may
  redirect your message to another government agency or person who is in a
  better position to answer your question .</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All e-mail addresses collected by ConneCT
  contain the names of people who voluntarily communicated with or requested
  information from us. E-mail addresses are not sold, leased or shared with any
  governmental or commercial entities. When a user has given us his/her e-mail
  address for purposes of communicating with or requesting information from
  ConneCT, that communication becomes part of the public record and may be
  subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state
  law.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Does ConneCT use Cookies?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We do not use cookies to collect information on
  the ConneCT site. NOTE: A cookie file is a text file, not an executable
  program, which is sent from a web server to the user's machine when the user's
  browser accesses the server's site. The server cannot find out your name or
  e-mail address, or anything about your computer using cookies. Cookies can
  only tell a web server if you have been there before and can pass short bits
  of information from the web server back to itself the next time you visit.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Does The State Of Connecticut Share The
  Information It Receives With Anyone?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">ConneCT believes the service we provide to our
  users should make their lives easier, without the fear that their personal
  data will end up in the wrong hands. Except as provided by applicable state
  and federal laws, we do not collect, use or disclose any information about our
  users without their knowledge and approval. We do not share user information
  with third parties unless we have informed users about the disclosures or when
  we have prior consent.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, this privacy policy describes the
  basic data disclosures that we make with our contractors in order to support
  our core functions and features. Our contractors comply with the same strict
  limits on use and disclosure of user data. Our website partners may have
  different use and disclosure policies.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Contractors</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">ConneCT may contract with other companies to
  assist in supporting our core features and functions. When necessary for these
  services to function, we exchange user information with these companies or
  those users who have selected those services. We require that our contractors
  treat our users' data under the same high privacy, security and fair
  information practices standards that ConneCT uses. Personal data provided to
  our contractors are not sold, rented, or shared by them except as necessary to
  accomplish the purpose of the disclosure. It also means that our contractors
  will not use personal data for marketing to our users.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Partners</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some users of ConneCT may come to us through
  web sites that we may co-sponsor with other web companies or through links to
  ConneCT provided at other web sites. These other sites are our website
  partners. We do not share user information with website partners unless a user
  tells us to do so. Once a user directs us to send information to a website
  partner, the information in the partner's possession becomes subject to the
  website partner's privacy policies and practices, which may differ from
  ConneCT's policies and practices. At ConneCT, we will continue to protect user
  information in accordance with this privacy policy. ConneCT makes no
  representations or warranties about, and has no liability or responsibility
  toward its users in connection with, our website partners or their privacy
  policies. We urge users to read the privacy policy of any website before
  providing any personal information.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Can I Access, Edit and Correct My Personal
  Information?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Because the ConneCT site does not collect any
  personally identifiable information other than what you provide us in your
  e-mail correspondence and because we do not match any of that personally
  identifiable information with any of the automatic data that we do record, we
  generally cannot identify, and therefore, cannot provide any information about
  your visit to ConneCT.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, we recognize many concerns people have
  with regard to public records that include information about them, including
  the right to correct inaccurate information. Consequently, persons concerned
  with regard to information about them should contact the custodian of the
  record, which typically is the state agency or other governmental entity that
  collects and maintains the information.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Do I Have a Choice About Whether or Not My
  Personal Information is Provided to Others?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">ConneCT does not obtain personally identifiable
  information about you when you visit our web sites unless you choose to
  provide such information to us (i.e. sending an e-mail, participating in a
  survey, responding to a feedback or "contact us" form, etc.). We do
  not<br>
  disclose, sell, lease or provide any personal information about our users to
  any other government or commercial entity for any purpose.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There may be instances where we send ongoing
  updates or announcements to interested parties. In such cases, visitors will
  have the choice whether or not to receive these updates or announcements.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, it is important to understand that,
  under applicable state and federal law, various forms of correspondence and
  other communications, i.e. comments concerning web sites, state government
  programs and processes, policies, activities and other types of general
  correspondence may be subject to public disclosure.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Commitment to Security</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Department of Information Technology, which
  manages the computing infrastructure to support ConneCT, understands the value
  of and our dependency on the data, information, and computer systems used in
  serving the needs of our users. As a part of it's everyday operations, the
  Department of Information Technology has put into place appropriate safeguards
  to insure that any personal information and technical infrastructures are
  secure from destruction, corruption, unauthorized access and breach of
  confidentiality whether accidental or deliberate. This includes ongoing review
  and implementation of security measures and plans, the use of new technology
  when available and appropriate, and regular training for their personnel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Disclaimer/Links to other Sites</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">ConneCT contains links to other web sites.
  These may include links to web sites operated by other government agencies,
  non-profit organizations and private businesses. When you link to another
  site, you are no longer on the ConneCT web site and this privacy notice does
  not apply. When you link to another web site, you are subject to the privacy
  policy of that web site.</font></p>
