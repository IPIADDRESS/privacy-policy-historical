  </big></font><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Privacy Notice</font><font face="Arial" size="2">
  - </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">Version 1.0, </font><font face="Arial" size="1">October
  11, 2000&nbsp; (DRAFT pending legal review)</font></p>
  <hr size="1" noshade="" width="555" align="left">
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thank you for visiting ConneCT - the official
  web site for the State of Connecticut. ConneCT is committed to protecting your
  privacy and to making your on-line experience enjoyable, secure, comfortable,
  and valuable. This notice discloses our privacy policy and information
  practices for the State of Connecticut.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">ConneCT policy is to respect and protect the
  privacy of our website users, consistent with the applicable laws of the
  United States and the State of Connecticut, including the Connecticut Freedom
  of Information Act and the Connecticut Personal Data Act. We do not collect,
  use or disclose any information about our users without their knowledge and
  approval. We do not share user information with third parties unless we have
  informed users about the disclosures or when we have prior consent.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Visitors should be aware that the State of
  Connecticut could be required to disclose personal information in response to
  valid legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order. All
  record keepers face the possibility that disclosure of their records may be
  compelled in some civil, criminal, or administrative matters. Disclosures may
  also be necessary to protect the State's legal rights or during emergencies if
  physical safety is believed to be at risk. We think that these events are
  unlikely, but they are possible.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Policy Revision and Notification of Changes</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">ConneCT will update this policy as new services
  and features are added. We will tell our users about policy changes through
  notices on this page, which will always contain a version number and date. Any
  information collected under the current policy will remain subject to these
  terms. Information collected after any changes take effect will be subject to
  the revised privacy policy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>What Information About Users Does The State
  Of Connecticut Collect?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Automatic Information</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The following information is collected and
  stored automatically from all users accessing the ConneCT web sites to browse
  or download information:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Internet domain and Internet Protocol
      address from which you access our site;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The type of browser and operating system
      used to access our site;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The date and time you access our site;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The pages you visit; and</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If you linked to ConneCT from another
      website, the address of that website.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This information is used to create summary
  statistics, which are used for purposes such as assessing what information is
  of most interest to users, determining technical design specifications, and
  identifying system performance or problem areas.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This information is not reported or used in any
  manner that would reveal personally identifiable information, and will not be
  released to any outside (third) parties unless legally required.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Personal Information You Provide to Us</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">ConneCT does not obtain personally identifiable
  information about you when you visit our web sites unless you choose to
  provide such information to us (i.e. sending an e-mail, participating in a
  survey, responding to a feedback or "contact us" form, etc.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We consider any information that could
  reasonably be used to identify you as "personally identifying
  information." This includes, but is not limited to:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Your name</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Your address</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Your e-mail address</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Your Social Security number</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Your password</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Bank account information</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Credit card information</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Any combination of data that could be used
      to identify you such as your birth date, your zip code and your gender.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Government agencies may request personally
  identifiable information from you in order to provide requested services, but
  such information is handled as it would be on an in-person visit to a
  government office.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If personal information is requested on the web
  site or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974
  may protect it. However, this information is a public record once you provide
  it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by
  federal or state law.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>E-Mail Communications and Web Forms</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you send us an electronic mail message with
  a question or comment that contains personally identifying information, or
  fill out a form that e-mails us information, we will only use this personally
  identifying information to respond to your request. We may redirect your
  message to another government agency or person who is in a better position to
  answer your question.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All e-mail addresses collected by ConneCT
  contain the names of people who voluntarily communicated with or requested
  information from us. E-mail addresses are not sold, leased or shared with any
  governmental or commercial entities without their consent. When a user has
  given us their e-mail address for purposes of communicating with or requesting
  information from ConneCT, that communication becomes part of the public record
  and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by
  federal or state law.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Does ConneCT use Cookies?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We do not use cookies to collect information on
  the ConneCT site. A cookie is a text file, not a program, which is sent to
  your computer when you access a site. Cookies do not disclose your name or
  e-mail address to a web site. They can only tell a web site if you have
  visited before and can pass short bits of information from the web site back
  to itself the next time you visit.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Does The State Of Connecticut Share The
  Information It Receives With Anyone?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Except as provided by applicable state and
  federal laws, we do not collect, use or disclose user information without
  their knowledge and approval. We do not share user information with third
  parties unless we have informed users about the disclosures or have prior
  consent.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, all State of Connecticut
  contractors must comply with this policy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Can I Access and Correct My Personal
  Information?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Persons concerned about information contained
  in their personal records should contact the custodian of the record, which
  typically is the state agency or other governmental entity that collects and
  maintains the information.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">ConneCT does not collect any personally
  identifiable information other than what you provide in your e-mail
  correspondence. The automatic data recorded is not matched with any of that
  personally identifiable information. Therefore, information cannot be provided
  about your visit.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Do I Have a Choice About Whether or Not My
  Personal Information is Provided to Others?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">ConneCT does not obtain personally identifiable
  information about you when you visit our web sites unless you choose to
  provide such information to us (i.e. sending an e-mail, participating in a
  survey, responding to a feedback or "contact us" form, etc.). We do
  not disclose, sell, lease or provide any personal information about our users
  to any other government or commercial entity for any purpose.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There may be instances where we send ongoing
  updates or announcements to interested parties. In such cases, visitors will
  have the choice whether or not to receive these updates or announcements.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, it is important to understand that
  under applicable state and federal law, various forms of correspondence and
  other communications may be subject to public disclosure.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Commitment to Security</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Department of Information Technology, which
  manages the computers that support ConneCT, has put into place appropriate
  safeguards to ensure that any personal information is secure from destruction,
  corruption, unauthorized access and breach of confidentiality. This effort
  includes an ongoing review of safety measures, implementation of changes, and
  regular training for their personnel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Disclaimer/Links to other Sites</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">ConneCT contains links to other web sites.
  These may include links to web sites operated by other government agencies,
  non-profit organizations and private businesses. When you link to another
  site, you are no longer on the ConneCT web site and this privacy notice does
  not apply. When you link to another web site, you are subject to the privacy
  policy of that web site.</font></p>
