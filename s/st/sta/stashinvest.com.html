<p>At Collective Returns Inc., dba StashInvest (“Stash”), our most important asset is our relationship with you.</p>
<p>We are required by law to ask for certain information in order to perform our services for you, but we are committed to protecting your personal and financial information. This Privacy Policy answers some questions about what information we collect, what we do with it, and how we protect it. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.</p>
<div class="text__subtitle buffer__top center-xs text-purple buffer__bottom-20"><strong style="line-height: inherit; text-align: inherit;"> Our Policy </strong></div>
<p>Welcome to the web site&nbsp;<a class="link__blue" href="http://www.stashinvest.com/">www.stashinvest.com</a>&nbsp;(the “Site” or “Mobile Application”) owned and operated by Collective Returns, Inc. (Henceforward “Stash”, “StashInvest,” “Stash,” “we,” “us,” and/or “our”). This Site has been created to provide information about our company and its web-based portfolio management services (the “Services”) to all users of the Site or Service who in any way use the Site or Mobile Application provided by Stash (in each case, a “User”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Stash’s policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”), and other information that is collected from Site visitors and users of the Services.</p>
<div class="text__subtitle buffer__top center-xs text-purple buffer__bottom-20"><strong style="line-height: inherit; text-align: inherit;"> Information We Collect </strong></div>
<p>When you interact with us through the Site or the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p>
<p>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information such as when you register for access to the Services (for example, contact information such as your name, email address, and mailing address; and when you wish to use certain Services (for example financial information such as bank account numbers, your Date of Birth and your social security number).</p>
<p>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Stash and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.</p>
<p>Information from Third-Party Sources: We may also collect Personal Data and information about our transactions and those you engage in with our affiliates, unaffiliated third parties, banking verification services(Plaid) and information from consumer reporting agencies. We may further collect information about you from third-party data sources, such as brokers, banks and government databases and combine it with data we collect from you.</p>
<p>Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data: When you interact with Stash through the Site or Services, we receive and store certain non-identifiable information about you. Such information, which may be collected passively using various technologies or through other means, cannot be used to specifically identify you.</p>
<p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. Stash may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Stash affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Stash often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to Stash by Issuers and Users.</p>
<p>This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. Stash may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally. Stash may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>
<p>In operating this Site, we may also use data collection tools such as web beacons, pixel tags, embedded links, cookies, and other similar techniques. A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features.</p>
<p>The use of cookies by our any of our affiliates or service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and use our Services.</p>

This information will help us to improve the Stash Site and the overall user experience. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect standard internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. None of the information gathered is personally identifiable in nature without your expressed permission.</p>

For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.
