			PRIVACY POLICY</span>
<p class="BODY">Updated as of July 10, 2003</p>
			<p class="BODY">StartupNation LLC is committed to protecting your privacy. 
				We created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate that commitment 
				and to ensure the confidence of visitors to our www.startupnation.com 
				Web site (the “Site”).</p>
			<p class="BODY">All information that you voluntarily submit to us will 
				be electronically delivered to our web servers located in the State 
				of Michigan in the United States. BY USING THIS SITE YOU CONSENT TO 
				THE TRANSFER OF THIS INFORMATION AND TO OUR USE OF SUCH DATA AS OUTLINED 
				IN THIS POLICY.</p>
			<p class="BODY"><br>
				<span class="HEADER">TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</span></p>
			<p class="BODY">We collect two types of information:</p>
			<p class="BODY">1. Traffic Data. Our Site automatically recognizes the 
				following non-personally identifiable information when you visit the 
				Site: (i) IP address; (ii) domain server; (iii) type of computer; 
				and (iv) type of web browser (collectively “Traffic Data”). Traffic 
				Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you, 
				but is helpful for marketing purposes and for improving your experience 
				on the Site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate 
				and to ensure the security of the data and our infrastructure.</p>
			<p class="BODY">2. Personal Information Collected. In order for us to 
				fully serve you and for you to fully access certain services that 
				we offer via the Site, we require you to provide us with information 
				that personally identifies you or your company (“Personal Information”). 
				For example, we require accurate Personal Information to, among other 
				things, sign up for our ENews Letter, submit a Coaching request, or 
				send us your feedback. Personal Information may include: (i) Contact 
				Data (such as your name, job title, occupation, phone number, company 
				name, company address, mailing and e-mail addresses); (ii) Financial 
				Data (such as your account or credit card number); (iii) Demographic 
				Data (such as your zip code, age and income). If you communicate with 
				us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards 
				or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys, any information 
				provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information. 
				Our use of this Personal Information is set forth below.</p>
			<p> <span class="BODY"><br>
				<br>
				</span><span class="HEADER">SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION IS YOUR 
				CHOICE</span></p>
			<p class="BODY">You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. 
				In such an event, you can still access and use much of the Site; however 
				you will not be able to access and use those portions of the Site 
				that require your Personal Information.</p>
			<p class="BODY"><br>
				<span class="HEADER">USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED</span></p>
			<p class="BODY">The Personal Information you enter on this Site is used 
				to respond or contact you when necessary and to provide our visitors 
				with a better Internet experience. Your Personal Information will 
				be kept in the strictest confidence. From time to time, we aggregate 
				Personal Information entered into our Site in order to identify our 
				demographic audience (collective characteristics/ behavior) and to 
				measure overall interest in specific areas of the Site. By aggregating 
				the Personal Information into a form whereby we can no longer personally 
				identify you, we are allowed to analyze how and where to best use 
				our resources without impinging on your privacy. StartupNation may 
				share such aggregated data with third parties and sales prospects, 
				and we may use this information for promotional purposes. Again, however, 
				all such aggregate information is not personally identifiable. Except 
				as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal 
				Information private and will not disclose, sell, exchange or share 
				it with third parties, without your approval, unless such disclosure 
				is necessary to:</p>
			<p class="BODY">a. Comply with the law, a court order or legal process;<br>
				b. Protect our rights or property; or<br>
				c. Enforce our Terms of Use.</p>
			<p class="BODY"><br>
				<span class="HEADER">SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</span></p>
			<p class="BODY">Your Personal Information is stored on secure web servers 
				that are not accessible by third parties. However, while we take efforts 
				to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we 
				cannot absolutely guarantee that our security measures will prevent 
				third-party “hackers” or other malfeasants from illegally obtaining 
				this information.</p>

			<p class="BODY">If you would like to unsubscribe from a particular StartupNation 
				mailing list, simply click on the opt-out link provided in the message

				responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 
				We also may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups 
				available to you. Please understand that any information that is disclosed
