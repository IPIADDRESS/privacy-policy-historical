	  <p> STARTUPNATION Â® <br>
PRIVACY POLICY </p>
	  <p>Updated as of December, 2003 </p>
	  <p>StartupNation LLC is committed to protecting your privacy. We created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate that commitment and to ensure the confidence of visitors to our <a href="http://www.startupnation.com">www.startupnation.com </a> Web site (the "Site"). </p>
	  <p>All information that you voluntarily submit to us will be electronically delivered to our web servers located in the State of Michigan in the United States. BY USING THIS SITE YOU CONSENT TO THE TRANSFER OF THIS INFORMATION AND TO OUR USE OF SUCH DATA AS OUTLINED IN THIS POLICY. </p>
	  <h2>TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED </h2>
	  <p>We collect two types of information: </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Traffic Data. Our Site automatically recognizes the following non-personally identifiable information when you visit the Site: (i) IP address; (ii) domain server; (iii) type of computer; and (iv) type of web browser (collectively "Traffic Data"). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you, but is helpful for marketing purposes and for improving your experience on the Site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate and to ensure the security of the data and our infrastructure. </li>
        <li>Personal Information Collected. In order for us to fully serve you and for you to fully access certain services that we offer via the Site, we require you to provide us with information that personally identifies you or your company ("Personal Information"). For example, we require accurate Personal Information to, among other things, sign up for our ENews Letter, submit a Coaching request, or send us your feedback. Personal Information may include: (i) Contact Data (such as your name, job title, occupation, phone number, company name, company address, mailing and e-mail addresses); (ii) Financial Data (such as your account or credit card number); (iii) Demographic Data (such as your zip code, age and income). If you communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information. Our use of this Personal Information is set forth below. SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION IS YOUR CHOICE You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. In such an event, you can still access and use much of the Site; however you will not be able to access and use those portions of the Site that require your Personal Information. </li>
      </ol>
	  <h2>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED </h2>
	  <p>The Personal Information you enter on this Site is used to respond or contact you when necessary and to provide our visitors with a better Internet experience. When you register for a StartupNation Passport, or subscribe to our Newsletter, or attend certain online events, we collect certain Personal Information from you including your name, address, email address and telephone number. From time to time, we aggregate Personal Information entered into our Site in order to identify our demographic audience (collective characteristics/ behavior) and to measure overall interest in specific areas of the Site. By aggregating the Personal Information into a form whereby we can no longer personally identify you, we are allowed to analyze how and where to best use our resources without impinging on your privacy. StartupNation may share such aggregated data with third parties and sales prospects, and we may use this information for promotional purposes. Also, StartupNation occasionally makes contact information available to select outside companies whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you. Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal Information private unless such disclosure is necessary to: </p>
	  <p>a. Comply with the law, a court order or legal process; <br>
	    b. Protect our rights or property; or <br>
	    c. Enforce our Terms of Use. </p>
	  <h2>SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION </h2>
	  <p>Your Personal Information is stored on secure web servers that are not accessible by third parties. However, while we take efforts to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot absolutely guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" or other malfeasants from illegally obtaining this information. </p>
	  <h2>ENEWSLETTER SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION </h2>
	  <p>If you would like to unsubscribe from a particular StartupNation mailing list, simply click on the opt-out link provided in the message. If you would like to subscribe to the StartupNation newsletter list, please <a href="../account/join.asp">become a member of StartupNation now</a>. </p>
	  <h2>OTHER LIMITS TO YOUR PRIVACY</h2>
	  <p> The Site contains links to other Web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We also may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available to you. Please understand that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. We have no control over its use and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information. </p>
	  <h2>RIGHT TO CHANGE PRIVACY POLICY </h2>
	  <p>We reserve the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, change, update or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting such change, update or modification on the Site. Any such change, update or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the Site. </p>
	  <h2>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY </h2>
	  <p>This Site is not intended for children under the age of 18. If you are under 18 you must ask a parent for permission prior to submitting any information to this Site. </p>
	  <h2>CONTACT FOR PRIVACY INQUIRIES</h2>
