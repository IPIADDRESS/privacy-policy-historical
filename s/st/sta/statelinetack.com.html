	<p></p><h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<b>PetSmart Values Your Trust</b><br>
        We value your trust -- so we have taken great care to inform you in this
        Policy what we do and do not do with information that you provide us
        in the course of using our website, purchasing our products or using
        our services.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Your Privacy is Important</b><br>
        We use our best efforts to maintain the personal information you give
        to us in a secure, safe and responsible manner within the PetSmart Family.
        Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, the personal information
        we collect will not be sold, rented or leased and will only be shared
        within the PetSmart Family, which consists of divisions, subsidiaries
        and affiliates of PetSmart, Inc. (such as PetSmart of Canada, State Line
        Tack stores and/or catalog, PetSmart.com, PetSmart pet catalogs and PETsHOTEL),
        as well as PetSmart Charities, and those service providers that are in
        PetSmart stores, such as the veterinary (Banfield, The Pet Hospital)
        and grooming services, and adoption agencies. We may combine the information
        you provide us from these different sources.<p></p>
      <p><b>Shop Safe Guarantee</b><br>
        We are very confident in the security of Internet transactions, therefore
          we offer our Safe Shopping Guarantee. If unauthorized charges are made
          to your card as a result of shopping at PetSmart.com we will cover
          your liabilities. (In the event of unauthorized usage, you must first
          contact your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting
          rules and procedures.)<br>
        <br>
        Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, federal law protects all of your credit
        card purchases. In the very unlikely event that your credit card is stolen
        over the Internet, your maximum liability is $50. If your credit card
        company holds you responsible for this amount, PetSmart.com will reimburse
        you up to $50.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Best Technology Available</b><br>
        PetSmart.com takes every precaution to ensure that your credit card information
        is secure. We utilize SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), the industry standard
        security protocol. All of your ordering information is encrypted using
        this secure server for maximum security.<br>
        <br>
        We also use Apache's Secure Server technology, which safeguards your
        online order by requesting authentication for server access, encrypting
        private information, and protecting the integrity of your data. We also
        maintain a certificate with Verisign that serves as anelectronic substitute
        for your signature.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Customer Value and Satisfaction</b><br>
        The PetSmart Family seeks to be the most trusted, caring, complete, exciting
        and value oriented source for all your pets needs throughout its life
        a Total Lifetime of Care. To accomplish this, we offer wonderful products
        and services and occasionally team up with our suppliers to provide other
        offers of value to you.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Your Choice</b><br>
        It is up to you whether you provide us with your personal information
        by participating in any of the activities mentioned in this Privacy Policy.
        If you choose to participate, your personal information will be carefully
        handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Personal Information</b><br>
        When you purchase our products and/or services in our stores, through
        our catalogs, over the phone and on-line, as well as when you participate
        in our surveys, occasional sweepstakes or promotions and/or PetPerks
        program, you provide us with information. Depending upon what information
        you provide to us and whether, and where, you purchase products and/or
        services, the information we receive may include your name, mailing,
        billing and/or shipping address, telephone number, driver's license number,
        birth date, form of payment, e-mail address, pet information, product
        and service preferences, what you purchased and where (i.e., store location,
        catalog and/or website). If you use a credit or debit card or pay by
        check, the information we receive will include your account number and
        your form of payment. The PetSmart Family uses the information you provide
        to service your account, to ship an order to you, to provide warranty
        service on products and/or services you purchased, and to personalize
        your experience with the PetSmart Family to provide a Total Lifetime
        of Care for your pet(s).<br>
        <br>
        <b>Security of Your Transactions</b><br>
        The PetSmart Family has policies and procedures in place to ensure that
        information you share with us is handled in a safe, secure and responsible
        manner. We use encryption and other types of technology to reasonably
        protect and safeguard your personal information and transactions, whether
        your purchases are on-line, through our catalogs, in our stores and/or
        from our service providers. We never display your full credit card information.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Product and Service Preferences</b><br>
        You have the option within the website, catalog or store, or when ordering
        by phone, to provide us with information about your product and/or service
        preferences, pet information or other interests. You may also provide
        us with product and service preference information when you participate
        in the PetPerks program, sweepstakes, surveys and questionnaires of various
        members of the PetSmart Family. We use this information within the PetSmart
        Family to improve the level of customization in our stores, catalogs,
        services and website and to provide better recommendations for you and
        your pet.<br>
        <br>
        <b>E-mail and Direct Mail Offers</b><br>
        To offer you a customized Total Lifetime of Care for your pet, we may
        also use your mailing, shipping and/or billing address or e-mail address
        you have provided us to send you special offers from time to time that
        would be of interest to you.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Surveys</b><br>
        From time to time, we may randomly contact customers about participating
        in a survey about our products, services and/or website. Your feedback
        helps us identify customer needs, levels of satisfaction, and improve
        and/or develop new products and services for you and your pet. These
        surveys are always voluntary.<br>
        <br>
        <b>PetSmart Family Contests, Promotions, Advertisements and Other Opportunities</b><br>
        If you enter a PetSmart Family contest and/or sweepstakes, we will ask
        for your name, mailing address, e-mail address and any other information
        relevant to the particular offer. Unless otherwise noted on the offer,
        the information you provide us will be kept within the PetSmart Family.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Contests, Promotions, Advertisements and Other Opportunities Provided
        With Select Third Parties</b><br>
        PetSmart may run contests, sweepstakes, advertisements and other promotional
        offers with select companies outside of the PetSmart Family on our website,
        by e-mail, in our stores, through our catalogs or by direct mail. When
        you choose to participate in these contests, sweepstakes or promotional
        offers, you may be asked to give the third parties your personal information.
        These businesses operate independently from the PetSmart Family. Any
        personal information that is given to them is at your option and is not
        controlled by our Privacy Policy. To avoid confusion, we will identify
        these businesses as independent from the PetSmart Family. We encourage
        you to read the privacy policies of these businesses if you should have
        any concerns about how they will treat your personal information.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Catalogs</b><br>
        The PetSmart Family has two catalogs from which you may order: State
        Line Tack and PetSmart (formerly R.C. Steele Pet Supplies). When you
        purchase products from these catalogs, the personal information you provide
        us to complete the transaction is collected. Occasionally, we make our
        catalog customer list available to carefully selected companies whose
        products and/or services may be of interest to you. However, we respect
        your privacy and, if you prefer your name to be withheld from such companies,
        please contact us as noted below in the Opt Out section.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Research Providers, Shipping Companies, and Consultants</b><br>
        PetSmart hires selective companies to do product and service research,
        deliver merchandise you have purchased from us, help us be a better,
        more effective and efficient company, and/or develop new and /or better
        products and/or services for you and your pet. We also share sales information
        with third parties to properly process services and returns, place new
        supplier orders and perform other administrative functions.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Legal Requirements</b><br>
        On rare occasions, we may be required to disclose personal information
        pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or as
        required by applicable laws. Also, if the ownership of all or a part
        of a business within the PetSmart Family were to change, customer information
        pertinent to that business's operations would likely be transferred to,
        or licensed for use by, the new owner.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Change Happens</b><br>
        The PetSmart Family is continually improving its services, offerings,
        and products to you. This includes adding new functionality and features
        to its websites, stores and/or catalogs. Because of these changes, changes
        in technology and/or the law, this Privacy Policy will change from time
        to time. We encourage you to review it each time you visit one of our
