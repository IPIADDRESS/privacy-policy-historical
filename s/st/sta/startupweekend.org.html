<p dir="ltr"><b>Information automatically collected</b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may automatically log information about you and your computer or mobile device when you access our Site.

<h1 id="cookies" dir="ltr"><b>Cookies and Similar Technologies</b></h1>
<p dir="ltr"><b>What are cookies and similar technologies?</b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may collect personal information using “<b>cookies</b>“. Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Site; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Site, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites or online services.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>Pixel tags</b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also use technologies that function similarly to cookies called pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) to track the actions of users on our Site. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags can be used, for example, to measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Site, so that we can better understand how users interact with our Site.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>How we use cookies and similar technologies</b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Site may collect personal information using the following types of cookies and similar technologies and process that data for the purposes set out below: </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These cookies and similar technologies collect personal information, such as unique IDs, IP addresses, device information, OS/browser type, and other similar data, that are used to create information about traffic to our Site and how users use our Site.

</td>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These cookies and similar technologies are used for “retargeting” and for interest-based advertising. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest-based advertising includes various parties and services providers, including third party data controllers, engaged in the processing of personal data in connection with personalized advertising. These parties may collect personal information such as unique IDs, IP addresses, device information, OS/browser type, and other similar data, as well as information about the ads you see and view to develop and assess aspects of a profile about you to deliver more relevant advertisements and offers, and determine whether and how ads you see are effective. These third parties may augment your profile with demographic and other preferences data derived from these observations, and may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you complete a purchase for a good or services you were shown in an advertisement. These parties may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also use ad “retargeting” so that you can see advertisements from us on other websites. For example, we may share with Google certain personal information (such as unique user ID) in connection with advertising provided through Google’s “<a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6379332?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6296507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Customer Match</a>” service. These technologies and the data they process may be used by advertisers to deliver ads on their services based on content you have viewed on our Sites, or that we believe you would be interested in, for example, based on Events you have attended or products/services you have purchased from us. These tracking technologies may also help prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, and help us understand whether you have interacted with or viewed ads we’ve delivered to you. This collection and ad targeting takes place both on our Sites and on third-party websites (e.g. Google) that participate in the ad network, e.g. any advertisements delivered by that ad network on a third party website. </span></p>
