<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <p>In this policy, "us", "we" or "our" means Stan Entertainment Pty Ltd (ABN 94 168 856 924) and its related bodies corporate (<strong>Stan Group</strong>). Your privacy matters to us whether you are new to our service or are a long time user.  Please read this policy carefully as its set out the way we handle your "personal information".</p>
<p>We are bound by the Australian Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ("Act").</p>
<h2>What is personal information</h2>
<p>When used in this policy, the term "personal information" has the meaning given to it in the Act. In general terms, it is any information that can be used to personally identify you. This may include your name, age, gender, postcode and contact details (including phone numbers and email addresses) and possibly financial information, including your credit card information.</p>
<h2>What personal information do we collect and hold</h2>
<p>We may collect the following types of personal information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>name;</li>
  <li>mailing or street address;</li>
  <li>email address;</li>
  <li>telephone number and other contact details;</li>
  <li>age or your date of birth;</li>
  <li>credit card information;</li>
  <li>details of the products and services you have purchased from us or which you have enquired about, together with any additional information necessary to deliver those products and services and to respond to your enquiries;</li>
  <li>any additional information relating to you that you provide to us directly through our websites or indirectly through use of our website or online presence through our representatives or otherwise, or through other websites or accounts from which you permit us to collect information;</li>
  <li>information you provide to us through our service centre, customer surveys or visits by our representatives from time to time;</li>
  <li>any other personal information which may be required in order to facilitate your dealings with us.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cookies and beacons</h2>
<p>We may also collect additional information about your interaction with Stan websites/services/products. For example, we use website analytics tools on our websites to retrieve information about your usage of Stan services. We also use technologies, such as cookies and web beacons (described below), to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on our sites and services. Additionally, we receive certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring website addresses. We generally use this information to report statistics, analyse trends, administer our services, diagnose problems, gather demographic and behavioural information and target and improve the quality of our products and services. To the extent this information does not constitute or is not associated with personal information because it does not identify you or anyone else, the Australian Privacy Principles do not apply and we may use this information for any purpose and by any means whatsoever.</p>
<p>We may also use cookies to enable us to collect data which may include personal information. When you access our website, we may send a "cookie" (which is a small summary file containing a unique ID number placed by a web server) to your device. This enables us to recognise your device each time you visit our website or use our application, without bothering you with a request to register or log-in. It also helps us keep track of and personalise products or services you view and your preferences, so that we can send you news about those products or services.</p>
<p>Our websites, products and services may contain electronic images known as "web beacons" - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to assist in delivering cookies on our sites and allow us to count users who have visited.  We may include web beacons on all webpages on our website/products/services in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. We may also employ web beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the operations of our websites. We prohibit web beacons on our websites from being used by third parties to collect or access your personal information.</p>
<p>Cookies must be enabled in your browser or device in order to use Stan services.</p>
<p>Anonymous data which we collect about your interaction with Stan services may be used by us for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or may be sold or otherwise provided by us to third parties including our partners, clients, shareholder and service providers for purposes including (but not limited to) data-matching, analysis, selling aggregated anonymous data via advertising exchanges, conducting launch surveys, and modelling.</p>
<p>When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mails from us, we may use web beacons (described above), customised links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you with more focused e-mail communications or other information.</p>
<h2>How we collect personal information</h2>
<p>We collect your personal information directly from you unless it is unreasonable or impractical to do so.</p>
<p>We do this in various ways including:</p>
<ul>

  <li>when you register your interest to access a free trial or to access Stan services;</li>

<p>We may send you direct marketing communications and information about products and services that we consider may be of interest to you. These communications may be sent in various forms, including mail, SMS or email, in accordance with applicable marketing laws, such as the Spam Act 2004 (Cth). If you indicate a preference for a method of communication, we will endeavour to use that method whenever practical to do so.</p>
<p>In addition, at any time, you may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by contacting us (details below) or by using the opt-out facilities provided (e.g. an unsubscribe link). We will then ensure that your name is removed from our mailing list. We do not provide your personal information to other organisations for the purposes of direct marketing unless expressly authorised by you.</p>

<p>You may request access to any personal information we hold about you at any time by contacting us (details below). Where we hold information that you are entitled to access, we will try to provide you with suitable means of accessing it (for example, by mailing or emailing it to you). We will not charge for simply making a request and will not charge for making any corrections to your personal information. If you make an access request, we will ask you to verify your identity. There may be instances where we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold. For example, we may need to refuse access if granting access would interfere with the privacy of others, or if it would result in a breach of confidentiality. If that happens, we will give you written reasons for any refusal.</p>
<p>If you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then you may request us to amend it. We will consider if the information requires amendment. If we do not agree that there are grounds for amendment, then we will add a note to the personal information stating that you disagree with it.</p>
<p>We request that you keep your information as current as possible so that we may continue to improve our service to you.</p>
