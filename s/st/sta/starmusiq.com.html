<h5>Last Updated: December 12, 2014</h5>
<p>At NewTamilHits, we take the privacy of our users very seriously. This   policy spells out the information we collect and how we put it to use.   Please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@NewTamilHits.com?Subject=Privacy%20Policy">support@NewTamilHits.com</a> if you have any questions about this Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Terms Of Service</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to our <a href="http://www.NewTamilHits.com/terms.asp">Terms of Service</a> for explanation of all legal terms and provisions, limitations of liability, exclusions of warranties, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Information Collection &amp; Use</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NewTamilHits requires users to register for the service and provide   personal information including but not limited to the user's name, zip   code and email address. NewTamilHits uses this information to establish and   deliver service to the individual. NewTamilHits may use this information to   contact registered users to notify them of product and service updates,   provide instruction, and to deliver other service related information.   NewTamilHits may also contact users to request additional information and   feedback. NewTamilHits may employ companies and people to perform tasks on its   behalf, and will need to share personal information with these agents to   establish and deliver service to the individual. NewTamilHits's agents do not   receive any right to use personal information beyond what is necessary   to perform these tasks.</p>
<p>NewTamilHits will not disclose registration information to third   parties, including, but not limited to, companies affiliated with NewTamilHits,   without your consent or as otherwise stated in this privacy policy. If   at some point NewTamilHits sells all or a portion of its assets, customer   information is one of those assets that would be transferred or acquired   by a third party; the third party would then have the right to continue   using the personal information as set forth in this policy. For more   information see NewTamilHits's Privacy Policy Changes section below.</p>
<p>NewTamilHits may release or exchange personal information if required to   do so to comply with applicable law or to enforce its rights or   agreements or prevent fraud or reduce credit risk. In addition, NewTamilHits   may contact you to inform you of updates or new features. If you wish to   be removed from such secondary mailings you may do so by the means   provided in the email.</p>
<p>NewTamilHits may automatically collect and analyze information regarding   the use of NewTamilHits's services and NewTamilHits site activity. Information   collected may include but is not limited to web site traffic volume,   frequency of visits, type and time of transactions, type of browser and   operating system, etc. This information is logged to help diagnose   technical problems, administer the site, and improve the quality and   types of service delivered. NewTamilHits may also collect, track and analyze   information that does not personally identify a user in aggregate form.   This aggregate data will be used at NewTamilHits's discretion and may be shared   with third parties, but with no personally identifiable information   attached. Registered users will be using the site to host relationship   data. Relationship data sent to NewTamilHits servers by the user will remain   the property of the user. NewTamilHits will not review, share, distribute or   reference such data except as may be required to provide the requested   NewTamilHits services, or as provided in the NewTamilHits Terms of Use Agreement, or   as may be required by law.</p>
<p>If a user elects to use NewTamilHits's invite service for reaching a   person via the NewTamilHits site, we will generate an automatic email that is   sent to them. We will automatically send this person an email inviting   them to visit the site if they are not a user or if they are a user we   will send that an email to ask them to visit the site or respond to the   invite. If the individual does not respond we do not send any reminder   emails. We do not store this information for public use. The emails are   for the sole purpose of notifying individuals about upcoming sports   events.</p>
<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as   zip code or email), or if a user no longer desires our service, we   provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally   identifiable information. If not easily available online, this can be   done by emailing our customer support at <a href="mailto:admin@NewTamilHits.com?Subject=Privacy%20Policy">support@NewTamilHits.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
