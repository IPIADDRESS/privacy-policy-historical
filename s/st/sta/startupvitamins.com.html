        <p>
            <strong>6. DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTS</strong><br>
            Whilst many component parts of our Products are standard, all Products available for purchase are described
            on their specific design page on our Site. We always try to represent each design as accurately as possible
            via photography and copy points provided by designers, artists or photographers.</p>
        <p>We have a policy of continuous Product development so we can provide you with what we consider the best

            their price, packaging and any Service associated at any time, without prior notice. Before ordering, we
            thus invite you to have a close look at the Product description and design. We use our best efforts to
            provide you with the best images and description, but unfortunately cannot guarantee that colors and details
            in website images are 100% accurate representations of the product, and sizes might in some cases be
            approximate.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>7. PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS</strong><br>
            Your order represents an offer to us to purchase a Product which is accepted by us once we have sent you an
            email order confirmation. Any Products on the same order which we have not confirmed in an order
            confirmation e-mail do not form part of that contract.</p>

        <p>Startupvitamins.com shall under no circumstances be held liable for any special losses due to specific
            circumstances of the customer, indirect or consequential losses or wasted expenditure.
            Orders are placed and received exclusively via the Site. Before ordering from us, it is User's
            responsibility to check and determine full ability to receive the Products. Correct address and post
            code/zip code, up-to-date telephone number and e-mail address are absolutely necessary to ensure successful
            delivery of your Products. All information asked on the checkout page must be filled in precisely and
            accurately. Startupvitamins.com will not be responsible for missed delivery because of a wrong delivery
            address or an inappropriate phone number. Should you like to ask for a change in the delivery address,
            notify change in a phone number or any other special requirements, please contact Startupvitamins.com via
            e-mail.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>8. DELIVERY</strong><br>
            We deliver to most places in the world. Delivery prices may vary depending on delivery location, and
            additional charges may be added to the order for remote or difficult to access locations that require
            special attention. Standard delivery charges are shown on our checkout page; however we reserve the right to
            advise you of any additional delivery charges that apply to your specific delivery address.
            Delivery lead time may vary however we aim to supply products within the U.S. within 10 working days of
            acceptance of order. Products supplied outside the U.S. will normally be delivered within 20 working days of
            acceptance of order. We can not guarantee delivery dates and accept no responsibility, apart from advising
            you of any known delay, for products that are delivered after the estimated delivery date.
            This is only an average estimation, and some delivery can take longer, or alternatively be delivered much
            faster. All delivery estimates given at the time of placing and confirming order are subject to change. In
            any case, we will do our best to contact you and advise you of all changes. We try our best to make delivery
            of your product as simple for you as possible.
            Depending on the location for the delivery, different carriers and services might be used to deliver your
            order, but all will be well vetted and of proven reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>9. RELEASE</strong><br>

            subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of

            We will ask you to provide your name, company name, shipping and billing address, phone number, email
            address, and payment details, and other information that you share with us during checkout. In addition, we
            may also ask you for your country of residence and/or your organization’s country of operation, so we can
            comply with applicable laws and regulations. This data is used for billing purposes, to fulfill your orders,

            encounter a problem when processing your order, your personal information may be used to contact you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon starting to use our Services or when you subscribe to our newsletter, we may process your email address

        <p>
            <strong>2. LEGAL GROUNDS FOR DATA PROCESSING</strong><br>
            We only collect and process your personal data where we have lawful basis. Legal grounds for the processing
            of your personal data vary depending on the specific group of data and the purposes for processing it. Note
            that we may be processing the same personal data for several purposes simultaneously and, respectively, on
            more than one legal ground.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Contract</u>. Most of the time the legal basis for processing your personal data is the contractual
            relationship between us, which is concluded once you agree to our Terms of Service.
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Legal obligation</u>. In some cases we process personal data on basis of legal obligations, imposed on us
            by applicable law, such as financial and tax reporting obligations, or if we have to respond to legal
            process.
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Legitimate interests</u>. Processing of some of your personal data is necessary for pursuing our
            legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of third parties, always ensuring that such processing
            shall not outweigh your rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your data for marketing purposes
            based on our legitimate interest of developing and improving our business. Other legitimate interests
            include maintaining Service to meet the needs of our users and clients, advertising to make our Service
            freely available for users, detecting and preventing fraud, abuse, security and technical issues with the
            Service, fulfilling obligations to our partners, enforcing legal claims, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Consent</u>. When you subscribe to our blog or newsletter, we will send you information, for example, our
            news, promotions or offers, based on your consent. Note that you have the right to withdraw your consent at
            any time and unsubscribe by using the unsubscribe link provided in the e-mail or by contacting us.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>3. SHARING PERSONAL DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES</strong><br>
            In order to provide you with our services, we work with third parties with whom we may share personal data
            to support these services. Your personal data may be shared with third parties who provide hosting and
            server co-location services, communications and content delivery networks, data and cyber security services,
            billing and payment processing services, fraud detection and prevention services, web analytics, email
            distribution and monitoring services, session recording services, marketing services, our legal and
            financial advisors, among others (together – “Third Party Service Providers”). The Third Party Service
            Providers may only receive the minimum amount of personal data necessary, depending on their particular
            roles and purposes in facilitating and enhancing our Services and business, and may only use it for such
            purposes. We will only share personal data to Third Party Service Providers that have undertaken to comply
            with obligations set out in applicable data protection laws.
            We remain responsible for the processing of personal data carried out by Third Party Service Providers that
            we have engaged with for respective data processing in accordance with applicable laws.
            In certain circumstances, we may also be required to share information with third parties to conform to
            legal requirements or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities as well as to protect our, or a
            third party’s, lawful interests.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>4. RETENTION PERIODS</strong><br>
            We may retain your personal data for as long as needed to provide you our Services and as long as any of the
            above-mentioned legal basis for data processing exist.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>5. DATA SUBJECT’S RIGHTS</strong><br>
            If you are located in the European Economic Area, in accordance with European Union data protection
            regulations, you have certain rights with respect to your personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
            You have the right to request access to your personal data and to correct, amend or delete your personal
            data by reaching us using the contact information provided below. Furthermore, if you believe that we have
            unlawfully processed your personal data, you have the right to submit a complaint to the contact information
            provided below, or to your respective data protection supervisory authority.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>6. INFORMATION SECURITY</strong><br>
            We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect the
            confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data. Unfortunately, no data transmission or
            storage system is guaranteed to be 100% secure, therefore we cannot guarantee absolute security of
            information. We encourage you to take care of the personal data in your possession that you process online.
            All of Startup Vitamins authorized personnel involved in the processing of your personal data have committed
            themselves to confidentiality obligations and shall not access or otherwise process your personal data
            without your authorization if it's not for the purpose of providing you our Services.
            In the event that we experience a personal data breach, we will notify you in accordance with the
            obligations set out in applicable laws.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>7. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</strong><br>
            All the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by Printful Inc., its affiliated companies
            and subsidiaries around the world for the provision of our Services as described in this Privacy Policy.
            When we transfer your information globally we will take necessary measures to ensure adequate protection of
            your information.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>8. PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</strong><br>
            We may occasionally amend this Privacy Policy, for example in cases when we introduce new services or new
            features. The amendments to this Privacy Policy enter into force and are applied from the moment they have
            been uploaded to this page.
            Therefore, we encourage you to check this page from time to time. By continuing to use our Services or
            otherwise providing personal data to us, after the amendments to this policy have been implemented, you
            agree to the updated terms of Privacy Policy.
        </p>
