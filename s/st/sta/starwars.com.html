                               YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS ACTIVITY. IF YOU ARE OVER 13
                               BUT NOT AN ADULT YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR
                               GUARDIAN'S CONSENT TO COLLECT YOUR PRIZE OR RECEIVE
                               YOUR BENEFIT. We use the information you provide when placing an
                               order, entering a game, entering a contest or sweepstake or when we
                               complete an order and/or fulfill a prize. We use return e-mail addresses
                               to answer the e-mail that we receive, and we may use return e-mail to
                               communicate with you or to send you other information. If you are under
                               13 (with your parent's or guardian's consent), or if you are over 13 but
                               not an adult, the information collected for contests or sweepstakes
                               include your first name, e-mail address and your parent's e-mail
                               address and, if you win, before your prize is collected, your parent or
                               guardian is sent an e-mail informing them of your award and explaining
                               the nature and terms and conditions of the sweepstakes. Your parent or
                               guardian will then have a chance to "opt out" of collecting your prize on
                               your behalf, in which case the prize will not be awarded.

                               visitor scores or to help you keep track of where you left off in a game.
                               "Cookies" may include the type of browser software you use to access
                               the Internet (i.e. Internet Explorer, Netscape 3.0,); type of operating
                               system (i.e. Windows 95, Mac, etc.), and/or the domain name of your

</p><p>
                               An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer
                               whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that
                               "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP
                               address. When you request a page from our Web site, our servers log
                               your IP address. An IP address does not contain personally identifiable
                               information. Except with respect to our e-commerce activities (e.g.,
                               on-line purchases), we do not link IP addresses with personally
                               identifiable information. We may use your IP address to help diagnose
                               problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP
                               address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to
                               gather broad demographic information. We may also collect information
                               about your browser software and/or machine type (e.g., Windows, Mac,
                               Unix, etc.).

                               If you are under 13 years old, ask your parent or guardian BEFORE

                               address or e-mail address. You do not have to give any personal
                               information about yourself. Remember, if you are under 13 you must
                               have your parent or guardian make any changes to information given to
                               us in the past or to update your profile. If you are ever unsure about

                               parental notice. If a visitor indicates that he/she is under the age of 13,
                               he/she will be asked to supply a parent's or guardian's e-mail address.
                               In this case, the parent or guardian will receive an e-mail message
                               containing instructions on how to enable the child's registration and until
                               the parent or guardian enables the child's registration, the account is

                               within a reasonable time, we delete this information from our records.
                               We also may collect this information to respond to a specific request
                               from a child under 13. Once we respond to a request from a child under

                               collect any more personal information from your child. However, if you
                               ask us to delete your child's information that is necessary to participate
                               in our activities, we may have to ask your child not to participate in our
                               activities.
