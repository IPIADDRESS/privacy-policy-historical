This Privacy Policy also explains the choices that you can make about the way your information is collected and used. It is available for you to review on our homepage and at least on every page where we have requested personally identifiable information from kids under 13. BY USING THIS WEB SITE, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ASSENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. If you do not agree with any term in this Privacy Policy, do not use this Web site. </p><p> KIDS: Please check with your parents before entering any information on this or any other Web site. See our "SPECIAL NOTE TO KIDS" below. </p><p><b>PARENTS:</b></p><p> We are committed to protecting children's privacy. We developed this Web site to be an enjoyable experience for customers of all ages, including kids under 13. We recognize that some younger children may not understand some of the information contained on this Web site or how this Web site operates. PLEASE BE SURE TO CAUTION YOUR CHILD UNDER 13 AGAINST PROVIDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ONLINE PRIOR TO THE WEB SITE OPERATOR OBTAINING YOUR CONSENT. It is our policy not to collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 without first obtaining a parent's or guardian's verifiable permission. See our "SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS OF KIDS UNDER 13" below. </p><p> Please discuss this Privacy Policy with your children so that they will better understand how to use this Web site and the information they may be asked to provide. We strongly believe that providing our visitors with accurate and adequate notice about the Web site will lead to informed choices and decisions about how to use the Web site, as well as protecting our users' privacy. </p><p><b>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</b></p><p> Generally, we limit the collection of information to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (such as, first name, age, state or country) and we will not require you to provide more information than is necessary to participate in any of our Web site activities. This information is collected so that visitors can participate in activities (such as, receiving our e-mail newsletter[s], building homepages, saving game designs and scores, participating in our question polls) without giving out unnecessary personal information other than an e-mail address. </p><p> However, in some areas on our Web site personally identifiable information is asked for and collected (for example, online sweepstakes, online promotions and the registered area of this site) and you may not be able to access those areas or participate in certain activities without giving the necessary personal information. Where we request additional information from you in connection with a Web site's activity such information may be personal. Whenever we request that you submit such information, we will endeavor to notify you of our intended use of the information, as more specifically discussed below. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE, AND CAN DECLINE TO PROVIDE, ANY REQUESTED INFORMATION AT ANY TIME. HOWEVER, IF YOU DECLINE, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES AT THIS WEB SITE. </p><p> The types of information collected at this Web site may include: </p><p></p><ul><li>Contact information, such as full name, e-mail address and mailing address. <p></p></li><li>Financial information and/or Credit/Debit Card data (for, by way of example, online store purchase information, third party links). Personal identifiers, such as screen names, URLs (for personalized homepages) and passwords. <p></p></li><li>Demographic information, such as date of birth, age, profile, gender, state and country. <p></p></li><li>Internet Protocol (IP) Information, such as your IP address and browser type. <p></p></li><li>Information collected by or held in "cookies." </li></ul><p><b>HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION?:</b></p><p><b>Registration:</b></p><p> If this Web site has a registration procedure, our Web site's registration form requires users to give us contact information, unique identifiers, and demographic information. All registration information is submitted to us on a voluntary basis. We may also ask registered members to tell us how they found out about us. Once you register, we use customer contact information from the registration form to contact you, to send you information about our company and/or to give you updates on products and/or services. You may register on our Web site and choose not to receive information and updates by unchecking the relevant box on the registration form. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, GET YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE YOU PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION. </p><p><b>Online Promotions:</b></p><p> We or our advertisers, licensees and/or other business partners may have special online promotions which feature products or services related to our business activities. TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY PROMOTION, YOU MUST 13 YEARS OR OLDER (unless otherwise specified by the promotion's rules and regulations). IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS ACTIVITY. IF YOU ARE OVER 13 BUT NOT AN ADULT YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT TO COLLECT YOUR PRIZE OR RECEIVE YOUR BENEFIT. You may be asked to provide an e-mail address or screen name, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. For other promotions, we may request your name and home address in order to send you products or information by regular mail. The specific rules and regulations governing the particular promotion will vary and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those rules and regulations. </p><p><b>Online Contests and Sweepstakes:</b></p><p> We or our advertisers, licensees and/or other business partners may sponsor contests or sweepstakes which may be entered online. The specific rules and regulations governing the particular contest or sweepstakes will vary and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those rules and regulations. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS ACTIVITY. IF YOU ARE OVER 13 BUT NOT AN ADULT YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT TO COLLECT YOUR PRIZE OR RECEIVE YOUR BENEFIT. We use the information you provide when placing an order, entering a game, entering a contest or sweepstake or when we complete an order and/or fulfill a prize. We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail that we receive, and we may use return e-mail to communicate with you or to send you other information. If you are under 13 (with your parent's or guardian's consent), or if you are over 13 but not an adult, the information collected for contests or sweepstakes include your first name, e-mail address and your parent's e-mail address and, if you win, before your prize is collected, your parent or guardian is sent an e-mail informing them of your award and explaining the nature and terms and conditions of the sweepstakes. Your parent or guardian will then have a chance to "opt out" of collecting your prize on your behalf, in which case the prize will not be awarded. </p><p><b>Collecting and Sharing Data:</b></p><p> We sometimes collect information to find out how people found our Web site, which pages they visited, and how long they stayed. In addition, we may aggregate demographic, profile and non-personal information you provide and use aggregate information to better design our Web site and to improve our marketing strategy and our product offerings. If you are 13 or older, we may share this demographic and profile information with our advertisers, licensees and/or other business partners with whom we link to permit them to contact you with information about certain products and services. </p><p><b>Opinions:</b></p><p> We may ask for your opinion from time to time. You may send us questions or comments, which may require personal information for a response. However, please note that we have a policy against accepting unsolicited material, so do not submit any unsolicited or unique creative ideas, drawings or other materials, and refer to our policy on unsolicited submissions in our Terms of Use. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE YOU CAN PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION. </p><p><b>Personalized Homepages:</b></p><p> You may be able to build a personalized fan homepage from one of our fan homepage-building programs (e.g., at www.starwars.com). You will have to submit your e-mail address and password to log-in. HOWEVER, YOU MUST BE OVER 13 TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS ACTIVITY. </p><p><b>Mailing lists:</b></p><p> Where appropriate, the option to allow us to share certain information with some of our promotional partners may be provided, or the option for you to elect not to have us share certain information may be provided. You always have the right to unsubscribe from any mailing lists we may maintain, or to delete personally identifiable electronic information we have collected online about you. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS ACTIVITY. </p><p><b>E-mail and Newsletters:</b></p><p> We may offer fully interactive registered email services. We also provide fun and exciting newsletters, such as the Homing Beacon, and the Padawan Post to tell our users about all of our interesting films, licensed products and services. Our newsletters may include links to any independently-operated Web site. Although we do not provide without parental permission any personally identifiable information about kids under 13 to any "independently-operated Web site" (that is, a Web site not owned, controlled and operated by us), such Web Site(s) may solicit personally identifiable information from kids under 13, please be aware that we don't control and are not responsible for their actions, privacy policy(ies) or terms of use. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN EITHER OF THESE ACTIVITIES. </p><p><b>Purchasing Items:</b></p><p> Purchasing items from various online stores may require the giving of personally identifiable information (such as, name, credit card information). IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS ACTIVITY. </p><p><b>Cookies:</b></p><p> We use a software technology called "cookies" to collect non-personally identifiable information. Cookies are pieces of information that we may place on your computer to help "personalize" your visit to the Web site and to allow you to enter our Web site without having to remember and enter any special passwords. For example, a "cookie" will allow us to remember certain things about you, such as your screen name, to track visitor scores or to help you keep track of where you left off in a game. "Cookies" may include the type of browser software you use to access the Internet (i.e. Internet Explorer, Netscape 3.0,); type of operating system (i.e. Windows 95, Mac, etc.), and/or the domain name of your Internet service provider. Except with respect to our e-commerce activities (e.g., on-line purchases), we do not link your non-personally identifiable information in "cookies" with personally identifiable information about you. </p><p> In addition, some companies place or provide banner ads on this Web site that might also place cookies. Each of these companies use this cookie information according to their own privacy and security policies. You can find and evaluate these companies at the end of this Privacy Policy as 'Appendix A,' and we will keep this list updated. </p><p><b>Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out:</b></p><p> If you are over the age of 12 you could receive communications from us or from third parties. In that case, you may: (1) opt-out of receiving communications from us by selecting or deselecting the optional e-mail from us on the "Your Account" page to control the messages you receive from us; and/or (2) opt-in or opt-out of receiving communications from third-party sponsors or promotional partners at the time of registration. If you elect to receive these communications, we will transmit the information that you provide to this third party. Note, however, that each third party is governed by a different privacy policy and may have a different method than our Web site to opt-out of future communications. </p><p><b>IP Address and Machine Type:</b></p><p> An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from our Web site, our servers log your IP address. An IP address does not contain personally identifiable information. Except with respect to our e-commerce activities (e.g., on-line purchases), we do not link IP addresses with personally identifiable information. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. We may also collect information about your browser software and/or machine type (e.g., Windows, Mac, Unix, etc.). </p><p><b>Links:</b></p><p> We do create links to the Web sites of other parties. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, GET YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE LINKING TO OTHER WEB SITES. Independently-operated Web sites are not associated with or authorized by us and may also have links leading to this Web site. We cannot control any of these links and are not responsible for any content appearing on Web sites linked to or from our Web site, or for any personal information gathered at those independently-operated Web sites. </p><p><b>Bumper Pages:</b></p><p> We sometimes provide a "bumper page" when linking from our Web site to an independently-operated Web site, which lets you know you are going to an independently-operated Web site and reminds them not to give out information online without their parent's permission. </p><p><b>Data Integrity and Security:</b></p><p> We take reasonable precautions to keep your personal information secure. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. In cases where the information is not stored on separate computer servers, it is only accessible from specific computers within our control. We have and will continue to take reasonable measures to assure the security and accuracy of all information our visitors share with us. Our efforts include procedures designed to avoid any unauthorized access, alteration, misuse or disclosure of personally identifiable information. </p><p><b>CHANGES:</b></p><p><b>Our changes:</b></p><p> We reserve the right to change or remove this privacy policy at our discretion. If we decide to change our privacy policy we will post those changes here. We encourage you to visit this area frequently to stay informed. We will tell you via e-mail if we make any material changes in how we collect, use or we wish to share your child's information in any manner not previously authorized by you. We will require third parties with whom we have written agreements involving the sharing of personally identifiable information of kids under 13 to agree to protect the privacy of that information in accordance with applicable law. </p><p><b>Your changes:</b></p><p> This Web site gives users options for changing and modifying information previously provided. If you are a registered visitor, you are welcome to view, change or delete your registration information at any time, or to update the contact information we have for you or to inform us that you do not want to receive new product or other information from us. Simply go to the registration page of this Web site using the same computer from which you initially registered. When the welcome screen appears, you can click on "delete or add". Kids under 13 cannot change registration information, only the parent or guardian can do that. Parents should follow the procedure that they used to enable their child's registration to change any information at any time. </p><p><b>SPECIAL NOTE TO KIDS:</b></p><p> If you are under 13 years old, ask your parent or guardian BEFORE giving out any information about yourself, such as your name, age, address or e-mail address.
