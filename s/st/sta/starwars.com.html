This Privacy Policy also explains the choices that you can make about the way your information is collected and used. It is available for you to review on our homepage and at least on every page where we have requested personally identifiable information, including from kids under 13. BY USING THIS WEB SITE, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ASSENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. If you do not agree with any term in this Privacy Policy, do not use this Web site.
<p></p><p>KIDS: Please check with your parents before entering any information on this or any other Web site. See our <b>"SPECIAL NOTE TO KIDS"</b> below.

</p><br><br><b>PARENTS:</b>

<p>We are committed to protecting children's privacy. We developed this Web site to be an enjoyable experience for customers of all ages, including kids under 13. We recognize that some younger children may not understand some of the information contained on this Web site or how this Web site operates. PLEASE BE SURE TO CAUTION YOUR CHILD UNDER 13 AGAINST PROVIDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ONLINE PRIOR TO THE WEB SITE OPERATOR OBTAINING YOUR CONSENT. It is our policy not to knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 without a parent's or guardian's permission. See our "SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS OF KIDS UNDER 13" below.

</p><p>Please discuss this Privacy Policy with your children so that they will better understand how to use this Web site and the information they may be asked to provide. We strongly believe that providing our visitors with accurate and adequate notice about the Web site will lead to informed choices and decisions about how to use the Web site, as well as protecting our users' privacy.

</p><br><br><b>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</b>

<p>Generally, we limit the collection of information to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (e.g., first name, age, state or country). We also collect certain types of personal information such as an email address. This information is collected so that visitors can participate in activities (such as, receiving our e-mail newsletter[s], saving game designs and scores, participating in our question polls).

</p><p>We have many Web sites that contain different activities for you and your family. Some sites are informational only and some collect your personally identifiable information so that you may participate in different activities. The following sites allow children to register following the receipt of parental consent: www.starwars.com and lucasarts.com.

</p><p>In addition, our www.starwars.com site includes a paid membership section, Hyperspace membership, which collects additional personally identifiable information which is not collected for free memberships. Free membership registration requires only the collection of your full name, e-mail address and the creation of a screen name. Hyperspace membership requires the collection of your mailing address and credit/debit card information required for purchasing the membership. Hyperspace members have the ability to participate in activities which free members cannot access, such as special forum participation.

</p><p>In some areas on our Web sites additional personally identifiable information is asked for and collected (for example, full name, mailing address and phone number). This collection is necessary so that our visitors can participate in certain activities, such as online sweepstakes or online promotions. You may not be able to access those areas or participate in such activities without being registered or giving us the necessary personally identifiable information. Whenever we request that you submit such personally identifiable information, we will notify you of our intended use of the information, as more specifically discussed below. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT WE ARE PROHIBITED FROM CONDITIONING A CHILD'S PARTICIPATION IN AN ACTIVITY ON THE CHILD'S DISCLOSING MORE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAN IS REASONABLY NECESSARY TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT ACTIVITY. YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE, AND CAN DECLINE TO PROVIDE, ANY REQUESTED INFORMATION AT ANY TIME. HOWEVER, IF YOU DECLINE TO PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IS REASONABLY NECESSARY TO PARTICIPATE IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE ACTIVITIES AT THIS WEB SITE.

</p><p>The types of information collected at this Web site may include:
</p><ul>
<li>Contact information, such as full name, e-mail address and mailing address.
</li><li>Financial information and/or Credit/Debit Card data (for, by way of example, online store purchase information or for Hyperspace membership). Personal identifiers, such as screen names and passwords.
</li><li>Demographic information, such as date of birth, age, aggregate information, gender, state and country.
</li><li>Internet Protocol (IP) Information, such as your IP address and browser type.
</li><li>Information collected by or held in "cookies" or collected by web beacons.
</li></ul>

</p><br><br><b>Online Promotions:</b>

<p>We or our advertisers, licensees and/or other business partners may have special online promotions which feature products or services related to our business activities. TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY PROMOTION, YOU MUST BE 13 YEARS OR OLDER (unless otherwise specified by the promotion's rules and regulations).

The specific rules and regulations governing the particular promotion will vary and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those rules and regulations.

</p><p>Certain of these promotions may be co-branded with one of our partners. For example, we may have an online promotion to apply for a credit card offer branded with one of our brands (e.g. Star Wars).

The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such information.

</p><br><br><b>Online Contests and Sweepstakes:</b>

<p>We or our advertisers, licensees and/or other business partners may sponsor contests or sweepstakes which may be entered online.

</p><br><br><b>Collecting and Sharing Data:</b>

<p>The following outlines the ways we share your information. We do not share your personally identifiable information in ways other than as described in this Privacy Policy.

If you are 13 or older, we may share this demographic and non-personal information with our advertisers, licensees and/or other business partners.

</p><p>We also use third-party service providers to assist in our service offerings. Such providers may include a credit card processing company, an outside shipping agent to fulfill delivery of orders, and an email service provider to facilitate our e-mailings. We will share your personal information with these types of third parties to facilitate functions on our behalf, even if you are under age 13. We require these companies to limit their use of your personally identifiable information to the purpose of fulfilling their services to us.

</p><p>In some instances, such as when making a purchase, you may be directed to the service providers Web site to conduct the transaction by entering in your personally identifiable information.

However, if you participate in online contests, sweepstakes or promotions, you cannot collect any prizes without your parent's or guardian's consent.

</p><p>If you are under 13, we may knowingly collect your email address, which is personally identifiable information, with your parent's permission. We currently use your email address information in order to send one or more newsletters to you as approved by your parent(s). In addition, following receipt of your parent's permission we collect your screen name. WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO CREATE A SCREEN NAME WHICH DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION.
</p><p>
</p><br><br><b>SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS OF KIDS UNDER 13:</b>

<p>We may collect the online contact information in order to obtain parental consent from parents of kids under 13 and/or to provide parental notice by providing a link to this Privacy Policy wherever we have requested personally identifiable information from kids under 13. If a visitor indicates that he/she is under the age of 13, he/she will be asked to supply a parent's or guardian's e-mail address. In this case, the parent or guardian will receive an e-mail message containing instructions on how to enable the child's registration and until the parent or guardian enables the child's registration, the account is disabled. If we do not receive the parent's or guardian's said consent within a reasonable time, we delete this information from our records. If and when we have obtained consent from a parent, we only ask for and collect from a kid under 13 personally identifiable information that is reasonably necessary for that kid to participate in any given activity online. We also may collect this information to respond to a specific request from a kid under 13. Once we respond to a request from a kid under 13, we may not contact that child again and the information is deleted from our records. We take very seriously the safety of children, especially those under 13 and may also collect this information to protect that safety. If we do collect information to protect the safety of your child, we provide notice to you and we do not use that information for any other purpose. You can always ask us to review or delete any of your child's information and you can refuse to permit further collection or use of your child's information at any time by sending us a written request at the Contact Information below. However, if you ask us to delete your child's information that is necessary to participate in our activities, we may have to ask your child not to participate in our activities.

</p><p>We do not currently collect, use or disclose personally identifiable information from kids we know to be under 13 absent parental consent. Prior to permitting an individual to access our message boards, we request his or her age. If an individual identifies himself or herself as being under 13, we do not give him or her ability to publicly post, directly communicate with others, or otherwise distribute, personally identifiable information.

</p><p>If you wish to review, correct or delete information that Lucasfilm may have about you or your child, or wish to inform us that you do not permit further collection or use of your child's information, please contact us at the following address:
