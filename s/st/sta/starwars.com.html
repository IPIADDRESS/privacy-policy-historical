<p>We value your privacy, and we want to help make your experience with Lucasfilm Ltd. and its affiliates, subsidiaries, and related corporate entities or divisions (collectively, “Lucasfilm,” “we,” or “us”) and our website available at www.starwars.com (the “Site”) as satisfying and safe as possible.

This Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the <a href="/terms"><i>Star Wars</i> Site Terms of Use</a>. By using the Site, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this Policy.</p>
<p>Parents: We are committed to protecting children’s privacy. We developed the Site to be an enjoyable experience for customers of all ages, including kids under 13 years of age. We recognize that some younger children may not understand some of the information contained on the Site or how the Site operates. PLEASE BE SURE TO CAUTION YOUR CHILD UNDER 13 AGAINST PROVIDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ONLINE PRIOR TO THE WEB SITE OPERATOR OBTAINING YOUR CONSENT. It is our policy not to knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 without a parent’s or guardian’s permission. Please see our “Special Note to Parents of Children under 13” below.</p>
<p>Please discuss this Policy with your children so that they will better understand how to use the Site and the information they may be asked to provide. We strongly believe that providing our visitors with accurate and adequate notice about the Site will lead to informed choices and decisions about how to use the site, as well as protecting our users’ privacy.</p>

<a name="1"><h1 class="headline h25">1. Information We Collect</h1></a>
<p>In describing our collection, use, and sharing of information in this Policy, we refer to our collection and use of “Personal Information.” “Personal Information,” as used in this Policy, is personally identifiable information, which is information that allows a person to directly identify an individual, such as first and last name, mailing address, email address or other online contact information, or telephone number. We collect Personal Information, as well as non-personally identifiable information, on the Site.</p>
<p>We collect Personal Information from Site visitors in two ways. First, we collect information that Site visitors provide to us in optional, voluntary submissions, such as in registration forms. This is described in greater detail below in “User-Supplied Information.” Second, some Personal Information may be collected automatically from all visitors to the Site. This is described below in “Passive Data Collection.”</p>
<p>We may also obtain information, including Personal Information, about Site visitors from third-party sources. If we directly combine information from third parties with Personal Information that we collect on the Site, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information and handle it in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<a name="2"><h1 class="headline h25">2. User-Supplied Information</h1></a>
<p>All registration information is submitted to us on a voluntary basis. Users do not need to register to access many areas and features of the Site. If you register to become a member of the Site, we require you to provide your date of birth and to create a screen name and a password. Additionally, if you register to become a member of the Site and are 13 years of age or older, we require you to provide your full name, email address, gender, zip/postal code, and country. </p>
<p>Registered users who are 13 years of age or older may choose to provide additional information in public profiles on the Site, including instant messaging identifiers, occupation/company, website, and biographical information, and to display their full name, age, gender, country, email address, a user-selected avatar, and a link to any blog they maintain on blogs.starwars.com. Registered users may choose not to publicly display certain elements of their profile, or to not display their profile at all, by making the appropriate changes within the “My Settings” area while logged in to their accounts on the Site.</p>
<p>We also may permit users to use third-party login services as an alternative to, or in addition to, registering on the Site. We describe our collection of information through these third-party login services in the “Third-Party Login Services” section below.</p>
<p>Also, in some areas on our Site, we may request and collect additional Personal Information, such as full name, mailing address, and phone number. This collection is necessary so that our users can participate in certain activities, such as to register products and participate in online sweepstakes or online promotions. You may not be able to access those areas or participate in such activities without being a registered member on the Site or giving us the necessary Personal Information. We discuss our uses of many types of Personal Information that we collect below under “How We Use Personal Information.”</p>
<a name="3"><h1 class="headline h25">3. Passive Data Collection</h1></a>
<p>Like most web-based services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser when you use the Site. We may use a variety of methods, including “cookies” and “web beacons,” to collect this information. </p>
<p>A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to an Internet user’s browser by a web server. Cookies are designed to store basic information, such as a user’s preferences. Two types of cookies may be used on our Site: persistent cookies and session-based cookies. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer’s hard drive and remain there after you close your web browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to our Site. Session-based cookies are held temporarily in your computer’s memory and disappear after you close your browser or shut off your computer. We use persistent and session-based cookies for a variety of purposes on the Site. For example, we use persistent cookies to prevent children under 13 from being able to register for our Site and to access certain features and content, to uniquely identify a user’s browser, to identify whether a user is authorized to access certain content on the Site, and to store a user’s screen name. We use session-based cookies to check whether a user is logged in to the Site.</p>
<p>A Web beacon (sometimes referred to as a “clear GIF”) is a small string of code placed in a web page in order to gather statistical site usage information.</p>
<p>The information that we collect with cookies, Web beacons, and other passive methods includes your browser’s IP address, information about how you interact with advertisements and other content on the Site, browser type, system type, the content and pages that you access on the Site, the date and time you view pages on the Site, and the “referring URL” (i.e., the page from which you navigated to the Site).</p>
<p>We may use cookies on the Site to store session validators on your hard drive. We may also include Web beacons in some of our email messages in order to learn whether the messages are delivered and opened.</p>
<p>We may use passively-collected information to: (a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site; (b) monitor your participation in various activities on the Site; (c) monitor aggregate Site usage metrics, such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; (d) administer, operate, and improve the Site and our other services and systems, and (e) to provide services and content that are tailored to you. We may disclose data about our users’ use of the Site collected via passive means to third parties, but will do so in an aggregated manner or otherwise in a way that does not identify you personally.</p>
<p>Also, if you come to the Site via a link from another website, we may also track the source of that link. Websites visited before visiting the Site may place Personal Information within the URL of your browser during a visit to that previous website. We may unintentionally collect that information as part of referring URL information that we automatically receive when you visit the Site.</p>
<p>In addition to our use of cookies, Web beacons, and other technologies as described here, we may use certain third-party companies to help us tailor advertising that we think may be of interest to you based on your use of the Site. For more information about this practice, please see the “Third Party Advertising Technologies” section below.</p>
<a name="4"><h1 class="headline h25">4. How We Use Personal Information</h1></a>
<p>Generally, we use Personal Information to establish and enhance our relationship with our users, and to provide services that they request. We may use Personal Information to operate, provide, improve, and maintain the Site, to develop new products and services; to prevent abusive and fraudulent use of the Site; to personalize and display advertisements and other content on the Site and on our other websites, and communications that we send to you; and for other administrative and internal business purposes. Below, we discuss some specific uses for the Personal Information we collect on the Site.</p>
<p><i>Registration Information </i></p>
<p>We use contact information provided during registration to provide support and otherwise respond to user's requests, to send our newsletters, and to send users other information, including email advertisements, regarding products and services of ourselves and our sponsors. Users may choose to stop receiving any newsletters they subscribe to, and promotional communications that we send, as described in the “Your Choices” section below.</p>
<p><i>Profile Information</i></p>
<p>We allow registered users to subscribe to newsletters and to elect to be notified of special promotions and other information regarding products and services of ourselves and our sponsors, sent by us, within the “My Settings” page while logged in. We send newsletters and promotional communications to the email address users provide during registration (or, in the case of users under 13, their email address as supplied by their parent or guardian). Users may choose to stop receiving these newsletters and other communications as described in the “Your Choices” section below.</p>
<p>Registered users may also provide their full postal address within the “My Settings” page while logged in. We request our registered user's postal addresses so they don’t have to re-enter it for product registration, subscriptions, sweepstakes, and promotions that may be offered on the Site. </p>
<p><i>Hyperspace Membership</i></p>
<p>The Site includes a paid membership section, Hyperspace, on which we provide exclusive content and activities. We no longer sell new Hyperspace memberships or renewals to existing memberships, but if you have purchased or received a Hyperspace subscription, you can enter your subscription code on the Site to start your membership. Additionally, if a friend referred you to Hyperspace, we ask you to provide his or her email address so we may give him or her credit for the referral. </p>
<p><i>Sharing Features </i></p>
<p>We may provide you with various ways to share links to content on the Site with third parties. </p>
<p>For example, we may provide you with the opportunity to email a link to a web page on the Site to another person. To use this feature, we require you to provide your email address and the email address of each person to whom you send the link. The user-inputted email addresses in this context are not stored or used for any other purpose other than to transmit your email message.</p>
<p>We also may allow you to share links to content on the Site with users of various third-party social networking, search and sharing services. When sharing links to content using one of these third-party services, if you are not already logged in to the third-party service, you will need to supply login credentials for it. If you are not a registered user of the third-party service, you will need to sign up for it. You are supplying the registration information or login credentials for the third-party service directly to that third-party, and not to us. By using any of these third-party services to share links to content on the Site, you permit us to access, use and disclose any information relating to your account on each such third-party service (such as your user name and profile information) that is available to us through the third-party service’s application programming interface (API) pursuant to this Policy and the third-party service’s applicable terms of use.</p>
<p><i>Opinions</i></p>
<p>We may ask for user's opinions from time to time. Users may send us questions or comments, which may require Personal Information for a response. We have a policy against accepting unsolicited material, however, so do not submit any unsolicited or unique creative ideas, drawings or other materials, and refer to our policy on unsolicited submissions in the <a href="/terms/index.html" title="Star Wars Terms of Use"><i>Star Wars</i> Site Terms of Use</a>. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT’S OR GUARDIAN’S CONSENT BEFORE YOU CAN PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION.</p>
<p><i>Online Contests, Sweepstakes, and other Promotions</i></p>
<p>We or our advertisers, licensees, and other business partners may conduct or sponsor special online promotions, and contests or sweepstakes, which users may enter or otherwise participate in on the Site. To participate in any contest, sweepstakes, or other promotion, you must be 13 years of age or older (unless otherwise specified by the rules and regulations of the contest, sweepstakes, or other promotion). If you are under 13, you will need your parent’s or guardian’s consent before you can participate in this activity. If you are 13 or older but not an adult you will need your parent’s or guardian’s consent to collect any prize that may be available in any contest or sweepstakes, or to receive any prize or other benefit that may be offered for participation in any other promotion. You may be asked to provide Personal Information, such as your name, e-mail address, or mailing address, or to select a screen name, if you participate in an online promotion on the Site. </p>
<p>Certain of these promotions may be co-branded with one of our partners. In these instances, the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by our third-party partner on their website and may be shared with us. The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such information. </p>
<a name="5"><h1 class="headline h25">5. When We Disclose Personal Information</h1></a>
<p>We do not rent or sell email addresses or any other Personal Information. We do not share Personal Information with third parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Policy. </p>
<p><i>Mailing Lists</i></p>
<p>Where appropriate, and if you are 13 years of age or older, we may provide you with the option to share certain information, including Personal Information, with some of our promotional partners, or the option for you to elect not to have us share certain information may be provided.</p>
<p><i>Service Providers</i> </p>
<p>We may provide Personal Information to third-parties for their use in performing internal business functions (e.g., payment processing, maintenance, security, data analysis, email transmission, or data hosting) on our behalf. Additionally, some third-party service providers may collect information, including Personal Information, on the Site on our behalf. Whenever possible, we require such third-parties to only collect and use Personal Information in accordance with this Policy, to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of such Personal Information, and for no purpose other than providing us with our requested services. </p>

<a name="7"><h1 class="headline h25">7. Special Note to Children Under 13</h1></a>
<p>If you are under 13 years of age, ask your parent or guardian before providing any information about yourself, such as your name, age, address or e-mail address. You do not have to provide any Personal Information about yourself. Remember, if you are under 13, you must have your parent or guardian make any changes to information provided to us in the past or to update your profile. If you are ever unsure about anything you are seeing on the Site, ask your parent or guardian for help. </p>
<p>If you are under 13, we may collect your email address with your parent or guardian’s permission. We may use your email address to send one or more newsletters to you as approved by your parent or guardian. In addition, following receipt of your parent or guardian’s permission, we collect your screen name. We strongly encourage you to create a screen name that does not contain any Personal Information. </p>
<p>If you are 13 years of age or older, you may have the ability to participate in online contests or sweepstakes, e-mail other users or to submit, publish, or display messages or other content on portions of the Site. In the event that you do submit, publish, or display messages or other content on the Site, remember that the contents of your message or other publication, as well as your user name and any other information that you have chosen to make public in your profile on the Site (which may include your e-mail address if you choose to publish it) is publicly available and can be used by other users of the Site, by us, and by others without restriction. If you participate in online contests, sweepstakes or promotions, however, you cannot collect any prizes without your parent’s or guardian’s consent.</p>
<a name="8"><h1 class="headline h25">8. Special Note to Parents of Children Under 13</h1></a>
<p>When visitors to the Site click our “Registration” link, they are asked to supply their date of birth. If a visitor to the Site indicates that he/she is under 13 years of age while attempting to register, he/she will be asked to supply a parent’s or guardian’s email address. We will send an email message to that email address containing instructions on how to enable the child’s registration. Until the parent or guardian enables the child’s registration, we do not collect the child’s email address or permit the child to create a screen name. If and when we obtain consent from a parent or guardian of a child under 13, we only ask for and collect Personal Information from the child that is reasonably necessary for that child to participate in any given activity on our Site. We cannot condition a child’s access to an activity on the Site on giving out more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary for that activity.</p>
<p>If a child is under 13, we may collect the child’s email address with the permission of the child’s parent or guardian. In addition, following receipt of permission from the parent or guardian of a child, we collect the child’s screen name. We strongly encourage children to create a screen name that does not contain any Personal Information. We use the child’s email address to send one or more newsletters to the child as approved by his or her parent or guardian. We also may use the child’s email address to send the child advertisements or other materials, in addition to newsletters. We may use the child’s screen name to customize any newsletters, advertisements, or other materials that we send to the child. Also, if we have collected any other information from the child in his or her use of the Site (such as information about the child having accessed particular areas on the Site, or having used particular features on the Site, that we have compiled into a profile or otherwise associated with the child’s email address or screen name), we may use that to customize any newsletters, advertisements, or other materials that we send to the child’s email address.</p>
<p>We also may collect Personal Information on the Site to respond to a specific request from a child under 13. Once we respond to the specific request, we will not contact that child again and will delete his/her Personal Information from our records. </p>
<p>We take very seriously the safety of children, especially those under 13, and may also collect and use Personal Information from them to protect their safety. If we do collect or use Personal Information to protect the safety of a child under 13, we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice to the child’s parent or guardian, and will not use that Personal Information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>We also may collect and use Personal Information from children under 13 to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security or integrity of the Site, take precautions against liability, respond to judicial process, or to the extent permitted under other provisions of law. </p>
<p>If you are a parent or guardian of a child under 13, you can always ask us to review or delete any Personal Information of that child, and you can refuse to permit further collection or use of his/her Personal Information at any time by sending a written request to the physical or email address below. If you ask us to delete his/her Personal Information that is necessary to participate in any of our activities, we may have to block him/her from participating in those activities.</p>
<p>If you wish to review, correct, or delete Personal Information that we may have about you or your child under 13, or wish to inform us that you do not permit further collection or use of Personal Information of your child under 13, you may contact us using the following contact information:</p>
