<!-- When you access InfoLouisiana, information 
                        is collected and stored about the domain from which you

                        potential problems, and overall website efficiency. This 
                        information is not used to track an individual's use of

                          Government agencies or various services offered on INFO Louisiana 
                          may request personally identifiable information in order

                        <p>Personal information is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable 
to that specific individual. Personal information includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone number. 
A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information. </p><p>

We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for information, 
i.e., sending an email, registering or participating in a listserv, participating in a survey, or obtaining a state service 

online (<a href="http://laemall.com/emall/security.html">Louisiana E-Mall Privacy Statement</a>). 
If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way effect your ability to use any other 
feature of INFO Louisiana. 

If personal information is requested on the Web site or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law.

Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children online or by E-mail will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public access.

 For site security purposes and to ensure that this

                          web servers employ industry-standard methods to monitor 
                          network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to 
                          upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. 
                          Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change 
                          information on INFO Louisiana servers are strictly prohibited 
                          and may be punishable by law.<!-- including the Computer

                          of this security monitoring, there is no expectation 
                          of privacy. However, only in the case of actual law 
                          enforcement investigations, will an attempt be made 
                          to identify individual users or their usage habits. /!--><p></p>
                        <p>Various Web sites will be linked through INFO Louisiana. 
                          This includes Web sites of other governmental agencies, 
                          as well as Web sites of private entities. Many of these

                          and security standards. Visitors to those Web sites 
                          are advised to check the privacy statements of those

Cookies are simple text files stored on your computer by your Web browser. 
They provide a method of distinguishing among visitors to INFO Louisiana.</p> <p>

Cookies that may be created on your computer by using this Web site do not contain personally identifying information and

			<!--A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent 
                          to your browser when you access a Web site. There are 
                          two kinds of cookies. A session cookie is a line of 
                          text that is stored temporarily in your computer's RAM. 
                          Because a session cookie is never written to a drive, 
                          it is destroyed as soon as you close your browser. A 
                          persistent cookie is a more permanent line of text that 
                          gets saved by your browser to a file on your hard drive. 
                          Depending on your browser settings, you may receive 
                          notification that a given site is requesting cookie 
                          information, possibly with an expiration date. Persistent 
                          cookies have an expiration date in the future. Session 
                          cookies have no date associated with them./!--> <p></p>
                        <p>The only aspect of INFO Louisiana that creates a cookie 
                          is <a href="http://asklouise.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/asklouise.cfg/php/enduser/std_alp.php?p_sid=djmxA4hg&amp;p_lva=&amp;p_sp=&amp;p_li=">Ask Louise</a>. 
Ask Louise creates a session cookie while 
                          you are using Ask Louise and keep the browser 
                          software open. The session cookie is destroyed as soon 
                          as the browser is closed. <br>
