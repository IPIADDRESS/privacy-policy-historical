<h5>1. Read this first!</h5>
<p>These conditions represent an agreement between you and Stardoll. By accepting the agreement you are promising and agreeing also to follow the other rules which Stardoll has on its website. This agreement also applies when you purchase products on Stardoll's website; see below under “Terms of sale.” If you don't accept this agreement, you should not register as a member on Stardoll.
It is very important that you go through the conditions in this agreement together with your parents so that you know what you can and cannot do on the Stardoll website. Ask your parents to go through the conditions with you carefully and to help you register. When you register, activate your account and accept this agreement, you become a member. This means that you accept the conditions below and that you confirm that your parents have also read and accepted the conditions.</p>

<h5>2. Special information for PARENTS</h5>
<p>Contact us at the e-mail address <a href="mailto:parentalrights@stardoll.com">parentalrights@stardoll.com</a> if you have not accepted this agreement and if your child has become a member of Stardoll. Stardoll uses both technical filters and moderators who supervise what happens on Stardoll's website in order to offer a nice and safe environment. The moderators also answer members' reports of unpleasant and unsuitable behavior but we still urge all parents to be actively involved in following their children's activity on the Internet.</p>

<p>Stardoll is dedicated to protecting the privacy of its members and handling any personal information we obtain from our members with care and respect. The information and the terms in this agreement that we conclude with our members fulfils the high standard of protection provided for in the European Union and in the United States. For citizens in the US the COPPA rules apply to children under the age of 13. From the terms on Personal Data and Privacy Policy below you can see what information we collect from our members, what we do with it and the limited involvement of third parties. An overall principle is that we do not collect more information than is reasonably necessary for  children to participate in activities on Stardoll.</p>

<p>If your child is under the age of 13 and attempts to register, the account will automatically be flagged as a pending and limited membership account and we will inform your child that parental consent is required to activate a full membership account. Subject to the COPPA regulation and depending on the level of activity the child wishes to obtain your consent can either be to accept our “Notice to Parents” e-mail or to send us your consent via fax. A more detailed description of the level of activities is presented in the “Notice to Parents” e-mail that you receive from us. Until this level of verifiable parental consent is obtained your child will only have access to certain features of the Site and have limited access to Stardoll.</p>

<p>If you would like to see what information Stardoll has about your child, you can contact Stardoll at the same e-mail address indicated above: <a href="mailto:parentalrights@stardoll.com">parentalrights@stardoll.com</a> or send us a letter to:</p>

<p>STARDOLL AB<br>
Hudiksvallsgatan 8<br>
S 113 30 Stockholm<br>
SWEDEN<br>
or fax at one of the following numbers:<br>
Fax number: USA (+1 - 212 - 208 4566)<br>
Fax number: Great Britain (+44 - 20 - 7990 9907)<br>
Fax number: Argentina (+54 - 11 - 40321600)<br></p>


<p>For the security of our members Stardoll retains the right to require the identification of parents. We are not entitled to disclose other children's/members' personal data to you as a parent. Stardoll can only disclose personal data belonging to children other than your own if a legal and/or police obligation exists to do so.</p> 

<h5 id="privacy">3.  Personal data and Privacy Policy (including Kid’s Privacy Policy)</h5>
<p>In order to register as a member of Stardoll, we may ask you to provide us with the following personal data:</p>


<p>-	first and last name,<br>
-	your e-mail address,<br> 
-	user name,<br>
-	your age,<br>
-	gender,<br>
-	the country where you live</p>


<p>By doing so, you give Stardoll permission to use the above personal data so that Stardoll can send out news, contests, offers and advertising to your e-mail address and so that Stardoll can adjust the content and advertising on its website to your or others' age group and gender. Examples of the e-mail mailings are, for instance, that Stardoll wants to notify you about new or improved services on Stardoll, that Stardoll is carrying out membership surveys in order to improve our services or that Stardoll is creating targeted content and offers for you based on information about how you act on the Web site, what your age is and where you are located geographically.</p>

<p>Stardoll agrees not to sell or transfer your personal data to a third party. An exception is if all or essentially all resources of the Stardoll company, that is to say, the entire website, are acquired by another company (a so-called acquisition of assets and liabilities). In that case the personal data required in order to continue to operate Stardoll are acquired by the buyer.</p>

<p>It can happen that Stardoll comes to rely on other companies in order to carry out various tasks such as, for example, help with marketing, the performing of technical services for our webpages, etc. These companies can in certain cases gain access to personal data which they need in order to complete an assignment for Stardoll. Stardoll treats all personal data with the greatest care and signs agreements with other companies which mean that they can only use your data in order to complete the assignment for Stardoll. </p>

<p>The same applies in those cases where Stardoll co-operates with another company to provide you with interesting offers. Such companies do not have access to your personal data other than for assisting Stardoll with its mailings, banner marketing and the like which you have given Stardoll permission to by this agreement. Such companies will not have the right to retain and use the data for any other purposes than the assignment for Stardoll.</p>

<p>Stardoll stores all personal data gathered from members for one year after the date when approval is revoked or membership is canceled. During this year personal data are not used and are saved only for the security of members, that is, in order to prevent, investigate, uncover and prosecute potential crimes against one of our members. </p>

<h5>4. Questions concerning personal data and revoking approval </h5>

<p>If you want to know what information Stardoll has about you or have other questions about your personal data, you can contact us <a href="http://www.stardoll.com/help/contact.php">here</a>. 
You can cancel your approval for handling and saving your personal data. In that case click <a href="http://www.stardoll.com/help/optOut.php">here</a> and fill in the form. Please note that this means that your membership in Stardoll is canceled as a result, see more under clause 10 below. </p>

<p>In order to be able to offer the best possible user experience on Stardoll, we need to be able to store personal information about you (so-called personal data). If you don't allow us to do this, we cannot adjust Stardoll to your needs or send you information about bargain sales, offers, etc., via e-mail. If you don't allow us to process personal data about you, we cannot handle your membership. For this reason we ask you to cancel your membership if you do not wish to allow us to procss your personal data.</p>

<p>You can let us know if you want to cancel your approval for receiving information and offers via e-mail. In that case please click <a href="http://www.stardoll.com/help/optOut.php">here</a>. Please note that this means that your membership in Stardoll is canceled as a result. </p>

<p>In order to be able to offer you the best possible experience on Stardoll, we need to be able to communicate with you as a member via e-mail. If you don't allow us to send you information sometimes about bargain sales, offers and news, we cannot provide the best possible service. We always try to send interesting information. If you don't allow us to occasionally send you e-mail, we must ask you to cancel your membership.</p>
