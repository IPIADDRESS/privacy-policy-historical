It is very important that you go through the conditions in this agreement together with your parents so that you know what you can and cannot do on the Stardoll website. Ask your parents to go through the conditions with you carefully and to help you register. When you register, activate your account and accept this agreement, you become a member. This means that you accept the conditions below and that you confirm that your parents have also read and accepted the conditions.</p>

<p>Stardoll reserves the right to make changes to these membership terms if Stardoll deems it necessary or if it is required by law. In the case of material change, Stardoll will notify you of the change in advance of the change becoming effective. If you do not want to accept the change, you may terminate your membership with immediate effect at any time before the change becomes effective. You can easily terminate your membership <a href="http://www.stardoll.com/help/optOut.php">here</a>. By using the services available on Stardoll’s website, such as Star-dollars and virtual products (virtual clothes and all other goods and services on Stardoll's website) you accept the membership terms and agree to comply with them.</p>

<p>Stardoll solely decides on the content of the Stardoll website, such as for example new games, products, including the rules of such games and products.

<h5>2. Special information for PARENTS</h5>

<p>Contact us at the e-mail address <a href="mailto:parentalrights@stardoll.com">parentalrights@stardoll.com</a> if you have not accepted this agreement and if your child has become a member of Stardoll. Stardoll uses both technical filters and moderators who supervise what happens on Stardoll's website in order to offer a nice and safe environment. The moderators also answer members' reports of unpleasant and unsuitable behavior but we still urge all parents to be actively involved in following their children's activity on the Internet.</p>

<p>Stardoll is dedicated to protecting the privacy of its members and handling any personal information we obtain from our members with care and respect.

An overall principle is that we do not collect more information than is reasonably necessary for children to participate in activities on Stardoll.</p>

<p>If your child is of age that full access to the website requires parental consent, the account will automatically be flagged as a pending and limited membership account and we will inform your child that parental consent is required to activate a full membership account. Subject to applicable regulation and depending on the level of activity the child wishes to obtain, your consent is needed as stated in the “Notice to Parents” e-mail. A more detailed description of the level of activities is presented in the “Notice to Parents” e-mail that you receive from us. Until the appropriate level of verifiable parental consent is obtained your child will only have access to certain features of the Site and have limited access to Stardoll.</p>

<p>
- Your first and last name,<br>

Examples of communication are, for instance, promotional newsletter e-mails, to notify you about new or improved services on Stardoll, that Stardoll is carrying out membership surveys in order to improve our services or that Stardoll is creating targeted content and offers for you based on information about how you act on the Web site, what your age is and where you are located geographically. You may opt-out from the Stardoll e-mail program at any time, either by following unsubscribe links within received e-mails, or by adjusting your Stardoll email settings.</p>

<p>
Stardoll agrees not to sell or transfer your personal data, including e-mail addresses, to a third party. An exception is if all or essentially all resources of the Stardoll company, that is to say, the entire website, are acquired by another company (a so-called acquisition of assets and liabilities). In that case the personal data required in order to continue to operate Stardoll are acquired by the buyer.
</p>

<p>It can happen that Stardoll comes to rely on other companies in order to carry out various tasks such as, for example, help with marketing, the performing of technical services for our websites, etc. These companies can in certain cases gain access to personal data which they need in order to complete an assignment for Stardoll. Stardoll treats all personal data with the greatest care and signs agreements with other companies which mean that they can only use your data in order to complete the assignment for Stardoll.</p>

<p>The same applies in those cases where Stardoll co-operates with another company to provide you with interesting offers. Such companies do not have access to your personal data other than for assisting Stardoll with its mailings, banner marketing and the like which you have given Stardoll permission to by this agreement. Such companies will not have the right to retain and use the data for any other purposes than the assignment for Stardoll.</p>

Once you allow Stardoll to connect with Connect Service, you will be able to use your Connect Service login information to log into Stardoll as a member, and you will be able to publish your activity on Stardoll to your Connect Service profile. Additionally, by using Connect Service, you permit Stardoll to access information related to you (including your profile information, friends, and privacy settings) so you can use your information on Stardoll, and so that we can help improve your use of Stardoll and allow you to interact with your Connect Service friends on Stardoll. All such Connect Service personal data will be handled in accordance with Stardoll’s general privacy policy as described in this agreement and you permit Stardoll to use the data in accordance with other personal data as described above in this section of the Agreement. In order to make the Connect Service possible, you agree to allow the Connect Service Provider, such as Facebook, to check your Facebook cookies when you are visiting Stardoll, and allow Facebook to receive information concerning the actions you take on Stardoll (which we will only send with your permission). The information shared with the Connect Service provider will be transmitted to and stored by the Connect Service provider on servers that can be placed outside your country of residence. In the event you no longer want Stardoll to publish stories about you, or want to otherwise limit the ways in which Stardoll interacts with your account with a Connect Service provider, you can always disable this feature by changing your application settings in this third party Connect Service.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by Stardoll through your Connect Service login, however, your activities on the Connect Service provider’s site, such as Facebook, are covered by their privacy policy and other terms of use (in Facebook’s case <a href="http://www.facebook.com/terms.php">www.facebook.com/terms.php</a>; <a href="http://www.facebook.com/policy.php">www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>).</p>

<p>Stardoll reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently.

If any changes are unacceptable to you, you shall stop using this site. Your continuing use of the Stardoll website, can, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed as an acceptance of these terms, including changes.</p>

<h5>4. Questions concerning personal data and revoking approval</h5>

<h4>TERMS OF SALE</h4>

<h5>14. Prices and delivery</h5>

<p>Stardoll has the right to determine the prices and other terms of sale on the website itself and to change them. If certain products need to be shipped, then the shipping costs are not included in the price of the product, but all such costs are added to your bill and can be viewed when you complete your purchase.</p>

<p>We accept a variety of different methods of payment. Examples of some of these are credit cards, mobile phones, telephones, gift cards, pre-paid cards and PayPal. Locally available forms of payment are displayed at any given point on the payment page for your country. For EU residents VAT is included in accordance with currently applicable tax legislation. This will be displayed along with the price. When you pay by mobile phone and telephony, VAT or sales tax are included according to local regulations.</p>

<p>The virtual products you buy become available to you as soon as possible. Star dollars and virtual products (virtual clothes and all other goods and services on Stardoll's website) may not be exchanged unless Stardoll decides to allow for exchanges in particular cases. Stardoll is entitled to make such decisions itself on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>All virtual products and Stardollars are part of the service provided to you on Stardoll’s website and you only receive a right to use them according to the terms on the website from time to time. The virtual products and the Stardollars do not have any monetary value and may not be exchanged for money. The availability of virtual products and the type and range of items available for purchase may be changed by Stardoll without notice. Any virtual products purchased within a Superstar membership may be modified or become unavailable for use once your superstar membership expires.</p>

<p>Stardollars have an expiration date of 12 months after purchase and gift cards are valid for 6 months after purchase.</p>

<h5>15. Credit card security</h5>

<p>We want you to feel secure and safe when you shop on Stardoll. You can give us your credit card information when you shop with us. We use state-of-the-art security systems available on the market and your data are protected on our servers throughout the order process with the help of encryption and firewall technology. On most web browsers a small lock is displayed on the menu bar (task bar) at the very bottom of the screen when you visit a secure site. Look to see if this icon is present when you visit a website where you are invited to give out personal information. We also use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption in order to protect your personal data from use by unauthorized persons.</p>

<h5>16. Approval by the person liable for payment</h5>

<p>You must have gained permission from the recipient of the invoice, the cardholder or the primary account holder of the phone used before you purchase a Superstar membership or Stardollars. If you make purchases without such approval, Stardoll is entitled to cancel your membership account.</p>

<h5>17. Returns</h5>

<p>We accept returns for products you have purchased that are not virtual products purchased on the website and provided that these products along with the packaging is returned in its original condition within 14 days of the shipping date.
