<h2>
<a name="HowInfoIsUsed"></a>How We Use Information We Collect</h2><p>How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Products you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to us.&nbsp; Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you.</p><p>
1.<strong>&nbsp;To provide the Products and personalize your experience:</strong><br>We use information about you to provide the Products to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate and maintain the Products. For example, we use the name and picture you provide in your account to identify you to tailor features that personalize your experience and provide notifications and recommendations that are most relevant for you.&nbsp; For example, we may use your stated job title and activity to provide information we think are relevant to your job function. We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites. Where you use multiple Products, we combine information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to find information from one Product while searching from another or to present relevant product information as you travel across our websites.</p><p>2.<strong>&nbsp;For research and development:</strong> We are always looking for ways to make our Products more useful, relevant, faster, and secure to you.&nbsp; We use collective learnings about how people use our Products and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Products.&nbsp; &nbsp;We automatically analyze and aggregate frequently viewed articles to improve relevance of suggested topics that auto-populate when you use the search feature.&nbsp; In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Products to improve and develop similar features or to better integrate the services you use. We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.</p><p>3.<strong>&nbsp;To communicate with you about the Products:</strong> We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Products, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.&nbsp; We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us.&nbsp; For example, certain actions you take in the Products may automatically provide you with the requested content.&nbsp; These communications are part of the Products and in most cases you can opt out of them.&nbsp; If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.</p><p>4.<strong>&nbsp;To market, promote and drive engagement with the Products:</strong> We use your contact information and information about how you use the Products to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Crain Product ads on other companies' websites and applications, as well as on other companies’ platforms and websites.&nbsp; These communications are aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Products, including information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you.&nbsp; We also communicate with you about new product offers, promotions and contests.&nbsp; You can control whether you receive these communications as described below under "Opt-out of communications."</p><p>5.<strong>&nbsp;Customer support:</strong> We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Products.</p><p>6.<strong>&nbsp;For safety and security:</strong> We use information about you and your use to verify accounts and activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of Terms of Conditions of use policies.</p><p>7.<strong>&nbsp;To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights:</strong> Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.</p><p>8.<strong>&nbsp;With your consent:</strong> We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above.</p><p>9. <strong>Legal basis for processing (for EEA users):</strong>&nbsp;If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal basis for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal basis depends on the Products you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:</p>
	<ul>
		
<li>We need it to provide you the Products, including to operate the Products, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Products;</li>

<li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as to market and promote the Products, for research and development and to protect our legal rights and interests;</li>

<li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or</li>

<li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>

	</ul>
	
<p>If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.&nbsp; Where we are using your information because we or a third-party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean you no longer will have access to the Product.</p><div class="separator gold"><hr></div>

<strong>Sharing with Other Users</strong><br>When you use the Products, we share certain information about you with other users.</p><p>1. <strong>For Collaboration:</strong> You can create content, which may contain information about you, for other users to see. For example, when you comment, we display your profile picture and name next to your comments so that other users with access to the page or issue understand who made the comment.</p><p>2. <strong>Managed Accounts:</strong> If you register or access the Products using an email address with a domain that is owned by your employer or organization, and such organization requests, certain information about you including your name, contact info, content and past use of your account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator.&nbsp; If you are an administrator for a particular site or group of users within the Products, we may share your contact information with current or past users, for the purpose of facilitating service-related requests.</p><p>3. <strong>Community Forums</strong>: Our websites may offer publicly accessible comment areas and blogs. You should be aware that any information you provide on these websites - including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information - may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites.&nbsp; Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Products. To request removal of your information from publicly accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as provided below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p><p>
<strong>Sharing with Third Parties</strong><br>We share information with third parties that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support and market our Products.</p><p>1. <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you.&nbsp; If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including policies and procedures designed to protect your information.</p><p>2. <strong>Crain Partners:</strong> We work with third parties who provide consulting, sales, and technical services to deliver and implement customer solutions around the Products. We may share your information with these third parties in connection with their services, such as to assist with billing and collections, to provide localized support, and to provide customizations. We may also share information with these third parties where you have agreed to that sharing.</p><p>3. <strong>Links to Third-party Sites</strong>: The Products may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit information to any of those third-party sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies, not this one. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p><p>4. <strong>Third-Party Widgets</strong>: Some of our Products contain widgets and social media features, such as the Twitter "tweet" button. These widgets and features collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Products, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Widgets and social media features are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our Products. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p><p><em>With your consent</em>: We share information about you with third parties when you give us consent or we are allowed to do so under applicable laws.</p><p>5. <strong>Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Rights</strong>: In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third-party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable laws, legal process or governmental request, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect Crain, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.</p><p>
<strong>a) Sharing with Affiliated Companies</strong><br>We share information we collect with affiliated companies and, in some cases, with prospective affiliates. Affiliated companies are companies owned or operated by us. The protections of this privacy policy apply to the information we share in these circumstances.</p><p><strong>b) Business Transfers</strong>: We may share or transfer information we collect under this privacy policy in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. You will be notified via email and/or a general notice on the Products if a transaction takes place, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.</p><div class="separator gold"><hr></div>

<h2>
<a name="HowInfoIsStored"></a>How We Store and Secure Information We Collect</h2><p>
1. <strong>Information storage and security</strong><br>We use data hosting service providers in the United States, and the UK and Denmark to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data.&nbsp; While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. Please refer to the Section below titled “How we transfer information we collect internationally” for information on the transfer of EU citizen’s data outside of the EU.</p><p>
2.<strong>&nbsp;How long we keep information</strong><br>How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below.&nbsp; After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.</p><p>a) <strong>Account information</strong>: We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Products.&nbsp; We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Products.</p><p>b) <strong>Managed accounts</strong>: If the Products are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by your employer.&nbsp; For more information, see "Managed accounts and administrators" above.</p><p>c) <strong>Marketing information</strong>: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Products, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Crain account.&nbsp; We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.</p><div class="separator gold"><hr></div>

<h2>
<a name="HowInfoIsAccessed"></a>How to Access and Control Your Information</h2><p>You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.</p><p>
<strong>Your Choices:</strong><br>You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format.&nbsp; Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests. You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Products and using settings available within the Products or your account. Where the Products are administered for you by an employer (see "Notice to End Users" below), you may first need to contact your employer to assist with your request. For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the <strong><a href="#ContactUs">Contact Us</a></strong> section below to request assistance.</p><p>Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: For example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.</p><p>1. <strong>Access and update your information</strong>: Member Services, manages the set-up and the administration of all membership accounts as well as each member profile through your primary account representative.&nbsp; Updates to your profile may be provided through your representative, or by contacting Member Services directly.</p><p>2. <strong>Deactivate your account</strong>: If you no longer wish to use our Products, either you or your employer may contact member services who can deactivate your account.</p><p>3. <strong>Delete your information</strong>: In some cases, you may ask us to delete accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information.&nbsp; You request by contacting customer service. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.</p><p>4. <strong>Request that we stop using your information</strong>: In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe an account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy.&nbsp; Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below. When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request.&nbsp; If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your employer does not object (where applicable).</p><p>5. <strong>Opt out of communications</strong>: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your Product account settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.&nbsp; Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages (such as a receipt for a purchase) from us regarding our Products.</p><p>You may be able to opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from other companies who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or who subscribe to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. For more information about this practice and to understand your options, please visit: http://www.aboutads.info, http://optout.networkadvertising.org/ and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu.">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu.</a></p><p>6. <strong>Mobile Consents/Opt-Outs:</strong>&nbsp;We may send you messages, including marketing, via your wireless email address or by short message service (SMS), wireless access protocol (WAP) services or mobile phone service. By providing us with your wireless email address or by signing up for any SMS, WAP or mobile phone service, you consent to receiving services and messages at the address or number you provide for such purposes, and understand that your wireless carrier’s rates apply to these services/messages. You may opt-out of SMS, WAP or mobile services by following the instructions provided in the message.</p><p>7. <strong>Send "Do Not Track" Signals</strong>: Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our Products do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. You can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us as described above.</p><p>8. <strong>Data Portability</strong>: Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to another carrier). Depending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.&nbsp; Should you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file of your basic account information.</p><div class="separator gold"><hr></div>

<a name="InternationalTransfer"></a>How We Transfer Information We Collect Internationally</h2><p>
<strong>International Transfers of Information We Collect</strong><br>We collect information globally and primarily store that information in the United States, the UK and Denmark. We transfer, process and store your information outside of your country of residence, to wherever we or our third-party service providers operate for the purpose of providing you the Products. Whenever we transfer your information, we take steps to protect it.</p><p>1. <strong>International Transfers within the Crain Companies</strong>: To facilitate our global operations, we transfer EU data information to the United States and allow access to that information from countries in which the Crain owned or operated companies have operations for the purposes described in this policy. These countries may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the laws of many of the countries where our customers and users are based. When we share information about you within and among Crain corporate affiliates, we make use of standard contractual data protection clauses, which have been approved by the European Commission.</p><p>2. <strong>International Transfers to Third Parties</strong>: Some of the third parties described in this privacy policy, which provide services to us under contract, are based in other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the country in which you reside. When we share information of customers in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, we make use of the European Commission-approved standard contractual data protection clauses, or other appropriate legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer.</p><div class="separator gold"><hr></div>
