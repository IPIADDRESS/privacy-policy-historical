<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>
<a name="howcollected" id="howcollected"></a>
<h2>How is information collected?</h2>
<p>We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Site,
  including but not limited to those described below:</p>
<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>You may be asked first to complete a registration form and provide personally
  identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password
  in order to take advantage of certain features the Site may choose to offer,
  including, but not limited to, Newsletters, Contests, Forums, Fantasy or other
  subscription based services.</p>
<h3>Newsletters and Site Emails</h3>
<p>We may offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Site,
  about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our business partners
  and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter either by registering
  for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership
  for which you have registered on the Site. You may cancel your free email subscription
  by following the instructions provided on the Site or, in some instances, in
  the designated area of certain newsletters or emails.</p>
<h3>Contests or Sweepstakes</h3>
<p>We may operate contests and sweepstakes through the Site, which may require
  registration. Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact
  you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes.
  We may ask your permission to allow us to post publicly some of your information
  on the Site, such as on a winner's page, in the event you win a contest or
  sweepstakes. Except as required by applicable law, we will not post your information
  without your permission. In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor
  may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Site, and collect your
  information. In those cases, where we are not the operator or host of the contest
  or sweepstakes, we have no control over the information collected and accordingly
  urge you to review the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable
  to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.</p>
<h3>Surveys or Voting</h3>
<p>From time-to-time we may request personally identifiable information from
  you via surveys or voting polls. Participation is voluntary and you will have
  the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information. At times,
  you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>As with many Websites, the Site uses standard technology called "cookies," which
  are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you allow your
  browser to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your Web browser
  to the Site whenever you visit the Site, and make using the Site easier for
  you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences. By tracking how and
  when you use the Site, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and
  which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Site are based on data
  obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to
  personalize your experience on the Site. Cookies may also allow the Site to
  present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do not want
  information collected through the use of cookies, you generally can opt out
  of providing this information by turning the cookies off in your browser; however,
  some areas of the Site may not provide you with a personalized experience if
  you have disabled the use of cookies.</p>
<h3>IP Addresses and Click-stream Data</h3>
<p>We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for purposes of system
  administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors.
  An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever
  you access the Internet. Our computers identify your computer by its IP address.
  When you request Web pages from the Site, our computers log your IP address.</p>
<p>Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request
  Web pages from the Site. Click-stream data may include such information as
  the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making
  the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information.
  When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Site,
  what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate
  are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.</p>
<h3>Transaction Information</h3>
<p>If you order any information from our Site, buy any of our products or subscribe
  for any of the services offered on our Site, we will ask you to complete an
  order form that will request certain information from you, including financial
  information such as a credit card number and expiration date and general contact,
  billing and shipping information. We will use this information to complete
  the transaction that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the information,
  products or other services that you order, and to invoice you. Such information
  is collected and stored through encrypted means for your protection. </p>
<h3>Fantasy Games</h3>
<p>When you register to play Fantasy games, you may be asked to provide personally
  identifiable information.</p>

<h2>How we use the information we collect?</h2>
<p>We internally use personally identifiable information about our customers
  to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze
  site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our
  site's content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site
  and provide better service to our customers.</p>
<p>We may occasionally use a customer's email address and, in rare situations
  mailing address or phone number, to contact a customer regarding administrative
  matters or notices.</p>
<p>We may use information in the file we maintain about a customer to resolve
  disputes and troubleshoot problems.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>
<a name="whomshared" id="whomshared"></a>
<h2>With whom the information may be shared</h2>
<p>Information we collect may be accessed by a variety of parties, depending
  upon the project for which the information was originally collected, the terms
  of that engagement, and the policies into or out of which the consumer has
  opted. From time to time, we may send you offers from the STAPLES Center, its
  affiliated properties, and our promotional partners based on the information
  you have provided us. In addition, we may provide information we collect about
  you with third party companies regarding promotions, sweepstakes and other
  opportunities / offers. These third parties are subject to stringent data security
  and confidentiality requirements and, upon completion of their fulfillment
  services, all information is returned to the STAPLES Center or is destroyed.</p>
<p>While we believe this disclosure of your information will result in opportunities
  that may be of interest to you, you have the right to tell us not to give your
  information to any third party. If you want the STAPLES Center to keep all
  of your information we have collected confidential and not share it with any
  third party, please either email us or mail your written request to:</p>
<p>STAPLES Center<br>
  C/O Internet Guest Services<br>

p&gt;
<p>Your request must include your name, email address, mailing address and must
  be signed. (Signature only required for written request sent by regular mail).
  Please allow six weeks to process your request. After your request has been
  fulfilled, the only disclosures we will make are those required by law.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>
<a name="choices" id="choices"></a>
<h2>What choices do I have about the STAPLES Center collecting, using, and sharing
  my information?</h2>
<p>It is possible for you to use much of our site without giving us any personally
  identifiable information. When you do register with us or give us personally
  identifiable information, you will have an opportunity at the time we collect
  your information -- to limit e-mail communications from the STAPLES Center
  and from our third-party partners. You can request at any time that the Staples
  Center not send future e-mail to you either by unsubscribing from the communication
  or by contacting us. Also, as mentioned above, there are ways to limit the
  information collected through technology -- though some of our features won't
  work if you decide to do this.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

  or alteration of your information?</h2>
