      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" class="text2">As a 
        division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Standard &amp; Poor's has adopted The

        through <a href="http://www1.standardandpoors.com">www1.standardandpoors.com</a> 
        and its related sites, please be aware that different Standard &amp; Poor's 
        sites collect and use Personally Identifiable and sensitive information

        CUSTOMER PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" class="text2">The 
        McGraw-Hill Companies' Customer Privacy Policy has been developed as an 
        extension of our commitment to combine the finest quality products and 
        services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our customers. 
        The policy guides how we collect, store and use information about customers 
        and prospects, and it will be periodically assessed against new technologies, 
        business practices and our customers' changing needs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" class="text2">The 
        McGraw-Hill Companies may, from time to time, modify this Customer Privacy 
        Policy to reflect legal, technological and other developments. In that 
        event the changes will appear at this location.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" class="text2">Our 
        policy recognizes two kinds of personal data that deserve varying levels 
        of protection.<font color="#333333"> <b>Personally Identifiable Information</b></font> 
        includes, for example, e-mail addresses, billing information, employment 
        status and "click stream" data that tracks user activity on a Web site 
        or online service. A subset of that category, Sensitive Data, deserves 
        additional safeguards. <b><font color="#333333">Sensitive Data</font></b> 
        includes, for example, Social Security numbers, personal financial data 
        (such as specific salary, net worth or individual portfolio information), 
        and information about specific medical conditions.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" class="text2">The McGraw-Hill 
      Companies is committed to using all reasonable efforts to abide by the following 
      Policy statement:</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" class="text2"> 
      <ol type="1">
        <li> 
          <p><b>Collection.</b> Personally Identifiable Information will only 
            be collected to the extent that The McGraw-Hill Companies deems reasonably 
            necessary to serve a legitimate business purpose. Please be aware 
            that if you disclose Personally Identifiable Information on Web site 
            message boards or chat areas, that information may be collected and 
            used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited 
            communications from third parties. Such activities are beyond the 
            control of The McGraw-Hill Companies.</p>
        </li><li> 
          <p><b>Notification.</b> Customers and prospects will be notified (usually 
            at the point where Personally Identifiable Information is collected) 
            as to the uses the business unit may make of the Personally Identifiable 
            Information collected from them.</p>
        </li><li> 
          <p><b>Choice: Opt Out for External Distribution of Personally Identifiable 
            Information.</b> Customers and Prospects will be given the opportunity 
            to refuse permission for External Distribution of their name, address 
            or other Personally Identifiable Information through an Opt Out mechanism. 
            (External Distribution does not include certain limited distributions 
            such as sharing Personally Identifiable Information with an entity 
            working on behalf of The McGraw-Hill Companies to serve our customers; 
            transfer of Personally Identifiable Information in conjunction with 
            the sale or similar transfer of a business unit; or the disclosure 
            of Personally Identifiable Information in connection with legal proceedings, 
            investigations of crimes or other wrongdoing. However, sharing Personally 
            Identifiable Information with an entity working on behalf of The McGraw-Hill 
            Companies or transferring Personally Identifiable Information in conjunction 
            with the sale or similar transfer of a business unit is considered 
            an <font color="#333333"><b>Onward Transfer</b></font> and will be 
            handled as described below.)</p>
        </li><li> 
          <p><b>Security.</b> Appropriate safeguards will be implemented to ensure 
            the security, integrity and privacy of Personally Identifiable Information 
            about our customers and prospects.</p>
        </li><li> 
          <p><b>Access: Review and Correction.</b> Procedures have been developed 
            through which customers and prospects can, upon request, review and 
            correct the Personally Identifiable Information that has been collected 
            from them by The McGraw-Hill Companies. These procedures may not, 
            however, compromise the security, integrity and privacy of either 
            The McGraw-Hill Companies' own proprietary databases or databases 
            licensed from third party companies.</p>
        </li><li> 
          <p><b>Sensitive Data.</b> The collection and use of Sensitive Data carries 
            with it special obligations and responsibilities in order to maintain 
            the data's security, integrity and privacy. Sensitive Data will not 
            be rented or otherwise made available for External Distribution outside 
            The McGraw-Hill Companies (although it may be made available through 
            Onward Transfer as described below). Customers and prospects will 
            be given the opportunity to refuse permission for their Sensitive 
            Data to be distributed outside of the business unit that collected 
            the Sensitive Data through use of an Opt Out mechanism for Internal 
            Distribution within The McGraw-Hill Companies.</p>
          <p><b>Note:</b> Customers of units based in an EU Member State will 
            be asked for explicit consent (Opt In) to the transfer of EU Sensitive 
            Data outside of the EU, including an Internal Distribution or transfer 
            that takes place within a particular business unit of The McGraw-Hill 
            Companies.</p>
        </li><li> 
          <p><b>Onward Transfer.</b> Whenever The McGraw-Hill Companies permits 
            a third party outside of The McGraw-Hill Companies to access Personally 
            Identifiable Information through either External Distribution or Onward 
            Transfer, commercially appropriate procedures will be followed to 
            help ensure that the information is used only for authorized purposes 
            and by authorized persons in a manner consistent with the choices 
            customers and prospects have made under this policy, and that the 
            security, integrity and privacy of the information is maintained. 
            Please note that our Web site may contain links to other Web sites 
            that have their own privacy policies and practices. While The McGraw-Hill 
            Companies will employ commercially appropriate procedures to help 
            ensure that your information is only used for authorized purposes 
            as described above, The McGraw-Hill Companies cannot make any guarantees 
            with respect to the actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
          <p><b>Children:</b> Collection and use of information from children 
            under the age of thirteen will be made in compliance with the Children's 
            Online Privacy Act of 1998. Specifically, The McGraw-Hill Companies 
            will:</p>

            Companies Customer Privacy Policy has been developed out of respect 
            for the privacy preferences and choices of our customers and prospects. 
            We have established procedures to ensure that every reasonable effort 
            is made to address your concerns. Each business unit within The McGraw-Hill 
            Companies has designated a Privacy Official to implement our Customer

            find contact information on each of our business unit's Web sites 
            that collect data from you.</p>
          <p>The Corporation also has established a standing Privacy Steering 
            Committee consisting of senior corporate executives and managers from 
            our major business segments. This committee will continue to oversee 
            implementation of and compliance with our policy and will adapt the 
            Policy to reflect changes in technology and customer expectations. 
            The co-chairs of the committee are also charged with handling unresolved 
            customer concerns. You can reach them by sending an e-mail message

          <p>To ensure that we follow our stated policy, we also are conducting 
            periodic and random reviews of our Web sites and other products and 
            services. The results of our review are shared with senior management 
            and our Board of Directors. A report of our experience is available
