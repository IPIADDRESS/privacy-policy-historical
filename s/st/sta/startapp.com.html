<p><strong><em><u>Types of Data We Collect</u></em></strong></p>
<p>Depending on your interaction with our Services (meaning, if you are just browsing our Site, or if you have registered to our Services, or interact with an app, etc.), we may collect two types of data, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong><em>first type&nbsp;</em></strong>of data is non-identifiable data which may be made available or gathered via your use of the app or the Services (“<strong>Non-Personal Data</strong>”). We are not aware of the identity of our Site visitors, User or Business Partner from which the Non-Personal Data was collected. The Non-Personal Data which is being collected may include aggregated usage information and technical information transmitted by a device, including but not limited to: (i) certain software and hardware information (e.g., type of device); (ii) the session ID, the time and date you access the app or our Site, connect or disconnect to the Services, etc.; and (iii) browsing data such as: browser type, visited URL, etc. (all as detailed below).</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong><em>second type&nbsp;</em></strong>is individually identifiable data, namely data that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (“<strong>Personal Data</strong>”). Personal Data includes either: (a) information you voluntarily provide us, such as your email address and private password submitted upon registration and contact information such as your name, telephone number, address upon a submitting voluntarily request to contact us; or (b) certain identifiers such Internet Protocol (“<strong>IP</strong>”) addresses or Android ID, Advertising ID, IDFA or Device ID (“<strong>IDs</strong>”).&nbsp; Note that, while IDs are considered as personally identifiable data in many jurisdictions (such as the EEA), there are some jurisdictions in which such data is not considered as Personal Data. We treat all IDs from various jurisdictions as Personal Data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that we may collect different categories of Personal and Non-Personal Data from you depending on the nature of your interaction with the Services, as detailed below. You are not required by law to voluntarily provide us with information. You can always avoid providing us certain Personal Data; however, you acknowledge that it may prevent us from providing you certain Services. In addition, we will always treat Non-Personal Data as Personal Data if we combine it.</p>
