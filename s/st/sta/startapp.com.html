<p>The&nbsp;<em><strong>first type</strong></em>&nbsp;of information is non-identifiable information which may be made available or gathered via your use of the App Developer’s app or the Services (“<strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>”). We are not aware of the identity of the User or Business Partner from which the Non-Personal Information was collected.</p>

Please note, we consider this data to be Non-Personal Information, however, in some countries and jurisdictions this data might be considered as identifying and “Personal Information”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em><strong>second type</strong></em>&nbsp;of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”). Personal Information includes your email address and private password submitted upon registration and contact information such as your name, telephone number, address upon a submitting voluntarily request to contact us.</p>
<p>Please note that we may collect different categories of Personal and Non-Personal information from you depending on the nature of your interaction with the Services, as detailed below.

<p><strong>3. INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM USERS</strong></p>

By downloading and using the app, Users grant the App Developer with permission to collect such device information and share it with StartApp pursuant to the acceptance of the App Developer’s privacy policy. StartApp may track this information over time and across multiple apps (and may also combine the device information with Non-Personal Information from other sources) in order to deliver targeted advertisements through the Services.

</ul>
<p><strong>5. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the nature of your interaction with the Services, StartApp may collect information from you automatically or when you voluntarily choose to provide us with information, all as detailed in this Policy. We may also acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information that you voluntarily provide to us or that we collect automatically.
