<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In the event you are our Business Partner, you represent and warrant that &nbsp;you are at least 18 years of age; and you are of legal competence to enter into this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>StartApp complies with applicable legislation related to children’s privacy protection, including the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<strong>COPPA</strong>”). Thus, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from children, as they are defined under applicable law, and specifically: under the age of 13 years old, if they are located in the US; (ii) under the age of 16 years old, if they are located in the EU; (collectively: “<strong>child</strong>” or “<strong>children</strong>”),except as permitted under applicable law. Notwithstanding the above, in any event, we will not knowingly collect Personal Information from children for the purpose of behavioral advertising.</p>
<p>If we later obtain actual knowledge that a User is considered as a child under applicable law, and Personal Information was collected (other than as permitted under applicable law) we will take steps to immediately delete its Personal Information.</p>
<p>In addition, we request that children will not voluntarily provide us with Personal Information through the Services.</p>
<p>If you become aware or have any reason to believe that a child has shared any Personal Information with us, please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Support@startapp.com">contact us</a>&nbsp;and we will take steps to ensure that such Personal Information is immediately deleted from our files, to the extent required under applicable law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>DATA SECURITY, INTEGRITY AND RETENTION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your privacy is very important to StartApp and we are committed to protecting your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We have implemented physical, technical and administrative security measures for the Services that comply with applicable laws and industry standards. For more information on our security measures, please click <a href="mailto:www.startapp.com/security">here</a>.</p>
<p>Although we take reasonable steps to safeguard information, we cannot be responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access or abuse our Services, and we make no warranty, express, implied or otherwise, that we will be able to prevent such access.</p>
<p>StartApp also protects User privacy by seeking to minimize the amount of data that we store on our servers in the first place. We retain the <strong>Non-Personal Information</strong> we collected for as long as needed to provide the Service, carry out our business purpose and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements, in accordance and compliance with applicable laws, but in any event we will not keep the data longer than <u>24 months</u> in an identifiable form, or as required by law. &nbsp;Other data, such as the IDs are kept for maximum time period of <u>6 months</u> and some for less than 7 days, all as required to provide the Service and in compliance with applicable laws and legislation.</p>
<p>Further, in the event of a data breach, in which we discover your Personal Information is at risk, or might be at risk, we will notify you through the Services or, if technically possible, by sending you an email.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>TRANSFER OF DATA</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As a part of an international group, we may store or process your personal information in the United States or in other countries. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>“) we will take appropriate measures to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of data protection upon its transfer outside of the EEA. If you are a resident of a jurisdiction where transfer of your personal data requires your consent, then your consent to this Privacy Policy includes your express consent for such transfer of your data.</p>
