                  <p>This statement was last updated on March 19, 2015</p>
                  <p>This privacy policy applies to www.startsampling.com owned and operated by
                    Trillion Ventures, LLC. This privacy policy describes how StartSampling collects and
                    uses the personal information you provide on our web site: www.startsampling.com.
                    It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your
                    personal information and how you can access and update this information.</p>
                  <p>At StartSampling.com, your privacy is our priority. We are committed to
                    protecting your privacy at all times, in all situations. The information we
                    collect about you when you become a member is used to process your sample
                    orders and to provide a more personalized sampling experience on our site.</p>
                  <p><strong>How Do We Use the Information We Collect?</strong><br>
                    When you become a StartSampling member, we ask you to fill out a form that
                    requests your name, address and e-mail address as well as some demographic
                    information such as gender and date of birth.<br>
                    StartSampling may share data with trusted partners to help us perform
                    statistical analysis. All such third parties are prohibited from using your
                    information except to provide these services to StartSampling and they are
                    required to maintain confidentiality.</p>
                  <p>Your name and address information is used solely to process sample orders
                    unless your prior consent is given. Without your consent, this information
                    will NEVER be sold, given, rented or traded to others for purposes other than
                    sample order fulfillment.</p>
                  <p>Your demographic information (gender, date of birth, etc.) is used for
                    several purposes:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Demographic information is provided back to our customers (companies that
                      provide us with product samples for you to select) in an aggregated way.
                      For example, we may tell a customer that 65% of our members who selected
                      their samples were male while 35% were female. We never release individual
                      demographics to a customer or any other party without your consent, except
                      to the extent necessary for order fulfillment. These parties are
                      contractually obligated with StartSampling to use your information only for
                      the purposes of shipping your samples.</li>
                    <li>StartSampling uses demographic information in aggregated terms to tailor
                      our sales efforts.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Refer-A-Friend</strong><br>
                   If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we
                   will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically
                   send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.
                   StartSampling does not store this information and uses it for the sole purpose
                   of sending this one-time email.</p>
                  <p><strong>Our Use of Log Files</strong><br>
                    When you visit our site we automatically log your IP address, your browser
                    type and your access times. We utilize this information to conduct site
                    performance evaluations, to see where visitors are coming from and to keep
                    track of click stream data (the screens our users visit on our site). This
                    data helps us to determine what content our members find most appealing so
                    that we can maximize your enjoyment of the site. We may also combine log
                    file data with demographic information in aggregate form to analyze trends.
                    For example we may find that in general, men prefer different site features
                    than women. We may also combine log files with cookie information to
                    aggregate information. Log files are not tied to personally identifiable
                    information.</p>
                  <p><strong>Site Security</strong><br>
                    All StartSampling employees take your personal information very seriously.
                    All employees must learn and obey our security policies. Access to member
                    personal information is limited to key management personnel and our member
                    services department. The information is ID and password protected and our
                    Web security is reviewed on a monthly basis.</p>
                  <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal
                    information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive
                    it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
                    storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use
                    commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we
                    cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                  <p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact
                    us by <a href="mailto:support@startsampling.com">clicking here</a>.</p>
                  <p><strong>Use of Intermediaries</strong><br>
                    StartSampling utilizes the services of an intermediary - the U.S. Postal
                    Service - to send out the samples our subscribers have selected. To our
                    knowledge, the U.S. Postal Service does not store, retain or use the
                    information in any way. In some cases, we also use the order fulfillment
                    services of third parties to get samples to you. These parties are
                    contractually obligated with StartSampling to use your information
                    only for the purpose of shipping your samples.</p>
                  <p><strong>Correcting/Updating Your Personal Information</strong><br>
                    After becoming a StartSampling subscriber you may correct/update/deactivate
                    your personal information by clicking on the 'My Account' link at the top
                    of any page, entering your ID, password and birth date when prompted and
                    clicking the Edit Information button. The changes you make will be
                    reflected in our databases instantly. If you wish to deactivate your
                    account, you may contact our member services group through the 'My
                    Account' section.</p>
                  <p><strong>Data Retention</strong><br>
                    We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as
                    needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as
                    necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
                    enforce our agreements.</p>
                  <p><strong>Links To Other Sites</strong><br>
                    This Web site contains links to other Web sites. Please note that when you
                    click on one of these links, you may be leaving the StartSampling site and
                    entering another Web site. These sites may independently collect or
                    request information about you and we encourage you to read the privacy
                    statements of these linked sites as their privacy policy may differ from
                    ours.</p>
                  <p><strong>Posting Information</strong><br>
                    If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this Web site, you
                    should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit
                    there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and
                    could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for
                    the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these
                    forums. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or
                    community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@startsampling.com">
                    support@startsampling.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove
                    your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are
                    unable to do so and why.</p>
                  <p><strong>Communication</strong><br>
                    From time to time we may send out email messages alerting you that samples
                    are available, to remind you about providing feedback or for promotional
                    offers. In addition, you will receive communication from us 1) if you
                    contact us for a particular reason, 2) to receive your samples, or 3) we
                    need to contact you for administrative purposes such as winning a contest.
                    You may <a href="contactus.iphtml">click here</a> to opt out of promotional
                    e-mails by contacting our member services group. Administrative e-mails
                    will not contain promotional materials.</p>
                  <p><strong>Opt-In/Opt-Out Opportunities</strong><br>
                    StartSampling provides you with opt-in opportunities in two ways. First, our
                    site will give you the opportunity to provide more information to us in
                    exchange for Frequent Tryer Miles. These additional forms and surveys are completely
                    optional. The information you provide if you choose to fill out these forms
                    and surveys may be used to tailor offerings to you and may be shared - in
                    aggregate terms only - with our customers. Second, in some cases, there
                    will be opportunities to opt-in to allow manufacturers to contact you
                    directly. If you choose to participate in these instances, your information
                    may be shared with the specified provider. In some cases these events are
                    set up using an opt-out approach. In either case, you will always have the
                    ability to choose whether you want to participate in these opportunities,
                    but in some cases you will only be allowed to receive a sample or
                    participate in an offer if you agree to share your information.</p>
                  <p>If you have opted in to be contacted by a third party and then want to opt
                    out of being contacted by that party, you will have to follow the opt out
                    process used by that company. If you have opted in to allow StartSampling to
                    allow third parties to contact you, can opt out of that by contacting us by
                    <a href="optout.iphtml">clicking here</a>.</p>
                  <p><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong><br>
                    We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways
                    that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal
                    information to third parties.</p>
                  <p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to
                    disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a
                    good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current
                    judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.
                    </p>
                  <p>If StartSampling is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a
                    portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent
                    notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal
                    information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal
                    information.</p>
                  <p><strong>Supplementation</strong><br>
                    We may correct or supplement your address information with standardized
                    postal representation in order to ensure that your samples get delivered.
                    We do this since we want to make sure that our members receive the samples
                    they order and to lower costs associated with our sample programs.</p>
                  <p><strong>Contests</strong><br>
                    Periodically, contests are run on our site. Sometimes contests are
                    sponsored by our customers. To enter these contests you need only to enter
                    your ID and password and your guess. At the time of entry, you may decide
                    if you wish to have your first name and state posted on our site if you are
                    the winner. Winners names are NEVER shared with our customers without their
                    consent.</p>
                  <p>StartSampling may also offer our members the opportunity to participate in
                    contests or sweepstakes from third parties. In these cases you will be
                    linked to the third party web site and you may be asked for personal
                    information, such as name, address, gender etc. This information is
                    collected by the third party and will be used in accordance with their
                    privacy policy. Please read the privacy information posted on the third
                    party site to make sure you are comfortable with it before entering your
                    information.</p>
