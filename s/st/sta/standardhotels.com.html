By providing Personal Information to us, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We may use a third-party payment service to process payments made through the Services. If you wish to make a payment through the Services, your Personal Information may be collected by such third party and not by us and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third party’s collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information. </p>

<p>If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>How We May Collect Personal Information </h3>

<p>We and our service providers may collect Personal Information in a variety of ways, including: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Through the Services</strong>: We may collect Personal Information through the Services, such as when you sign up for our Wi-Fi, sign-up or opt-in as a subscriber to Standard Culture or make a purchase or booking.</li>
<li><strong>From Other Sources</strong>: We may receive your Personal Information from other sources, such as public databases; joint marketing partners; online travel/restaurant companies; booking engines; social media platforms; people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms; and other third parties. For example, if you choose to connect your social media account to your Website account, certain Personal Information from your social media account will be shared with us, and it may include Personal Information that is part of your profile or your friends’ profiles. </li>
</ul>

<h3>How We May Use Personal Information</h3>
<p>We may use Personal Information: </p>
<ul>

Some of these activities have additional rules, which could contain additional information about how we use and disclose your Personal Information, so we suggest that you read such rules carefully.</li>
<li>To facilitate social sharing functionality.</li>
<li>To allow you to send messages to a friend through the Services. By using this functionality, you are telling us that you are authorized to use and provide us with your friend’s name and email address. </li>
<li>For our business purposes, such as data analysis; market research; surveys; customer satisfaction; audits; fraud monitoring and prevention; developing new products and services; enhancing, improving or modifying our Services; identifying usage trends; determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and operating and expanding our business activities. </li>

</ul>

<h3>How Personal Information May Be Disclosed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your Personal Information may be disclosed: </li>
<li>To our affiliates within the Standard brand portfolio for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Standard International Management LLC is the party responsible for the management of the jointly-used Personal Information. This sharing with our affiliates allows us to provide you with information about all of our locations and amenities that may be of interest to you. Any commercial email sent by an affiliate will include an opportunity to not receive such email messages in the future. </li>
<li>To our third party service providers who provide services such as website hosting, data analysis, data analytics, payment processing, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, email delivery, auditing and other services. For example, we may use Google Analytics and others to provide analytics. </li>

<li>To third-party sponsors of sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions.</li>
<li>To identify you to anyone to whom you send messages through the Services.</li>
<li>By you, on message boards, chat, profile pages, blogs and other services to which you are able to post information and materials. Please note that any information you post or disclose through these services will become public and may be available to other users of the Services and to the general public. We urge you to be very careful when deciding to disclose your Personal Information, or any other information, on the Services.</li>
<li>To your friends associated with your social media account, to other users of the Services and to your social media account provider, in connection with your social sharing activity, such as if you connect your social media account to your Services account or log into your Services account from your social media account. By connecting your Services account and your social media account, you authorize us to share information with your social media account provider, and you understand that the use of the information we share will be governed by the social media site’s own privacy policy. If you do not want your Personal Information shared in this way, do not connect your social media account with your Services account, and do not participate in social sharing on the Services.</li>
<li>To a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</li>
<li>As we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Browser and device information</li>
<li>App usage data</li>
<li>Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies</li>
<li>Demographic information and other information provided by you</li>
<li>Aggregated information</li>
</ul>

<h3>How We May Collect Other Information / Online Tracking</h3>
<p>We and our third party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Through your browser or device</strong>: Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the Services (such as the App) you are using. We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly. </li>
<li><strong>Through your use of the App</strong>: When you download and use the App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number. </li>
<li><strong>Using cookies</strong>: Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using. They allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, your location, language preferences and anonymous traffic data. We and our service providers use the information for such purposes as security, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience, to understand how the Services are used, to improve the Services and to assist us with resolving questions regarding them. Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Services. We may also use cookies to track responses to our online advertisements. We do not track your activities when you are on third-party websites, but we or our service providers may track your actions with respect to our ads placed on third-party websites. We do not honor browser do-not-track signals at this time.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You may also wish to refer to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html</a>. If, however, you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, so you may need to log in every time you visit. You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that are relevant to your interests and needs. </p>
<p>We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other, similar technologies to collect information about use of the Services and reports website trends, without identifying individual visitors. You can learn about Google’s practices and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using pixel tags and</strong> <strong>other similar technologies</strong>: We and our service providers may use pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) in connection with the Services to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services and response rates. </li>
<li><strong>Using Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Shared Objects (“Flash LSOs”)) and other similar technologies</strong>: We may use Flash LSOs and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Services. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Website Storage Settings Panel</a>. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">Global Storage Settings Panel</a> and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Services or our online content. </li>
<li><strong>IP Address</strong>: Your “<strong>IP Address</strong>” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, helping diagnose server problems and administering the Services.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Location:</strong> We may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or WiFi signals. We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content. </li>
<li><strong>From you</strong>: Information, such as your gender or preferred means of communication, is collected when you voluntarily provide it. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you.</li>
<li><strong>By aggregating information</strong>: We may aggregate users’ Personal Information (for example, we may calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).
