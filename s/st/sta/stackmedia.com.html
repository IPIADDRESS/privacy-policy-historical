Cookies<br><br>

Each web site and service owned and operated by stackmedia.com uses cookies. A cookie is a small text file of which there are three types:<br>
Session cookies: These are used to maintain something called session state. If you consider your journey through the site to be a conversation with us and this cookie just reminds the site where we were in that conversation (for instance if at some point in the conversation you asked us to add a movie or service to your basket, next time you click on the basket it is still there). These are required for the site to function but are not used in any way to identify you personally.<br><br>

Permanent cookies: These store a few numbers on your hard drive. You can view them by looking in the cookies directory of your browser installation if you are interested. They last for a long time and each time you come to our site you send us a copy of them. We use them to identify you between visits.  They are not required for the site to work but may enhance your experience. We do not store any personal data in these cookies, just a unique number that identifies you to us.<br><br>

Third Party Cookies: You may have noticed that we carry advertising from third parties on our site. Occasionally they may send you a cookie. We have no control over these.<br><br>

Although you cannot block "session" cookies as they are required for our site to function correctly you can configure your internet browser so that it can reject both "permanent" and "third party" cookies. How you do this will depend upon the internet browser you use (for example, Internet Explorer 5, Netscape 4 or Opera etc) and it is therefore impractical for us to detail here how you can reject those cookies. Please refer to the relevant internet browser creator's website where you should be able to receive all the information you need."<br><br>

Third Party Advertising<br>
Ads that may appear on this Web site or other services are delivered to you, on our behalf, by us or our Web advertising partner. Information about your visit to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or any other personal information), is used to serve ads.<br><br>

Data<br>
In the USA we operate in accordance with applicable data protection legislation.<br><br>

Consent<br>
By disclosing your personal information to us using this website or over the telephone, you consent to the collection, storage and processing of your personal information by stackmedia.com in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy. Some information and e-mails sent to stackmedia.com may be used as testimonials but no e-mail address or contact details will be displayed.<br><br>

Opt-Out Policy<br>
Send an email to help@stackmedia.com or click on the unsubscribe button on the email that you receive to opt out of any newsletters or email that you may receive from us. <br><br>
