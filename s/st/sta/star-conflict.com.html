Yandex will process this information to assess how you use the games and websites, compile reports for us in terms of our website operation, and provide other services. Yandex processes this information as specified in the ‘Terms of Use’ for the Yandex Metrics service. You can stop using cookies by making the relevant adjustments in your browser settings.

<p>5.3. <strong>Advertising partners.</strong> We may share some of Your user data (i.e. e-mail) where this is necessary for the publication, personalization (targeting) of advertisements, or for accounting purposes in relation to the advertising services being rendered by our advertising partners.</p>

<p>5.4. <strong>Tracking partners.</strong> We allow our partners to track the number of impressions and installations, as well as other indicators of the effectiveness of our adverts and, in this respect, they have the right to process some of your user data. For instance, we use the Facebook tracking service. Please have a look at their privacy policy: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation">https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation</a>.</p>

<p>5.5. <strong>Operating partners.</strong> We may share any and all of your user data with our partners where those partners provide the following services: (a) hosting; (b) user support; (c) testing; and (d) statistical and marketing research or data analysis.</p>

<p>5.6. <strong>2FA providers.</strong> We may share your data (such as your mobile phone number) with partners who provide ‘Two Factor Authentication’ services.</p>

<p>5.7. <strong>Payment partners/licensees.</strong> When you purchase something via our official online store at: https://store.gaijin.net, we share with our payment partners your player ID and the value of the payment. In some cases we will also share your email address, nickname, IP address, and the date of your registration in the game with our licensees who help us to operate the game and receive payments.</p>

<p>5.8. <strong>Partners for protection against cheats and unfair play.</strong> We use different services to protect our users from cheats and unfair play, including the ‘EasyAntiCheat’ service (referred to hereinafter as ‘Easy Anti-Cheat’), which are operated by a third-party service provider who offers services to us. Easy Anti-Cheat and other, similar services have a client software (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Client’) that is integrated into the games (where applicable). When you start a new game session the client will automatically load and install its latest version into the unit. When you are using the game on your unit, Easy Anti-Cheat (as well as other similar services) will monitor the unit, analysing the game binaries and scanning the unit’s memory for the purpose of detecting and preventing cheating in the game (hereinafter referred to as ‘Game Protection’). For this purpose, Easy Anti-Cheat (as well as other similar services) will store information regarding cheating methods that can be used in the game (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Data’). The data will contain your personal data as described in the privacy statement for Easy Anti-Cheat. By installing, copying, or otherwise using the game, you provide your consent that Easy Anti-Cheat (as well as other similar services) may gather, store, share, and publish data for the sole purpose of game protection. You also acknowledge and agree that the processing activities of Easy Anti-Cheat (as well as other similar services) include automated decision-making which may have a significant effect upon you as you may be banned from the game if you have been found to be cheating in it. The data will be used solely for game protection, including but not limited to identifying and banning player accounts which are used for cheating in computer games, analysing cheating behaviour and cheating codes, and also for sharing data about cheats with affiliates of Easy Anti-Cheat (as well as other, similar service). You are entitled to use the game only in accordance with applicable terms and conditions and the Easy Anti-Cheat privacy statement at: <a href="https://www.easy.ac/en-us/support/ragnarok/account/privacy/">www.easyanticheat.net/privacy/</a>.</p>

<p>5.9. <strong>Licensees, assignees, and purchasers.</strong> If we decide to assign the exclusive rights in and to the game, appoint the licensee to operate the game, sell the shares of Gaijin Network Ltd to a purchaser, or agree a merger with another company, we may share your user data to the assignee, licensee, or purchaser, or a new legal entity which is formed as a result of a merger by Gaijin Network Ltd with another company, without seeking your additional consent.</p>

<p>5.10. <strong>Affiliates.</strong> Being an international company which operates worldwide, we may share any and all of your user data with our affiliates (ie. the companies which control us, or which are under our control, or which are under common control along with us), and any subsidiaries. We take all reasonable measures to ensure the confidentiality of your user data.</p>

<p>5.11. <strong>Auditors.</strong> From time to time Gaijin Network Ltd. and its affiliates may hire third-party auditing companies and therefore some of your user data (for example, your User ID, email address, list of in-game purchases) may be transferred to such companies solely for the purpose of auditing.</p>

<p>In the future, we may enter into contracts with other partners. If this is the case then we will make every reasonable effort to update the list of our partners which is provided in this privacy policy in a timely manner at least once every six months, or more often in the event of a significant change in our data processing practices.</p>

<p>We operate all over the world, and therefore we may transfer your user data to our partners in different countries, including those which are located outside the European Union or European Economic Area. We guarantee an adequate level of personal data protection in each case. We take all reasonable steps to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data when it is transferred to countries which are located outside the European Union or European Economic Area, including but not limited to, by entering into standard data protection terms which have been adopted by the European Commission with third parties who are located outside the European Union or European Economic Area (a copy of which we will provide upon request).</p>

<p>You have the right to have inaccurate personal data amended. You can change some data about you directly via the game settings (such as, for example, your nickname or profile in a social network which is linked to your game profile).

<p>Our games and services are not aimed at children under the age of thirteen (as well as children who have not reached any applicable ages of consent in accordance with applicable legislation), and we do not intentionally collect or solicit personal data from minors. If we learn that we have unintentionally collected personal data from a child under thirteen (or a child who has not reached the age of consent in accordance with applicable legislation) without the consent of that child’s holder of parental responsibility, we will take all reasonable steps to erase this information as soon as possible. If you find out that your child has provided us with their personal data without your consent, please contact us at: privacy@gaijin.net. Please provide us with conclusive evidence that (a) personal data was provided by a child who has not yet reached the minimum age of consent in accordance with applicable legislation, and (b) that you are the minor’s holder of parental responsibility.</p>

<p>[For our European users:</p>

<p>We do not exactly know the age of our users, but before their first game log-in, we always ask each user whether they have reached the age of thirteen or whichever other age may be required in accordance with the applicable legislation of their particular country of origin (the age of consent within the European Union varies from thirteen to sixteen years, depending upon the country in question), and without confirmation of this fact we do not grant access to the game to such a user. Children who have not reached the age of consent in accordance with their country’s legislation may use our games and the website only upon receipt of the consent of their holder of parental responsibility.]</p>

<p><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>We retain any of your personal data which we collect for as long as your game account is active, and for as long as it is necessary to provide you with access to the games, and while we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data, from the moment we receive your personal data until the moment at which we erase your personal data in accordance with article 6.4. Please note that some of your user data, as set forth in article 6.4, will not be erased even after we have complied with your deletion request. We also erase your personal data after reaching the goal for which we collected such data (ie. data as set out in clauses 2.1.4 and 2.1.5).</p>

<p><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>9. INFORMATION SECURITY </strong></p>
