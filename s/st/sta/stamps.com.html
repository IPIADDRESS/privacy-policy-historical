<p><strong>NOTICE: <a href="/go?www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee.htm" target="_blank" class="stndlink">Click here</a> for important information about safe surfing from the Federal Trade Commission.</strong></p>
<p><span class="subtitles">What This Privacy Policy Covers</span>
</p><p>
	</p><ul>
		<li>This policy covers how Stamps.com treats personal information that Stamps.com collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Stamps.com products or services, such as the Stamps.com PC Postage service and the PhotoStamps service, as well as non-personal information collected from our Web site. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number.</li>
	</ul>
<p></p>
<p><span class="subtitles">Information Collection and Use</span></p>
<p>
	</p><ul>
		<li>Stamps.com collects personal information from you only when you choose to share it with us, such as when you register with Stamps.com, or when you use Stamps.com products or services. Stamps.com may also combine information we have about you with information we receive from business partners or other companies.  For instance, we may offer a special promotion or service in conjunction with a business partner if your permission is provided.  Our goal is to provide you, the user, with great service and products, and a customer-friendly experience using our service and on our site. This includes online shopping, interactive communications, and many other types of services.</li>
		<li>We collect personal information from you as follows: When you register or you order products we ask for information such as your name, email address, home address and contact information. Stamps.com also collects postage service payment information that includes your credit card number, expiration date and billing address. In addition with the Stamps.com PC Postage service, in order to generate valid indicia, Stamps.com collects and records the following information: date and time of transaction, unique transaction ID, amount of postage used in the transaction and recipient ZIP Code. To deliver enhanced security and personalized service we also collect and record your MAC address and information about your printer. Stamps.com also collects information from the Stamps.com Customer Support and Affiliate Sign-Up forms and such information is used for the purpose for which it was collected, such as to communicate with you regarding your order.</li>
		<li>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Stamps.com does not store this information and it is used for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.</li>
		<li>Cookies: Stamps.com automatically receives and records certain non-personal information about your visit through the use of cookies. Cookies are files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. Information collected includes your IP address, your referral source, and the page(s) you request.</li>
		<li>Generally, we use cookies to:
			<ul>
				<li>Fulfill your requests for products and services, and improve our services.</li>
				<li>Remind us of who you are on return visits in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you first visit the Stamps.com Web site.</li>
				<li>Estimate our audience size and measure traffic patterns regarding usage of Stamps.com's network of Web sites. Each browser accessing Stamps.com is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage and usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user.</li>
				<li>Track the number of entries in our promotions.</li>
				<li>Customize the advertising and content you see.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If you are uncomfortable having a cookie placed on your system, you may elect to turn off the cookie or delete existing cookies in your browser. If you turn off or delete the Stamps.com cookie, you may not be able to receive special offers or personalized content from Stamps.com.</li>
		<li>We use a third party tracking utility service that uses cookies to track and analyze aggregate user movement. We also use clear gifs and JavaScript in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</li>
	</ul>
<p></p>
