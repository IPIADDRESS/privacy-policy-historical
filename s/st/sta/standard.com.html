<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<!--- Insert body text --->
<p>The privacy of your personal information is important to us. To help you understand how we protect the information we receive about you, this notice describes our current privacy policy and practices.</p>

<p>We want you to know that:</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not sell or rent the information we have about you to anyone;</li>
<li>We do not share your information with outside companies for the purpose of selling their products or services to you; and</li>
<li>We do not offer a right to opt out since we only share information about you with others as permitted or required by law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information We May Collect and From Whom</h2>
<p>We collect your personal information to offer you insurance and financial products and services. The type of information we collect and the extent to which it is used depends on the products and services we provide to you. For example, we may obtain information such as:

</p><ul>
<li>Your name, address, date of birth, telephone number, Social Security number, employment, occupation, assets and income from applications and other forms from you, your employer and others;</li>
<li>Your policy coverage, claims, premiums and payment history from your dealings with us;</li>
<li>Your financial and medical history from other insurance companies, the Medical Information Bureau ("MIB") or consumer reporting agencies, if you apply for life or disability insurance;</li>
<li>Your current and past health condition from medical providers or facilities, with your authorization, if you apply for life or disability insurance; and </li>
<li>Your use of the services offered on our Web sites from online information collection devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may request an insurance support organization to collect information that we need about you. If we do, they will submit a report to us. They may keep a copy of the report and share its contents with others. They will do this only with appropriate authorization from you.</p>

<h2>Information We May Disclose</h2>
<p>We may share the types of information described above with others. These disclosures are only made as authorized by you or as permitted or required by law. These may include disclosures:</p>
<ul>
<li>To others that perform business services or functions on our behalf or to serve you;</li>
<li>To employers, to reinsurers, to other insurance companies, and to the MIB for purposes related to insurance you may have or apply for;</li>
<li>To others that may have a joint marketing agreement with us, unless state law restricts such use;</li>
<li>To insurance departments in connection with the regulation of our business;</li>
<li>To law enforcement agencies to help prevent fraud or illegal activities;</li>
<li>To government agencies to comply with the law; and</li>
<li>To authorized persons to respond to a subpoena, warrant or other court order.</li>
</ul>

<p>When information about you is disclosed to others, we expect them to protect your information. We expect them to use the information only for the limited purpose for which it was shared. We do not share medical information except with your authorization or as permitted or required by law.</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>We want to make sure that we have accurate information about you. In general, you have the right to review your personal information that we have. If you believe that any of the information about you is not accurate, you may inform us in writing of any changes you believe should be made. We will review your request and respond to it accordingly.</p>

<h2>Confidentiality and Security</h2>
<p>We restrict access to information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain written privacy policies, as well as physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information.</p>

<h2>Further Information</h2>
<p>We will advise you of our privacy policy at least once a year. We may change our privacy policy at any time. As long as you remain a customer, we will inform you of any changes. If your relationship with us ends, we will continue to limit disclosures of your information in accordance with our stated privacy policy.</p>

<!--<p>We take very seriously our obligation to protect the personal information you share with us. "Personal information" means information that identifies you personally and is not otherwise available to the public.</p>
<p>It may include personal financial information, such as credit history, income, policy or claim information. If you apply for insurance products, such as life or disability insurance, it may also include personal health information, such as individual medical records or information about an illness, disability or injury, which we collect only 
with your prior authorization.</p>
<p>We do not share our customers&#146; personal information with unaffiliated third parties for purposes unrelated to processing applications, issuing and servicing policies or administering claims. Nor do we sell our customers&#146; personal information. For those reasons we do not have an opt out provision in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<div class="head3">Information We May Collect and From Whom</div>
<p>We collect personal information about you to offer you insurance and financial products and services, and to support our normal business practices. The type of information we collect and the extent to which it is used varies depending on the products or services you purchase from us.</p>

<p>We may obtain personal information about you from applications and other forms you submit to us, from your transactions and dealings with us and others, from consumer reporting agencies, and from other sources, such as our Web sites, other insurers, and medical professionals.</p>

<div class="head3">For example: </div>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><ul>
<li>We may obtain information such as your name, address, telephone number, social security number, taxpayer identification number, assets, income, and beneficiaries from applications and other forms you submit to us.

<li>We may obtain information such as credit worthiness or credit history, medical claims, and medical history from consumer reporting agencies.
<li>We may obtain information based on your use of our Web sites such as the name of your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer&#146;s operating system and Web browser, and your use of the information, products, and services offered via our Web sites.
</ul>
<P>If you believe that any of this information about you is inaccurate, you may notify us in writing of any corrections, amendments, or deletions that you believe should be made. We will promptly investigate your request, determine if it is appropriate to make any change and respond accordingly.</P>
</font>
<div class="head3">Information We May Disclose</div>
<p>In the course of conducting our business there are circumstances in which we may disclose to other parties the information we collect about you, as described above. These disclosures are only made as permitted or required by law, such as disclosures to affiliates, reinsurers, and organizations that perform services or functions on our behalf or to serve you and to regulatory, law enforcement and governmental authorities.</p>

<p>For example, as permitted or required by law, we may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, 
to companies or organizations that perform marketing or administrative services for us 
or to other financial institutions (such as banks, insurance companies, securities brokers or dealers) with which we have 
joint marketing agreements.</p>

<p>When information is disclosed to a third party to perform services or functions on 
our behalf, we expect them to adhere to procedures and practices that maintain the confidentiality of your personal information, to use the information only for the limited purpose for which it was shared, and to abide by all applicable privacy laws.</p>

<p>We do not share medical information except with your prior authorization or as permitted or required by law.</p>

<div class="head3">Confidentiality and Security</div>

and procedural safeguards to protect your information.</p>

<div class="head3">Further Information </div>
<p>We may change our privacy policy at any time. As long as you remain a customer, we will notify you of any modifications as required by law. Should your relationship with us end, we will continue to limit disclosures of your information in accordance with our stated privacy policy. </p>-->
