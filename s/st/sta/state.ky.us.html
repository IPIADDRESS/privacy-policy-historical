<font face="Arial" size="3">

</font><p><font face="Arial" size="3">Your privacy and security are our highest priority. Ensuring electronic access to state
government information and services while maintaining privacy is a guiding principle of
the state's <a href="http://www.state.ky.us/kirm/sitp/sitp.htm">Strategic Information
Technology Plan</a>. The Commonwealth of Kentucky collects only the personal information
necessary to provide enhanced services to our citizens and customers. Please note that all
non-exempt information collected by KyDirect services may be subject to public disclosure
under KRS 61.870, the Kentucky Open Records Act. However, public records containing
information of a personal nature are protected from disclosure by the personal privacy
exemption of state law. Personal data in our possession is maintained and used in ways
that respect individual privacy. The Commonwealth educates our employees about the
importance of protecting personal information and consumer privacy, and only authorized
employees have access to personal information.</font></p>

Information Sharing&nbsp; </span></font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">KyDirect will not release personal information to third
parties except where it is already provided by law for purposes of notification. We will
not provide, rent or sell personal information to third parties for marketing programs or
any other purpose. State law restricts the use of personally identifiable information for
commercial purposes. Depending on the specific nature of the service, information may be
shared with other state agencies as stated in <a href="http://www.lrc.state.ky.us/krs/061-00/878.pdf">KRS 61.878 (5)</a>. This statute
allows for the exchange of public records or sharing of information between public
agencies when the exchange is serving a legitimate governmental need or is necessary in
the performance of a legitimate government function.</font></p>

KyDirect sites may use cookies to customize and personalize your service transactions with

Security Notice&nbsp; </span></font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">KyDirect uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to
safeguard your sensitive personal information, including your credit card number, during
online transactions. Using this widely accepted form of encryption, your transaction is
secured from your personal computer to the KyDirect computer processing your request. The
KyDirect processing computers are located behind a secure firewall. For your protection,
never put your credit card number or other sensitive information in unencrypted e-mail.
For added security, your credit card information is not stored on a state government
database and only authorized employees have access to your credit card number for card
processing purposes.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="3">

</font><p><font face="Arial" size="3">SSL is highly regarded to be a very safe encryption method, but we fully understand if
you are not comfortable entering your credit card information online. In that event,
please telephone the agency using the toll-free number and speak directly to an agency
representative.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">If you have trouble purchasing securely at our web site,
then you may be behind a firewall or using a proxy server that doesn't allow for secure
transactions. If that is the case, then you may phone or fax your order.</font></p>
