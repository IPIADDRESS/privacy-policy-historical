<p></p></dt><dt>If personal information is requested on the Web site or volunteered by the user, State law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it.

Your Web browser can be configured to refuse cookies or to notify you when a Web site attempts to send you a cookie. Cookie files can also be found and deleted from your computer's hard drive.
