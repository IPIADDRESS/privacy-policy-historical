To request removal of your child's information, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:legal@cheyenneme.com">legal@cheyenneme.com</a> and be sure to include in your message the same user name, password, and email address that your child submitted.<span class="backTop">[ <a href="#top">Top</a> ]</span></p>
