				<h2>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY:</h2>
				<p>The Site complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. </p>
				<p><strong>Children under the age of 13</strong></p>
				<p>Because  the Site is not directed to children under the age of 13, Cheyenne  Mountain does not provide memberships or registration to persons under  age 13. If you are under the age of 13, you may not create an account  on the Site, you may not sign up for any subscription service or buy  anything through the Site, and you are not eligible to enter any of  Cheyenne Mountain's sweepstakes or promotions.

Do not post your real name on a  web site or message board, and never tell anyone online anything  private about yourself or your family, including your phone number and  address. Use screen names at all times. If you win a sweepstakes that  has a prize, your parent or guardian will have to mail or fax us a  signed note at the address or fax number listed in the rules for the  specific contest that says it was OK for you to enter, and tells us  they will accept the prize for you. Some areas of the Site may have  special rules for children under the age of 18. When you are in those  areas, you must follow those rules.</p>
				<p><strong>Information for Parents/Guardians</strong></p>
				<p>Cheyenne  Mountain encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with  their children to become familiar with the types of content available  on the internet, including Cheyenne Mountain's online games. Parents  and guardians should regularly oversee their children's use of e-mail  and other online communications and transactional features. Control  tools are available from online services and software manufacturers  that can help provide a safe online environment for kids.</p>
				<p>If  you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child has  submitted his or her personal information without your permission or  consent, we will take reasonable steps to promptly remove that  information from our database at your request. To request removal of  your child's information, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:legal@cheyenneme.com">legal@cheyenneme.com</a> and be sure to include in your message the same user name, password, and email address that your child submitted.</p>
