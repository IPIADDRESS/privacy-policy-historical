				<a id="children" name="children"></a>

				<h4>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY:</h4>

				<p>The Firesky Sites comply with the Children's  Online Privacy Protection Act. </p>

				<p><strong>Children under the age of 13</strong></p>

				<p>Because the Firesky Sites are not directed to  children under the age of 13, Firesky does not provide memberships or  registration to persons under age 13. If you are under the age of 13, you may  not create an account on the Firesky Sites, you may not sign up for or  participate in any Service, or buy anything through the Firesky Sites, and you  are not eligible to enter any of Firesky's sweepstakes or promotions. Except as  may be required by law, Firesky will not knowingly collect, maintain, or  disclose any personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>

				<p><strong>Children between the ages of 13 and 18</strong></p>

				<p>If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, please  let your parent or guardian know about this Privacy Policy and get his or her  permission before you give us any of your personal identifiable information,  before you use any of our message board, instant message or chat features,  before you sign up or participate in any Services, and before you buy anything  from the Firesky Sites. Do not post your real name on a web site or message  board, and never tell anyone online anything private about yourself or your family,  including your phone number and address. Use screen names at all times. If you  win a sweepstakes that has a prize, your parent or guardian will have to mail  or fax us a signed note at the address or fax number listed in the rules for  the specific contest that says it was OK for you to enter, and tells us they  will accept the prize for you. Some areas of the Firesky Sites may have special  rules for children under the age of 18. When you are in those areas, you must  follow those rules.</p>

				<p><strong>Information for Parents/Guardians</strong></p>

				<p>Firesky encourages parents and guardians to spend  time online with their children to become familiar with the types of content  available on the internet, including Firesky's online games. Parents and  guardians should regularly oversee their children's use of e-mail and other  online communications and transactional features. Control tools are available  from online services and software manufacturers that can help provide a safe  online environment for kids.</p>

				<p>If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered  that your child has submitted his or her personal information without your  permission or consent, we will take reasonable steps to promptly remove that  information from our database at your request. To request removal of your  child's information, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:legal@firesky.com">legal@firesky.com</a> and be sure to include in your message the same user name, password, and email  address that your child submitted.</p>
				<div class="ele_link">[ <a href="http://community.stargateworlds.com/privacy/#top">Top</a> ]</div>

				<p>The Firesky Sites may from time to time contain  links to third-party web sites. Firesky is not responsible for the privacy  practices or the content of such web sites. If you are concerned about the  privacy policy of a certain third party, you may contact them directly or visit  their individual web sites to learn more about their individual privacy  policies.</p>
