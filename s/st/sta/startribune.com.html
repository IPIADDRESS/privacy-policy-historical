PRIVACYPOLICY
</small></span></div>
</div>
<div id="storytext">
<span class="fontsize2">
<p>Startribune.com has a firm commitment to privacy. We take your privacy concerns 
  seriously and want to make every effort to address them as we strive to offer 
  our site visitors a high quality, interactive and personalized experience. That 
  is why we have adopted the following policy, which explains our position on 
  information gathering and how we intend to use and share any information we 
  collect. It is important to note that this policy applies only to information 
  collected by startribune.com and does not apply to information obtained or used 
  by Star Tribune or its affiliates through other means.</p>
<p>Startribune.com collects and stores Personally Identifiable Information such 
  as your name, address, e-mail address, etc. What information we collect and 
  store depends on the page you are visiting and the services you elect to participate 
  in. We use this information to operate our services, provide you with the highest 
  quality services, offer you opportunities we think will be of interest, and 
  better tailor the advertising you see from us to suit you. This information 
  is not shared with anyone outside of Star Tribune and startribune.com except 
  as provided for in this Privacy Policy. More specifics on the information we 
  collect are outlined within this policy. </p>
<p>This privacy policy is subject to change from time to time. If the policy is 
  revised, a notice will be placed in the Member Center where registered members 
  of our service may also update their personal information, subscribe to e-mail 
  newsletters and revise the permissions that they previously granted startribune.com. 
  They may also receive an e-mail outlining the change. Non-registered users of 
  startribune.com may view the privacy policy, including any revisions, by clicking 
  on the "Privacy Policy" link on the home page of startribune.com. 
  If the changes represent a material departure from our current policy or materially 
  affect users' rights and obligations, if feasible, the changes will be posted 
  on this page 30 days in advance of their effective date. </p>
<p><b>What information we collect and how it is used</b><br>
  Access to the majority of content, services and features on startribune.com 
  requires users to become registered members. Member registration requires you 
  to provide certain Personally Identifiable Information, such as your name, e-mail 
  address, street address, gender, and date of birth. You will be asked to select 
  a member name and password so that you have access to this information and can 
  revise it in the future. To complete the registration process, we will send 
  you a validation e-mail message. You must click the link in the e-mail to fully 
  activate your membership account. You will also have the opportunity to subscribe 
  to e-mail newsletters and alerts and elect to receive e-mail Offers sent to 
  you on behalf of startribune.com advertisers. Some features and services may 
  require additional Personally Identifiable Information or other demographic 
  information. We may collect other personal information when you provide feedback, 
  comments, engage in chat, message boards, interactive forums or participate 
  in surveys, or if you contact us offline. For example, when you enter contests 
  you will be asked to also provide your phone number so that we can reach you 
  in the event you've won a prize. All users may decline to share such information 
  with us by choosing not to register on the Web site or use our services. Only 
  registered members, however, may access certain content, services and features. 
</p>
<p>You may also be asked to create a separate registration account with some of 
  the services provided by partners and other providers on startribune.com. Examples 
  include the Personals, the StribMail e-mail service, MyCast personalized weather 
  service, and Golden Gavel Auction events. Be aware that the information collected 
  by these providers may be subject to the privacy policy and terms of use of 
  that provider, and we recommend reviewing these prior to submitting your registration. 
</p>
<p>If you wish to forward an article to a friend, we will ask that you provide 
  your friend's name and e-mail address. While we collect statistics on which 
  articles are forwarded, we do not sell, rent, or market your friend's personal 
  information, and retain the information only as long as necessary to provide 
  this service.</p>
<p><b><br>
  Passive Data Collection and Use</b><br>
  Like most Web sites, startribune.com also collects and logs information automatically 
  and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to you, such 
  as your IP address, the name and location of your Internet Service Provider, 
  the type and version of your browser, the length of time that you stay on startribune.com, 
  search queries, your click-stream data, the location that referred you to startribune.com 
  and the average number of pages viewed. If you visit another Web site prior 
  to browsing startribune.com, that Web site might place personally identifiable 
  information within a URL, which may be logged by us. Your IP address is the 
  identifier assigned to your particular computer when you access the Internet. 
  Depending on how you connect to the Internet, your IP address may always be 
  the same, or it may change each time you access the Internet. Note that logging 
  your IP address does not in and of itself provide us with your name, e-mail 
  address or home or work address. We use this log information for systems administration 
  and troubleshooting purposes and may also use it to gather general demographic 
  information about you such as your general location and your Internet Service 
  Provider. In order to better provide our services to you and to develop member 
  profiles that enable us to focus our site, services and advertisements on your 
  interests, we may correlate this log information with other information about 
  you, such as your registration information or newspaper subscription records.</p>
<p><b>Use of Cookies</b><br>
  Most standard Web browsers contain a feature called "cookies," which 
  allow a Web site to place information about a user's visit to that Web site 
  in a small data text file that is stored on the user's computer. Our use of 
  cookie technology will likely be transparent to you and is used to recognize 
  you and hold information from one visit to the next in an effort to increase 
  your ease of use of startribune.com and to allow us to better understand how 
  people use our site through click-stream analysis. For example, cookies are 
  used to store your member name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter 
  that information each time you visit. Another example is that we may use cookie 
  technology to control the number of times you see a particular advertisement 
  while visiting startribune.com. You can turn the cookies feature off by using 
  your browser preference options, but doing so will severely limit your access 
  to startribune.com and may prevent you from registration. </p>
<p>Some of startribune.com's third party content providers also may place a cookie 
  on the user's computer. If a user chooses to monitor or restrict cookies that 
  are placed on his computer, the user can determine the Web site that is attempting 
  to place a cookie. Those cookies are controlled by the content provider, and 
  users should refer to that provider's privacy policy for further information 
  regarding its use of cookies.</p>
<p>We use software developed by another company, RealMedia, to display advertising 
  on startribune.com, and we may use cookies in conjunction with displaying those 
  ads. In addition, advertisers may elect to use other advertising companies to 
  serve their ads on startribune.com, and advertisers themselves may also place 
  a cookie on a user's computer. We do not have access to the cookies or their 
  contents that are placed by advertisers or by third-party advertising companies.</p>
<p><b>Use of Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
  Personally Identifiable Information may be accessed by the user who entered 
  it, by Star Tribune and startribune.com personnel, and by certain third parties, 
  such as those who provide technical support or content services to startribune.com. 
  We ask these third parties to keep any personal information supplied by us confidential. 
  We also endeavor to keep your Personally Identifiable Information inaccessible 
  to other users or advertisers of startribune.com. Note that your member name 
  will be displayed on our homepage when you visit startribune.com as a logged 
  in member. We will also display your e-mail address and contact information 
  in your Member Center. We make every effort to make the Member Center secure; 
  it can only be accessed by logging in with your member name and password. </p>
<p>We also reserve the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information when 
  deemed necessary or appropriate to comply with the law, respond to claims, protect 
  our computer systems and customers, ensure the integrity and operation of our 
  business and systems, or protect the rights, property or safety of startribune.com, 
  its affiliates, or others.</p>
<p>We will not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information without your 
  advance permission except as explained in this privacy policy or as explained 
  at the time the information was collected. </p>
<p><b>Use of Aggregated information</b><br>
  In order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and others, 
  we may use your Personally Identifiable Information to create a compiled, aggregate 
  view of the startribune.com audience and their usage patterns. We use Aggregated 
  Information to operate our services and to better understand our audience as 
  we develop new content and services. Aggregated Information may also be shared 
  with third parties we contract with to provide content and services on startribune.com 
  as well as advertisers so that they can better understand our audience. For 
  example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of our users are female 
  or within a certain age range or live within a cluster of zip codes. </p>
<p><b>Children's Privacy</b><br>
  Startribune.com is particularly concerned with providing a safe online environment 
  for children. Children under the age 13 will not be allowed to register and 
  become a member of startribune.com in order to access general startribune.com 
  content, features and services. </p>
<p>In the future, parents and legal guardians of children under age 13 who register 
  are able to establish a member account for their child by accessing the Member 
  Center. Other areas and services operated by startribune.com that do not require 
  registration but that ask for Personally Identifiable Information from children 
  under age 13 will require a parental consent before collecting the information. 
  Star Tribune does not ask children under age 13 for more personal information, 
  as a condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate 
  in a given activity or promotion. Further, we limit most of our contests to 
  people who are at least 18 years of age, making children ineligible to enter. 
  An example of an instance in which we sought parental consent to collect user 
  data from children was the Star Tribune Cranial Cram scholarship contest, in 
  which prizes were awarded to schoolchildren. In this instance, the information 
  was used only to award scholarships and prizes.</p>
<p>Parental consent to allow registration and collect information about children 
  can be provided by faxing or mailing a copy of the completed <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/776/39475.html">Parental 
  Consent Form</a>, including your signature, to the address or facsimile number 
  provided on the Parental Consent Form. This form will be available in applicable 
  areas of our site. </p>
<p>Startribune.com will not knowingly disclose personal information about users 
  under the age of 13 without prior parental or legal guardian consent, except 
  as required by law. If for any reason you wish to access, update or remove information 
  about your child that has been previously provided to startribune.com, you may 
  fax us (at 612-673-4840), call us at 612-288-2830 or use our e-mail <a href="http://www.startribune.com/feedback">Feedback 
  Form</a>.</p>
<p>Startribune.com strongly recommends parental supervision when a child uses 
  the Internet, particularly when a child enters a forum or uses e-mail. We also 
  encourage parents to instruct their children not to give out personal information 
  in these areas.</p>
<p><b>Member Mail and E-mail Offers</b><br>
  Startribune.com does not rent, sell, barter or give away its user or member 
  lists or its users' or members' names, e-mail addresses or mailing addresses 
  for use by advertisers and other third parties for the purpose of solicitations, 
  unless the user has previously given his or her consent at the time of general 
  registration or registration for a specific contest or service. If a user granted 
  permission to receive solicitations (referred to as e-mail Offers) at the time 
  of registration but subsequently wishes to opt out from receiving such solicitations, 
  the user may go to the Member Center and change one or more of the category-specific 
  permissions related to receiving e-mail sent on behalf of startribune.com advertisers. 
</p>
<p>All registered users will receive periodic Member Mail via e-mail related to 
  their membership account or various features and services on startribune.com 
  that their membership entitles them to access. Because Member Mail is an important 
  part of our service to you, users cannot opt-out of receiving Member Mail.</p>
<p>Separate from startribune.com Member Mail, Star Tribune FYI provides information 
  and opportunities related to the newspaper. If you don't want to receive this 
  information, you can opt out by changing your permission setting for Star Tribune 
  FYI e-mail in the Member Center. </p>
<p>When a user specifically authorizes e-mail solicitations (for example, in the 
  user license for our Jobs service) we make available the user names and other 
  Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with the applicable license. 
  Please refer to the legal notices and license terms of our Jobs service for 
  further details.<br>

<p>Our HTML-encoded e-mail messages include graphic files, which we use to gather 
  information about e-mails sent our members. When such a message is opened in 
  an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient's computer accesses our server 
  to retrieve the graphic file, and allows us to record and store the date and 
  time, the recipient's e-mail address, and other standard logging information. 
  These HTML-encoded e-mail messages may also read cookies. </p>
<p><b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b><br>
  Startribune.com expects its partners, providers of content and services and 
  advertisers to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third 
  parties, including our partners, providers of content and services, advertisers 
  and others accessible through our site may have their own privacy and data collection 
  policies and practices. For example, during your visit to startribune.com you 
  may link to, or view as part of a frame on a startribune.com page, certain content 
  that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also through startribune.com 
  you may be introduced to, or be able to access information, services, Web sites, 
  features, contest or sweepstakes offered by other parties, such as the StribMail 
  e-mail service (currently provided by CommTouch). Star Tribune and startribune.com 
  is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should 
  check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing 
  information on a feature or page operated by a third party. </p>
<p><b>Electronic commerce with the Star Tribune</b><br>
  For certain electronic commerce services on startribune.com, such as placing 
  classified ads electronically, subscribing to the Star Tribune newspaper or 
  to our premium online services or ordering Star Tribune merchandise, we require 
  additional information. To complete these transactions, we may collect information 
  from you such as your name, credit card number and other financial or Personally 
  Identifiable Information. We endeavor to protect the security of your payment 
  information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, 
  which encrypts information you submit. The Star Tribune uses the credit card 
  and shipping information for the purpose of completing the transaction and does 
  not provide this information to third parties except for the issuers of credit 
  cards in order to process the transaction, or as otherwise set forth in this 
  policy. </p>
<p><b>Electronic commerce with other merchants</b><br>
  Startribune.com provides Internet hosting services to a number of online merchants 
  that sell a variety of goods and services. These stores may collect information 
  from you such as your name, credit card number and other contact information. 
  Startribune.com does not collect, use or disclose this information, nor does 
  it own or control the stores or have responsibility for transactions made by 
  those merchants. If you would like to know more about the information collected 
  when you participate in electronic commerce on or through startribune.com, you 
  should check directly with those online merchants, as their privacy policies 
  govern the usage of those merchants' online stores. </p>
<p><b>Changing your personal information</b><br>
  In general, a registered member may return to his or her account information 
  page in the Member Center to update the information he or she previously provided 
  to us. To prevent minors from improperly entering contests for which they are 
  not eligible, we may require additional proof from people asking to change their 
  birth date information. Information you provide to startribune.com may be stored 
  by us for an indefinite time. This information includes the registration data 
  as well as information provided in conjunction with various membership services, 
  contests or features available on startribune.com </p>
<p>You can delete your startribune.com membership account in Member Center by 
  clicking on the link labeled "delete my account." By doing so, all 
  but a transactional record of your membership account will be removed from our 
  databases, though some records may remain on back-up media. Note that by deleting 
  your account, you will cancel your membership and no longer be able to access 
  startribune.com.</p>
<p>If after visiting your Member Center you are unclear on how to change your 
  information or have other questions, please contact us via e-mail using our 
  <a href="http://www.startribune.com/feedback">Feedback Form</a> or by phone 
  at 612-288-2830.</p>
<p><b>Remember the risks when you use the Internet</b><br>
  You should know that when you voluntarily disclose personal information on the 
  startribune.com Web site (for example, in the Talk discussion forums), that 
  information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited 
  messages from other people. While we do our best to protect your personal information, 
  we cannot be responsible for information that you choose to publicly disclose. 
  Further, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any passwords 
  or other account information. Although we make good faith efforts to store the 
  information we collect in a secure operating environment that is not available 
  to the public and to work with responsible third parties, we cannot guarantee 
  complete security for your information. </p>
<p>In addition, our advertisers, content providers, partners and other Internet 
  sites or services that may be accessible through startribune.com have separate 
  data and privacy practices that are independent of us, and we disclaim any responsibility 
  or liability for their policies or actions. Please contact those sites directly 
  if you have questions about their privacy policies.</p>
<p><b>International users</b><br>
  If you are an international user, by using startribune.com or by registering 
  for any of its services, you agree that startribune.com may collect, use and 
  transfer your personal information as described in this privacy policy, including 
  transfers outside the country where you live. If you reside in a country in 
  the European Union or other jurisdiction that provides access rights under law, 
  you may access your personal information or have it corrected or updated by 
  going to your account information page and personally updating the information. 
  in accordance with applicable law by contacting us. In some jurisdictions, you 
  may be charged a reasonable fee for access to information.</p>
<p><b>Platform for Privacy Preferences.</b><br>
  Startribune.com supports P3P, the Platform for Privacy Preferences, which allows 
  us to convey our privacy policies, to the extent possible, in standardized, 
  machine-readable code. While our site supports P3P, the resulting code has inherent 
  limitations such that it does not fully and may not accurately express all of
