<h2>The Types of Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>Aggregate Information</h3>

<p>Our web server automatically collects the IP address, but not the email address, of all visitors to our Site. We also track the pages within our Site viewed by each visitor. Such information is aggregated with tracking data from all Site visitors. We use this aggregate information to help us evaluate visitor traffic patterns and improve our Site by making it more responsive to the needs of visitors. This information does not identify you personally.</p>

<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

<p>We only collect personally identifiable information such as your name, address, telephone number, email address and credit card information when you choose to provide it on our Site. For example, we collect such information from you whenever you place a Stage Gift Card order, sign up to receive email notification of upcoming sales and events (sales alerts), participate in a survey, provide customer feedback, or visit the Credit Card portion of our Site to apply online or access your account.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>Cookies are pieces of data stored on a visitor's computer by a web site through a web browser, and are typically used to obtain information about the visitor, including, for example, what web pages are viewed during a visit. We do not use cookies on this Site.</p>

<h2>How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>

      <p>We use aggregate information to help us evaluate visitor traffic patterns and improve our Site by making it more responsive to the needs of visitors.</p>

      <p>The personally identifiable information we collect is used to process requests or orders you make on our Site. For example, we use information you provide to help you purchase Stage Gift Cards, provide you with sales alerts, participate in surveys, and help us respond to your customer service comments and inquiries. We also use personally identifiable information we collect to contact you regarding our products and services that may be of interest to you. Visitors who do not wish to receive sales alerts and other promotional notifications may take advantage of the opt-out procedures described in detail below.</p>

<h2>How We Share Information We Collect</h2>

      <p>We do not share your personal information with other businesses or organizations for commercial purposes. We may disclose your information to companies that provide support services to us such as shippers when necessary to fulfill an order you have placed, printers or mailing houses that help us market our products or services, or web hosts or designers who help us create and maintain this Site. We may also disclose your personal information when required by law, when such action is necessary to comply with a court order or legal process served on us. In the event Specialty Retailers, Inc. enters into a business transaction such as a merger, sale of assets, or acquisition by another company, personal information about visitors to our Site may be transferred as part of our business assets.</p>

<h2>Choice/Opt-out</h2>

      <p>Visitors to our Site may be given the opportunity to choose whether to have their information used for certain purposes at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our Stage Gift Card order form allows the visitor to choose whether to receive email notifications of upcoming sales and events. Visitors who no longer wish to receive our promotional email notifications may always opt-out of receiving these notifications by using the clickable "unsubscribe" link contained in the message.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

      <p>We are sensitive to the need to protect the privacy of children who use the Internet. We therefore do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13). If we become aware that a child under the age of thirteen (13) has provided personally identifiable information to us through our Site, we will delete it from our files. If you are under the age of thirteen (13), please not attempt to provide any personally identifiable information on our Site.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

      <p>We understand that visitors to our Site are concerned about the security of the information they provide over the Internet. We therefore use industry-standard technologies, including Secure Sockets Layering (SSL), to protect the information that you provide through our Site. SSL is a security protocol that encrypts information entered on our Site before it is sent over the Internet. When we collect personal information in connection with the sale of Stage Gift Cards, we redirect visitors to a secure server where the information will be stored. We also employ security measures to protect your information offline, including the use of password-protected databases to store email addresses and other personal information you provide. If you choose to use the Credit Card portion of this Site to either apply online or access your credit account, you will enter a web site operated by WFNNB. For information regarding the security of the WFNNB web site, please review the WFNNB Security Statement .</p>
