<p>Thank you for visiting Maryland Electronic Capital.&nbsp; We take data
security and the privacy of your personal information very seriously.&nbsp;
Maryland law mandates that State agencies shall not create personal records
unless the need for the information is clearly established and that personal
records shall be relevant to the purposes for which they are collected,
be accurate and current, and not be obtained by fraudulent means. State
officials who request personal data from citizens must notify the citizens
regarding the purposes for which the information is collected; consequences
to the citizen for refusing to provide the personal information; and, the
citizen’s right to inspect and correct personal records. In addition, citizens
must be notified as to whether the information is generally available for
public inspection; and whether the information is made available to other
entities. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.techmd.state.md.us">eMaryland
