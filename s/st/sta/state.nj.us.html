        Page</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We at the 
        State of New Jersey are especially concerned about protecting children's 
        privacy. We hope parents and teachers are involved in children's Internet 
        explorations. It is particularly important for parents to guide their 
        children when children are asked to provide personal information on line. 
        The State of New Jersey homepage for kids encourages children to send 
        email messages with their feedback and suggestions. We specifically ask 
        children to get their parents' permission before providing any information 
        on line -- at our site or any other site -- and hope parents will always 
        be involved in those decisions. Most importantly, when children do provide 
        information through the State of New Jersey web site, it is only used 
        to enable us to respond to the writer, and not to create profiles of children</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Section 
        C. Public Access to Information</b> <br>
        In the State of New Jersey, laws exist to ensure that government is open 
        and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information 
        possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions 
        to the public's right to access public records that serve various needs 
        including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are provided by both 
        state and federal laws.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">All the 
        information collected at this site becomes public records that may be 
        subject to inspection and copying by members of the public, unless an 
        exemption in law exists.</font></p>
