<p><strong>We combine information.</strong> We may combine information that we collect offline with information we collect through the Sites and Mobile Apps, including Starry.com, or other Starry products and services.

<h4 id="we-use-the-information-we-collect-to-improve-our-products-to-provide-services-and-for-marketing-purposes-">We use the information we collect to improve our products, to provide services, and for marketing purposes.</h4>
<p><strong>We use information to evaluate and improve our Sites and Mobile Apps, products, and other services.</strong> We may use your information to make our Sites and Mobile Apps, products, and other services better, as well as to develop new products and services. Some of our Sites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.

<p><strong>We use information to market our products and services to you.</strong> We may, from time-to-time, use information we have collected to market our own, or our affiliates’, products and services to you. For example, if you sign up for our Service waitlist, we may contact you to keep you updated on the availability of our Service. We may also provide you with information about new products, special offers, new features, or updates. We may also use your information to serve you ads about products and offers.

<p><strong>You can opt-out of some online behavioral advertising.</strong> In addition to our use of information you make available to us when you interact with our Sites for marketing and advertising, we also provide non-personally identifiable information to third-party advertisers to serve advertisements on other websites about goods and services, including for unaffiliated products and services.

<p><strong>Some browsers have “Do Not Track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you.</strong> Because a universal "Do Not Track" protocol has not yet been finalized, our Sites’ information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that it provides to consumers, will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Notice, whether or not a “Do Not Track” signal is received.</p>
<p><strong>You can opt-out of receiving our marketing emails.</strong> To stop receiving our promotional emails, follow the instructions in any promotional message you receive from us. Even if you opt-out of getting our marketing messages, we will still send you transactional messages. These include responses to your questions information about any services or products to which you subscribe or purchase from us.</p>

<h4 id="we-strive-to-protect-the-information-we-collect-">We strive to protect the information we collect.</h4>
<p>We use a combination of technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized access to, use of, or disclosure of the personal information we collect and store. No security program is 100 percent secure, however. As a result, we cannot guarantee that we will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose personal information.</p>
<h4 id="we-may-link-to-third-party-sites-or-services-we-do-not-control-">We may link to third-party sites or services we do not control.</h4>
<p>If you click on a link to a third-party site, you will be taken to a website we do not control. This Privacy Notice does not apply to the privacy practices of that website. Read the privacy policy of other websites carefully. We are not responsible for the content or privacy policies of these third-party sites.
Additionally, we may include applications from third parties on our Sites or through our Mobile Apps, which allow interaction or content sharing by users. Some of these applications provide specific services or content from a third party, such as a Facebook "Share" or "Like" button, and are visible to you when you visit our Sites. Your interaction with these programs typically allows the third party to collect some information about you through cookies they place on your device and other tracking mechanisms. In some cases, the third party may recognize you through its cookies even when you do not interact with their application. Please review the third parties' respective privacy policies to better understand their data collection practices and controls they make available to you.</p>
