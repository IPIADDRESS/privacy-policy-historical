This cookie helps prevent that. The cookie expires at the end of the session and should be removed by the browser.

The cookies can be valid for different time periods, depending on the limits of individual advertising campaigns, but are generally valid for between 30 days and 1 year. The cookies are removed when the campaigns to which they are attached are completed.

Generally, this prevents buyers from showing the same video too many times to a single user across multiple websites. In order to match a buyer’s identifier to our system a synchronization process will set a cookie (beginning uid-bp-) which contains a user/browser identifier from the buying partner. This identifier can then be used in the advertising process. The cookies are valid for 1 year. These cookies may be deleted but will be re-set when the buyer is encountered again. The cookie contains an identifier set by the buyer’s system. Details of the cookies from our buying partners can be found on their websites. This data may be used by buying partners to target advertisements. We have no access to this data.</td>

The data contained is controlled by the marketplace &amp; data management platform who will be able to provide more details about the type of data referenced.

				      <p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights.</strong> California residents have the right to request and obtain a list of the third parties, if any, to which personal information (as defined by California law) has been disclosed for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately prior calendar year (e.g. requests made in 2018 will receive information about 2017 sharing activities, if any). California residents also have the right to opt out of having their personal information shared for direct marketing purposes. You may do so by sending an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:legalnotices@freewheel.tv">legalnotices@freewheel.tv</a>, using this Policy as the subject line, and include your full name, e-mail address, phone number and postal address in your message, or you may contact us at the postal address below, including the same information.</p>
<p>On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) will provide California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes and explains how California residents can exercise those rights.</p>
<p><em>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</em></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
<li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
<li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>
<li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
<li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.</li>
<li>Our business or commercial purpose for selling or disclosing that personal information, if applicable.</li>
<li>If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:</li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li style="margin-left:2em">sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and</li>
<li style="margin-left:2em">disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><em>Deletion Request Rights</em></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we delete personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. We will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records upon receiving your verifiable consumer request, unless an exception applies.</p>
<p><em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</em></p>
<p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a request to us by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling us at (888) 930-6228</li>
<p></p>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">or</li>
<p></p>
<li>Sending an email to: <a href="mailto:FW_California_Consumers_CCPA_Data_Requests@freewheel.com">FW_California_Consumers_CCPA_Data_Requests@freewheel.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p><!-- br--></p>
<p>You are not required to create an account with us in order to make a request.&nbsp; Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf may make a request related to your personal information. You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
<p>We are not required to provide personal information to you more than twice within a 12-month period.</p>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with your personal information if we cannot reasonably verify your identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<p>We will only use personal information provided in a request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<p><em>Notice of California Consumer Data Collection and Sharing Practices </em></p>
<p>The following is a description of our data collection practices, including the personal information we collect, the sources of that information, the purposes for which we collect information, and whether we sell or disclose that information to external parties.&nbsp; We may use any and all of the information for any of the purposes described in the privacy policy, unless limitations are listed.&nbsp; The categories we use to describe the information are those enumerated in the CCPA.</p>
<p>For Consumers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Identifiers: </strong>We collect IP addresses and unique identifiers (such as account identifiers, cookie identifiers, and device IDs).</li>
<li><strong>Commercial Information: </strong>We collect purchasing tendencies or histories from third parties and connect that data to the categories of personal information listed here.</li>
<li><strong>Internet or Other Electronic Network Activity Information: </strong>We collect information about your internet service provider, as well as information regarding your interactions with websites and advertisements.</li>
<li><strong>Geolocation Data: </strong>We collect geolocation data.</li>
<li><strong>Inferences drawn to create a profile about a consumer reflecting the consumer’s preferences or characteristics: </strong>We analyze your actual or likely preferences through a series of computer algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- br--></p>
<p>For individuals who provide data directly to Freewheel:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Identifiers: </strong></li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li style="margin-left:2em">We may collect your name, employer, job title, telephone number, email address, and postal address. If you create an account, you will be asked to create a username and password to access our Services.</li>
<li style="margin-left:2em">We collect IP address and unique identifiers (such as account identifiers, cookie identifiers, and device IDs)</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Internet or Other Electronic Network Activity Information. </strong>We may collect information about your internet service provider, as well as information regarding your interaction with websites and advertisements.</li>
<li><strong>Geolocation Data: </strong>We may collect geolocation data.</li>
<li><strong>Professional or employment-related information: </strong>We may collect your job title and employment information.</li>
<li><strong>Education Information: </strong>We may collect academic information from you.</li>
<li><strong>Inferences drawn to create a profile about a consumer reflecting the consumer’s preferences or characteristics: </strong>We analyze your actual or likely preferences through a series of computer algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- br--></p>
<p>We share the above-listed information with service providers, which are external parties that we engage for business purposes and are restricted from using personal information for any purpose that is not related to our engagement. The categories of service providers with whom we share information and the service they provide are described in the privacy policy.</p>
<p>Freewheel’s services may use cookie-based frequency capping, including when it is acting in its capacity as a service provider.</p>
<p>On certain occasions, we sell information to third parties. An external party may be considered a third party either because the purpose of sharing is not an enumerated business purpose under California law, or because our contract does not restrict them from using personal information for other purposes. To “sell” information means to disclose it to an external party for monetary or other benefit. We sell the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> We provide unique personal identifiers, online identifiers, internet protocol address, or other similar identifiers to our advertising partners.</li>
<li><strong>Internet or other Electronic Network Activity Information:</strong> We provide information regarding your interaction with an internet website, application, or advertisement with our affiliates, advertising partners, data analytics providers, and audience measurement companies.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- br--></p>
<p>We may also disclose information to other external parties who are not listed here when required by law or to protect FreeWheel or other persons, as described in our privacy policy.</p>

Although end users have a right to access their personal data collected by our customers, we have no direct business relationship with the end users of our customers. If you are a customer of one of our customer and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our Service, please direct your requests to our customer that you interact with directly. We will transfer personal data to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.</p>
<p>An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the FreeWheel’s customer (the data controller). If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>We also have no control over the content of the advertisement, including any cookies and web beacons set by advertisers on our customers’ Sites. Each customer understands that in the course of providing Services to it, we collect or receive information from the web browsers of individuals that are either visiting such customer’s web property or viewing content that is owned or displayed by such customer. This information includes frequency of ads delivered and other delivery statistics, time, browser type and version, visitor’s operating system, device type, referral URL, visitors’ IP addresses, visitors’ countries inferred from their IP addresses, and cookie data, including user IDs. We require our customers to obtain consent for our use of such information and we use it for our provision of Services and enforcement of our rights as described in the applicable customer contract, to improve our Services, and to compile aggregated statistics for internal or marketing purposes.</p>
<p>We do not possess or have access to information that could match IP addresses or user IDs to the identity of individuals. We do not allow visitor information collected and stored for one customer to be accessed by any other customer. Further, we may use and retain such information only as provided in its agreement with our customer. We require each of our customers to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations that are applicable to their use of our Services, and we promise each customer that we will do the same with respect to our provision of Services. We ask each customer to post a privacy policy that covers our Services and to maintain all necessary rights to allow us to provide the Services, including without limitation to receive the information that we collect and store on such customer’s behalf. We also require each customer to prevent personal data to be sent to us (other than IP addresses, device IDs and user IDs). An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to our applicable customer (the data controller) which has transferred such data to us for processing.
