    <strong>1. Introduction </strong> <br>
    <br>
    <strong>1.1 Purpose of Policy </strong> <br>
    <br>  
  Stickam Worldwide, Inc. ("Stickam Worldwide," "us" or "we") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its members, visitors, and other users (collectively, "members," "you" or “users”) of its Services.   We have established this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect Personal Information and how we disclose that Personal Information as defined below.  This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Service. Both the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service govern your use of the Services.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>1.2 About the Service</strong> <br>
  <br>
  This Privacy Policy applies to all products, services and software provided by Stickam [www.stickam.com], PayPerLive [www.payperlive.com], and StreamAPI [streamapi.com] (the “Services”).  In its operation of the Services, we collect, use and retain all information, including Personal Information and Non-Personal Information (defined below) that you disclose in your registration to, and use of the Services.  
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>1.3 Notice Concerning Children </strong> <br>
  <br>
  <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> PLEASE NOTE: The Services and any products or services provided therein are limited to audiences fourteen (14) years old or older. We do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from anyone under the age of 13, nor do we direct any content specifically at children under the age of 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is underage, we will promptly delete any Personal Information in that user’s account(s). 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>2. Information Collection Practices </strong> <br>
  <br>
  <strong>2.1 Types of Information Collected </strong> <br>
  <br>
  We collect the following types of information about users:<br>
  <br>
  (a) Non-Personal Information. When you use the Services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs automatically track and collect the following categories of information when you visit our websites: 1. IP Addresses; 2. domain servers; 3. types of computers accessing the website; and 4. types of web browsers used to access the website (collectively "Traffic Data"). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for marketing purposes or for improving your experience with our Services. We also use "cookies" (defined in Section 2.3 below) in order to customize content specific to your interests, to ensure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the site, and to restrict the access of users who have violated our Terms of Service.  Additionally our advertisers may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about people who view or interact with their advertisements on our site. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and judge their effectiveness. We do not provide any personal information about you to these third party advertisers.
  <br>
  <br>
  (b) Personal Information. In order for you to access certain services, you are required to provide certain information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes the following categories of information: 1. Contact Data (such as your name, and e-mail address); 2. Demographic Data (such as your gender, age, occupation, location, and marital status); and 3. Profile Data (such as your user name(s), interests, and content uploaded by you, such as photographs, video and audio files, which contain your personal information and likeness).  Additionally, if you communicate with us by e-mail, use any of the communication tools such as instant messaging, and video chat, or post messages to any chat groups, bulletin boards, or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys, or contest entries, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information.   We also may receive information about you from third parties (such as address information, purchase history and additional demographic information).
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>2.2 Use and Sharing of Information </strong> <br>
  <br>
  (a) Our Use of Personal Information. We use your Personal Information internally in order to promote and operate the Services and to introduce users to new features, areas or content. For example, we may use your Demographic and Profile Data to customize and tailor your experience by displaying advertisements and content that we think you might be interested in, and according to your preferences. In addition, we may use Contact Data to send you information about our Company or our products or services, or family-friendly promotional material from some of our partners and affiliates, or to contact you when necessary. 
  <br>
  <br>
  (b) Sharing of Non-Personal Information with Third Parties. We may share aggregate Traffic Data with third parties who assist us in understanding the needs of our users, and to continually improve the Services for them. We share Demographic Data with advertisers and other third parties only on an aggregate (i.e., non-personally-identifiable) basis. 
  <br>
  <br>
  (c) Sharing of Personal Information with Third Parties. Our PayPerLive service provides users the ability to create their own social network communities.  When you register to become a member of a user’s social network community, you are providing Personal Information to us as well as to the user who created that community.  Some social network communities allow you to sign up with your Stickam user name and password.  If you use your Stickam user name and password to register with a social network community created by a user, the Personal Information and Non-Personal Information associated with your Stickam account will be provided to the user who created that social network community.  We also share Contact Data with users with whom you have transacted business with (for example, when you purchase tickets to live events or subscriptions to premium content provided by Stickam users).  Contact Data is shared with our contractors who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, data storage and security) related to our operation of the Services. Those contractors have all agreed to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Contact Data and other Personal Information as necessary to carry out their specific contractual obligations to us. 
  <br>
  <br>
  (d) Display of Personal Information. Any Personal Information (including live-streaming video content) that you post or otherwise disclose on or through the Services (for example, on message boards or chat rooms, streamed live via your media player, or within your personal profile page) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your account name and other profile information (but not your email address) is displayed to other internet users when you submit content or send messages on or through the Services, and you can be contacted by other users who wish to send you comments. Any content that you submit on or through the Services (including any Personal Information contained therein) may be distributed through the internet and other media. Additionally, certain Personal Information from your Stickam profile will be pre-populated into your profile for social networking communities you join using your Stickam user name and password.  <br>
  <br>
  (e) Social Login. If you use Social Login to enter a chat session on Stickam, we will obtain and may collect Personal Information (such as your "real" name, email address, profile picture, names of friends, and other information you make publicly available) which you have provided to the third party social networking service (“SNS”) whose login credentials you are using, in accordance with the privacy settings you have set in your account with the applicable third party SNS.    In order to determine what information may be shared with and collected by Stickam, you should review the privacy policy and other disclosures provided by the third party SNS whose login credentials you use to enter the chat session.  You can prevent the collection of information you have provided to a third party SNS by creating and using a Stickam account to login and enter a chat session instead of using Social Login.  
  <br>
  <br>
  (f) Social Connect.  If you use Social Connect to log into your Stickam account, we will obtain and may collect Personal Information (such as your "real" name, email address, profile picture, names of friends, and other information you make publicly available) which you have provided to the third party social networking service (“SNS”) whose login credentials you are using, in accordance with the privacy settings you have set in your account with the applicable third party SNS.  In order to determine what information may be shared with and collected by Stickam, you should review the privacy policy and other disclosures provided by the third party SNS whose credentials you use to log into your Stickam account. Additionally, if you use Social Connect to login to Stickam, we may share your Traffic Data and Personal Information with the applicable third party SNS whose Credentials you used to login.  You can control the collection and sharing of information you have provided to a third party SNS using the “user settings” or “privacy settings” associated with the applicable third party SNS.  You can prevent the sharing of your information by Stickam with a third party SNS by logging in to your Stickam account, clicking on Social Connect in your profile page, and disconnecting the applicable third party SNS.  
  <br>
  <br>
  (g) E-mail Invitations. Some of the Services allow users to invite friends to join a service or a social networking community by sending invitations via an automated invitation system.

  <strong>2.3 Use of Cookies. </strong> <br>
  <br>
  When you visit one of our websites, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of our Services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We also employ Local Shared Objects, commonly known as Flash cookies, in certain situations where we use Flash to provide content such as live-streaming video and recorded video clips.  Flash cookies are used to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. You may access your Adobe Flash management tools directly from the Global Storage Settings panel of the online Settings Manager at Adobe’s web site located here: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/</a>.  
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to our use of cookies, our advertisers may set and access cookies to collect information about people who view or interact with their advertisements on our site. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and judge their effectiveness.  The use of cookies by these companies is subject to their own privacy policies.   <br>
