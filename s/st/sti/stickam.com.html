<p><strong>1. Introduction </strong></p>
<p><strong>1.1 Purpose of Policy </strong></p>
<p>Advanced Video Communications ("AVC," "us" or "we") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its members, visitors, and other users (collectively, "members," "you" or "users) of the <u><a href="/" target="_top">www.stickam.com</a></u> website ("Website"). This Website Privacy Policy is provided to help you make an informed decision whether to continue to visit and use the Website, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This policy is only applicable to this Website, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the site, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Stickam Terms of Use.&nbsp; Both the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use govern your interaction with the Website, and your registration for and use of the Website.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 About the Service</strong></p>
<p>Stickam™ is a web-based interactive multimedia communications service that allows members to interact and communicate with the Stickam community over the Internet by sharing their own media content and personal information.&nbsp; To accomplish this, each Stickam member creates his or her own profile, which contains Personal Information (defined further in Section 2.2(b) below) that the member chooses to include. Such Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, the member’s name, age, occupation, location, marital status, and other similar personal information; it may also include shared content uploaded by the member to Stickam, such as photographs, video and audio files, which may contain the member’s Personal Information and likeness. </p>
<p><strong>1.3 Notice Concerning Children </strong></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> This Website and any products or services provided therein are limited to audiences fourteen (14) years old or older. The Website does not direct any content specifically at children. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is underage, we will promptly delete any Personal Information in that user’s account. </p>
<p><strong>2. Information Collection Practices </strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1 Types of Information Collected </strong></p>
<p>AVC collects the following types of information about users:</p>
<p>(a) Non-Personal Information. When you use Stickam, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs automatically track and collect the following categories of information when you visit our Website: 1. IP Addresses; 2. domain servers; 3. types of computers accessing the Website; and 4. types of web browsers used to access the Website (collectively "Traffic Data"). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for marketing purposes or for improving your experience on the Website. We also use "cookies" (defined in Section 2.2(g) below) in order to customize content specific to your interests, to ensure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, and to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the site.</p>
<p>(b) Personal Information. In order for you to access certain services that we offer via the Website (including registration for a profile, and the use of chat rooms and message boards), we require you to provide us with certain information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information").&nbsp; Personal Information includes the following categories of information: 1. Contact Data (such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address); 2. Demographic Data (such as your gender, age, occupation, location, and marital status); 3. Profile Data (such as your Member name, interests, and content uploaded by you to Stickam, such as photographs, video and audio files, which may also contain your personal information and likeness). If you communicate with us by e-mail, use any of the Stickam communication tools such as instant messaging, and video chat, or post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards, or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys, or contest entries, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information. </p>
<p><strong>2.2 Use and Sharing of Information </strong></p>
<p>(a) AVC Use of Information. AVC uses your Personal Information internally in order to promote and operate the Website, and to introduce users to new features, areas or content of the Website.&nbsp; For example, we use your Demographic and Profile Data to customize and tailor your experience on the Website and/or services, displaying content that we think you might be interested in and according to your preferences.&nbsp; In addition, we use Contact Data to send you information about our Company or our products or services, or promotional material from some of our partners, affiliates, or to contact you when necessary.&nbsp; </p>
<p>(b) Sharing of Non-Personal Information with Third Parties.&nbsp; We may share aggregate Traffic Data with third parties who assist us in understanding the needs of our Members and users, and to continually improve our Website for them. We share Demographic Data with advertisers and other third parties only on an aggregate (<em>i.e.</em>, non-personally-identifiable) basis. </p>
<p>(c) Sharing of Personal Information with Third Parties.&nbsp; We share Contact Data with our affiliate companies who may want to send you information about their products or services We also share Contact Data with our contractors who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, data storage and security) related to our operation of the Website. Those contractors have all agreed to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Contact Data and other Personal Information as necessary to carry out their specific contractual obligations to AVC<br>
(d) Display of Personal Information. Any Personal Information (including video content) that you disclose on the Website (for example, on message boards or chat rooms, or within your personal profile page) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your account name and other profile information (but not your email address) is displayed to other internet users when you upload videos or send messages through the Website, and you can be contacted by other users who send you comments. Any videos or other content that you submit to the Website (including any Personal Information contained therein) may be distributed through the internet and other media. &nbsp;</p>
<p>(e) E-mail Invitations.&nbsp; Members can invite friends to join Stickam by sending invitations via our automated invitation system. The Website stores the email addresses that Members provide so that the respondents may be added to the friend’s list of the member sending the invitations. Recipients of invitations from the Website may contact AVC to request the removal of their information from our database. </p>
<p>(f) Other Uses of Data. We may provide Traffic Data and Personal Information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, and we reserve the right to cooperate with law enforcement investigations by providing Traffic Data and Personal Information to law enforcement officials without requiring a subpoena or court order in certain situations (for example, in case of physical threats to our members).</p>

<p>When you visit the Stickam website, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.&nbsp;&nbsp; We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp; A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions.&nbsp;&nbsp; A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Stickam website may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. </p>
<p><strong>2.4 User Choice Regarding Collection, Use, and Distribution of Personal Information. </strong></p>
<p>You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. In such an event, you will not be able to complete our Membership registration, or access and use those portions of the Website that require your Personal Information. If you do not wish to receive information and promotional material from us or from our affiliate companies, you may select the appropriate "opt-out" option. </p>

Your Personal Information is stored on secure servers, and AVC takes reasonable measures to protect such&nbsp; information from disclosure to or access by third parties. Please note that AVC does not guarantee the security of member account information or Personal Information, and there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of your information over the internet will be intercepted. </p>
