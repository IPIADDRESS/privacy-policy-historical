By signing up, accessing, and/or using the Platform, each Subscriber is agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying&nbsp;<a href="/terms">Master Terms and Conditions</a> (“MTC”)</p>

<p>Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Use (when such term concerns Visitors), or the MTC (when such term concerns Subscribers).</p>

<p>In the course of operating the Site and the Platform and/or interacting with you, Stitch will collect (and/or receive) the following types of information. You authorize us to collect and/or receive such information and assume contractual responsibility for obtaining all consents as required under applicable laws and regulations.</p>

<h4 id="contact-information">1. Contact Information</h4>
<p>When you contact us through the “Contact Us” page, or sign up to become a Subscriber, you will be asked to provide certain information which may include first name, last name, e-mail address, job title, name of your organization, country, state/region and phone numbers (fax, cell and/or landline) (“Contact Information”).

<p><strong>From Your Activity.</strong>&nbsp;In an ongoing effort to improve the Site and the Platform, we automatically collect certain information when Visitors visit the Site and when Subscribers use the Platform. This information consists of IP addresses, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of the Site Visitors visit, and similar information concerning your use of the Site and the Platform (“Activity Information”).</p>

If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer or mobile device. Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to delete persistent cookies.

Any data collected by such third party remarketing service providers will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of such third party remarketing services provider. For more information on such third party remarketing service providers, including how to opt out from certain data collection, please visit the following links:

<h4 id="onward-transfer-to-third-parties">Onward Transfer to Third Parties</h4>

<p>Like many businesses, we hire other companies to perform certain business-related services. We may disclose personal information to certain types of third party companies but only to the extent needed to enable them to provide such services. The types of companies that may receive personal information and their functions are: hosting services; database management/back-up services; and payment processors. All such third parties function as our agents, performing services at our instruction and on our behalf pursuant to contracts which require they provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this Privacy Policy and implemented by Stitch.  You may opt out of having your personal information transferred to any or all of our categories of agents by emailing the instructions to privacy@stitchdata.com. Please allow us a reasonable time to process your request.</p>

<h4 id="opt-in-to-certain-onward-transfers">Opt-In to Certain Onward Transfers</h4>

<p>We will not transfer your personal information to a third party acting as a controller without first providing you with information regarding the identity of such controller or the nature of  such controller’s business, and obtaining your opt-in consent.<br>
We will not disclose your sensitive personal information to any third party without first obtaining your opt-in consent. You may grant such consent by contacting us at privacy@stitchdata.com.
In each instance, please allow us a reasonable time to process your response.</p>

<h4 id="business-transfer">Business Transfer</h4>

<p>In the event of a merger, dissolution or similar corporate event, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, we expect that the information that we have collected, including personal information, would be transferred to the surviving entity in a merger or the acquiring entity. All such transfers shall be subject to our commitments with respect to the privacy and confidentiality of such personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h4 id="disclosures-to-public-authorities">Disclosures to Public Authorities</h4>

<p>We are required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including for the purpose of meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose personal information to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities or required by law or regulation including, but not limited to, in response to court orders and subpoenas.</p>

<p>Stitch takes reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in processing and the nature of such data, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. You should keep in mind, however, that no internet transmission is 100% secure or error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Site and/or the Platform may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail or other electronic means. Where Stitch has given you a username and/or password which enables you to access certain parts of the Stitch Site, you are responsible for keeping such username and/or password confidential.</p>

<h4 id="links-to-third-party-sites">Links to Third Party Sites</h4>

<p>The Site may, from time to time, contain links to external websites. Stitch encourages you to review the privacy and security policies of any externally linked websites that may be accessed through the Site. Stitch assumes no responsibility or liability for the information, collection and disclosure practices of any external websites that a user can access through the Site. Please check the privacy policies of these external websites before you submit any Personally Identifiable Information or other information to them.</p>

<h4 id="access-to-personal-information">Access to Personal Information</h4>

<p>We acknowledge the individual’s right to access their personal data.  Upon request to privacy@stitchdata.com, we will provide you with confirmation as to whether we are processing your personal information, and have the data communicated to you within a reasonable time. You have the right to access, correct, amend or delete your personal information where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of this Privacy Policy. We may require payment of a non-excessive fee to defray our expenses in this regard. Please allow us a reasonable time to respond to your inquiries and requests.</p>

<h4 id="retention-of-personal-information">Retention of Personal Information</h4>

<p>We will retain your personal information in a form that identifies you only for as long as it serves the purpose(s) for which it was initially collected as stated in this Privacy Policy, or subsequently authorized. We may continue processing your personal information for longer periods, but only for the time and to the extent such processing reasonably serves the purposes of archiving in the public interest, journalism, literature and art, scientific or historical research and statistical analysis, and subject to the protection of this Privacy Policy. After such time periods have expired, we may either delete your personal information or retain it in a form such that it does not identify you personally.</p>

<h4 id="important-notice-to-all-non-us-residents">Important Notice to All Non-U.S. Residents</h4>

<p>Our servers are located in the US. If you are located outside of the US, please be aware that any information provided to us, including personal information, will be transferred from your country of origin to the US. Except in the case of data transfers under the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, your decision to provide such data to us, or allow us to collect such data through our Site or the Services, constitutes your consent to this data transfer.</p>

<h4 id="important-notice-for-residents-of-the-european-economic-area">Important Notice for Residents of the European Economic Area</h4>

Stitch has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability (the “Privacy Shield Principles”). With regard to the Principle of Accountability for Onward Transfer, for example, we remain liable if our agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. If there is a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov</a>.</p>

<p>Stitch is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.
In compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles, Stitch commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.  EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy should first contact Stitch at privacy@stitchdata.com.</p>

<p>Stitch has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles to BBB PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Stitch, please visit <a href="http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/">www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers</a> for more information and to file a complaint. If these processes do not result in a resolution, you may also contact your local data protection authority, the US Department of Commerce, and/or the Federal Trade Commission for assistance. If your complaint still remains unresolved, then you have the right to invoke binding arbitration by the Privacy Shield Panel upon written notice to Stitch at privacy@stitchdata.com.</p>

<h4 id="california-privacy-rights">California Privacy Rights</h4>

<p>Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to obtain certain information about the types of personal information that companies with whom they have an established business relationship (and that are not otherwise exempt) have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year, including the names and addresses of those third parties, and examples of the types of services or products marketed by those third parties. If you wish to submit a request pursuant to Section 1798.83, please contact Stitch via email at privacy@stitchdata.com.</p>
