<div class="content_text"><p>Thank you for visiting our website. We at ANDREAS STIHL AG &amp; Co. KG appreciate your interest in our company and our products. Privacy is not an empty word for us, and we take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We handle your data with due care, treat it as confidential and use it only in accordance with the applicable data protection laws and regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Personal data</strong><br>
When you visit our website, we automatically record the name of your internet service provider, the website from which you visit us, the pages of our website you actually visit and the date and length of your visit as well as information about the equipment (brand, model, operating system) and the internet browser you have used. We also collect your IP address, but with the last four digits anonymised.</p>

<p><strong>Use of cookies</strong><br>
On various pages of our website, we use cookies in order to make our website more attractive to visitors and to enable the use of certain functions. Cookies are small data files that are stored on your terminal equipment. Some of the cookies we use are deleted at the end of the browser session, i.e. as soon as you close your browser (so-called session cookies). Other cookies remain on your computer and allow us or our partner companies to recognise your computer on your next visit (so-called permanent cookies).</p>

<p>Cookies cannot be used to access other files on your computer or to reveal your email address.</p>

<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies automatically. If you use your browser's default settings, all processes will be running quietly in the background. Nevertheless, you can change your settings at any time.</p>

<p>You can set your browser to inform you every time before storing cookies and decide on a case-by-case basis, whether to accept them. You can also limit the acceptance of cookies to certain cases or block the acceptance of cookies altogether.</p>

<p>However, without cookies, the features of some websites - including ours - will not function properly, as these files are used in processes, e.g. to manage wish lists.</p>

<p><strong>Newsletters and the ordering of printed materials</strong><br>
If you would like to subscribe to the newsletter offered on our website, we require a valid email address from you. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time. When you order printed materials, we require personal data from you in order to process your request correctly. Filling out these forms is completely optional. We will only use your data to the extent necessary to fulfil the purpose it was collected for. Where necessary, your data may be disclosed within the STIHL Group.</p>

<p><strong>Protection of personal data</strong><br>
ANDREAS STIHL AG &amp; Co. KG uses technical and organisational measures to protect your data against accidental modification, loss, unauthorised access or unauthorised disclosure.</p>

<p><strong>Website analysis using Google Analytics</strong><br>
This website uses Google Analytics, a website analysis service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", i.e. text files saved to your computer and facilitate an analysis of the way you use the website.

<p><strong>Google Tag Manager</strong><br>
Google Tag Manager is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, US ("Google") and can be used to create, update and manage tags.</p>

<p>Tags are snippets of code on our website, which are used i.a. to measure traffic and visitor behaviour and to detect the impact of online advertising and social channels.</p>

<p>When you visit our website, the current tag configuration is sent to the end-user's browser with instructions for which tags should fire. The tool itself does not collect any personally identifiable information. The tool instructs other tags to fire, and these other tags may collect data. For more information on how Google Tag Manager works please visit: <a href="https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772432?hl=en&amp;topic=2574304&amp;ctx=topic " target="_blank">https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772432?hl=en&amp;topic=2574304&amp;ctx=topic</a> and the use policy: <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/use-policy/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/use-policy/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Social media and social plugins</strong><br>
We also provide comprehensive individual support via our pages on social media. If you make a query through one of these social media sites, we will forward your query on to the relevant department. The data will be used solely for the purpose of responding to your query and will not be disclosed to third parties. If you wish to contact us through social media sites, you must be logged into your respective accounts. The companies that operate these services may collect, store and use personal data for this purpose. We have no control over the nature, scope and the processing of this data.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing content via social networks with Shariff</strong><br>
We use "Shariff", a solution by Heise, to embed the social plugins from Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Instagram with sharing function ("Share", "+1", "Camera"/"share", "camera icon").</p>

<p>Shariff prevents your IP address from being transmitted to social network providers. Instead of your IP address, only the server address is transmitted, and your personal data is therefore not disclosed to third parties.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Facebook plugins</strong><br>
Our website uses social plugins (“plugins”) provided by the social network Facebook, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, US (“Facebook”). You can find an overview of the Facebook plugins and their appearance here: <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins?locale=en_US" target="_blank">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins?locale=en_US</a>.<br>
If you access a page on our website that contains this social plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection with Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is then transmitted by Facebook directly to your browser and embedded into the page. By integrating the plugin, Facebook receives the information that your browser has accessed a particular page on our website, even if you do not have a Facebook account, or you are currently not logged into Facebook. This information (including your IP address) is transmitted by your browser directly to a Facebook server in the US and stored there. If you are logged into Facebook, Facebook can link the visit to our website directly to your Facebook account. If you interact using the plugins, for example, e.g. by writing a comment, this information is also transmitted directly to a server of the relevant provider and stored there. The information is also posted on your Facebook profile and displayed to your Facebook friends. Please note that we as the website providers do not receive any information about the content of the transmitted data or its use by Facebook. For more information on the purpose and scope of collection, further processing and the use of data by Facebook as well as your rights and the options available to protect your privacy, please refer to the privacy policy of Facebook: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/policy.php" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>.<br>
If you do not want Facebook to associate the data collected on our website directly with your Facebook account, you must log out from Facebook before visiting our website. You can also prevent the loading of Facebook plugins completely, e.g. by using the "Facebook Blocker" (<a href="http://webgraph.com/resources/facebookblocker/" target="_blank">http://webgraph.com/resources/facebookblocker/</a>).</p>

<p>If you access a page on our website that contains such a plugin, your browser will establish a direct connection with Google servers.

The content of the plugin is then transmitted by AddThis directly to your browser and embedded into the page. By integrating the plugin, AddThis receives the information that your browser has accessed a particular page on our website, and stores a cookie to identify your browser on your terminal equipment.
