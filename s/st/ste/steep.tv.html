                                <p>We're always working to make our services even better. One of the ways we do that is by analyzing information we collect and receive about users in order to figure out what they might be interested in. This helps us develop more engaging content and provide more effective advertising, which enables us to keep most of our services free.</p>
                                <p>This Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information we collect and receive about users. There are three things you should keep in mind as you read it:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>First, the Privacy Policy applies to SteepTV services that link to or refer to this Privacy Policy. These services include websites, mobile apps, other online services and anything else that links to or refers to this policy. To keep things simple, we refer to all these services as our "Services."</li>
                                    <li>Second, the Privacy Policy applies no matter what computer or device you use to access our Services.</li>
                                    <li>Third, we may provide additional information about the privacy practices of some of our Services. Although this Privacy Policy applies to all SteepTV services that refer or link to it, you should read the additional information, too. Some of this information is linked from various places in the Privacy Policy, and some is available through the individual Services that you use.
                                        We've done our best to keep this Privacy Policy short and simple, but if you have any questions about it, we hope you'll let us know.</li>
                                </ul>

In the event that the ownership of SteepTV Inc. or an affiliate or their assets changes as a result of a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, your information may be transferred to another company. If we believe a transfer results in a material change in the use of the information we've collected or received about you, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of the transfer.</li>

                                <p>Companies that provide services to us or act on our behalf may have access to information about you. These companies are limited in their ability to use information they receive in the course of providing services to us.</p>

                                <h2>Third Parties that Provide Content, Advertising Services, or Functionality on Our Services</h2>
                                <p>Some of the content, advertising, and functionality on our Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us. Such third parties include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Advertising providers, which help us and our advertising customers provide ads that are tailored to users' interests and understand how users respond to those ads;</li>
                                    <li>Audience-measurement companies, which help us measure the overall usage of our Services and compare that usage to other online services; and</li>
                                    <li>Social networking services (like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google ) that enable you to login to certain of our Services and to share things you find on our Services with your social network.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>These and other third parties may collect or receive information about your use of our Services, including through the use of cookies, web beacons and other technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected on different websites and online services.</p>
                                <p>Note that some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers with choices about whether to receive targeted ads. To learn more, please visit the websites of the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance.</p>
                                <p>If you choose to connect with a social networking service, such as Facebook, we may share information with that service, and that service may share information about you with us. We may use the information for the reasons explained in this Privacy Policy, but the main reason we use it is to make your experience on our Services more personal and social. For example, we might show you what content is popular among your connections on the social networking service or give you a glimpse of what your friends are saying about that content.</p>
                                <p>It's important to remember that we don't control the privacy practices of these (or any other) third-party services. So we encourage you to read the privacy policies of the services before connecting to them.</p>

                                <h2>"Do Not Track" Signals</h2>
                                <p>Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. SteepTV currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard for responding is established, we may revisit its policy on responding to these signals.</p>

                                <p>Although no one can guarantee the security of the information collected and received, we do employ a number of safeguards intended to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access or disclosure of this information. Examples of the types of safeguards we may provide (depending on the circumstances) include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Storing the data you provide in controlled facilities;</li>
                                    <li>Using HTTPS encryption when you authenticate (i.e., log into one of our Services), which helps prevent unauthorized access to your login credentials;</li>
                                    <li>Limiting access to personal information to employees who need that access to perform their jobs; and</li>
                                    <li>Providing company-wide training on privacy and data security.</li>
                                </ul>
