    <p><strong>SECTION 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR  INFORMATION?</strong><br>
      When you  purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and selling process,  we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and  email address. When you  browse our store, we also automatically receive your computer’s internet  protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information that helps us  learn about your browser and operating system.<br>
    Email  marketing (if applicable): With your permission, we may send you emails about  our store, new products and other updates.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SECTION 2 - CONSENT</strong><br>
      How do you  get my consent?<br>
      When you  provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your  credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we  imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific  reason only. If we ask  for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will  either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an  opportunity to say no.</p>
    <p>How do I  withdraw my consent?<br>
      If after  you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to  contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your  information, at anytime, by contacting us at orders@stereolabs.com or mailing  us at:<br>
      STEREOLABS<br>
      Bat. 503, Centre Scientifique d'Orsay,&nbsp; 91400 Orsay, FR</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</strong><br>
      We may  disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you  violate our Terms of Service.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SECTION 4 - SHOPIFY</strong><br>
      Our store  is hosted on Shopify Inc. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform  that allows us to sell our products and services to you. Your data  is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases and the general Shopify  application. They store your data on a secure server behind a firewall.</p>
    <p>Payment:<br>
      If you  choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify stores  your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data  Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as  long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete,  your purchase transaction information is deleted.<br>
      All direct  payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI  Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa,  MasterCard, American Express and Discover.<br>
      PCI-DSS  requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our  store and its service providers. For more  insight, you may also want to read Shopify’s Terms of Service here or Privacy  Statement here.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</strong><br>
      In general,  the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your  information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they  provide to us. However,  certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other  payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to  the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related  transactions.<br>
      For these  providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can  understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by  these providers. In  particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have  facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So  if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a  third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the  laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities  are located.<br>
      As an example,  if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment  gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in  completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States  legislation, including the Patriot Act.<br>
      Once you  leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or  application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s  Terms of Service.</p>
    <p>Links<br>
      When you  click on links on our store, they may direct you away from our site. We are not  responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read  their privacy statements.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SECTION 6 - SECURITY</strong><br>
      To protect  your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry  best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed,  disclosed, altered or destroyed. If you  provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted  using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256  encryption.&nbsp; Although no method of  transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow  all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry  standards.</p>
