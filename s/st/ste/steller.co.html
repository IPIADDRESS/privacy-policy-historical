            <h1>Steller Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p>This Privacy Policy governs the privacy of information Mombo Labs, Inc. ("Mombo") collects inside the Steller mobile application and Steller website (the "Service"). &nbsp;This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Mombo does not own or control. This policy includes examples of the types of information Mombo collects, and the kinds of parties with whom Mombo shares such information. These examples are illustrative and should not be considered a complete inventory of Mombo's information collection, use, and sharing practices. &nbsp;By installing, using, or accessing the Service, you agree to this policy. If you do not agree to this policy, do not install, use, or access the Service. Mombo may update this policy from time to time and will post updates to this policy on this web page, including the policy's effective date. &nbsp;By your use of the Service, you understand and consent to the collection and use of your data, the transfer of that data around the United States and other countries for storage, processing, and use by Mombo.</p>

            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>Mombo collects a variety of information through general use of the Service that help us convey to users your identify, validate that identity, and help us to deliver a better experience for you in the Service.</p>

            <h2>Information Upon Registration</h2>
            <p>When creating an account on Steller, you do so by authenticating through a third-party service, such Twitter. By doing so, you link your Twitter account with the Steller application, and Steller collects and stores information from such service about your public identify that you have provided to Steller and have consented to share to us. Steller also asks for and stores an email you provide upon registration. We do so to be able to contact you and validate your identity if so needed. &nbsp;As part of providing you the Service, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Service and your Steller account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.</p>

            <h2>Content, Following, and other Public Information</h2>
            <p>Steller is a content sharing platform, so most of the information you provide us is information that you choose to be made public. This includes not only the content that you post and data provided with such content, such as when it was posted, but also the accounts you follow, the content that you like and other public interactions on the Services. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated.</p>

            <h2>Location Information</h2>
            <p>Mombo collects location information from users for reporting purposes to better understand our users and where they interact with Steller. By collecting your IP address and geolocation, Mombo can better understand you and deliver a better, more personalized experience for you.</p>

            <h2>Links</h2>
            <p>Mombo may keep analytical data on the links, content, and gestures you interact with within the Service to understand better how you use Steller, content that users interact with, and general trends across these links, content, and gestures in the Service. We do this to improve the Service, to better understand our users, and deliver more relevant advertising and engagement statistics for users to share popularity and trending information.</p>

            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>Mombo uses "cookies" to allow us to better understand how our users use the Service. Cookies themselves are small pieces of text that are stored by your web browser associated with each visit. Mombo uses cookies to help us understand how and when you use the Service. These cookies are not personally associated with your real identity, they simply enable us to understand when users are logged in and key functionality so that we are able to provide you with a higher quality, targeted service and understand aggregate user trends.</p>

            <h2>Log Data</h2>
            <p>Mombo servers automatically record data ("Log Data") created by your use of the Service. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive this log information when you interact with the Service by interacting with our mobile application, visiting our website, signing into the Service, or visiting a third party site or service that includes a Steller widget. Mombo uses this data to measure, understand, and improve the Service to you.</p>

            <h2>Information Disclosure</h2>
            <p>Mombo may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you choose to publicly post content or update your profile information. Mombo may provide information on a confidential basis to nonaffiliated companies Mombo engages as contractors or agents to perform services for Mombo, such as hosting services or maintaining software. Information will be shared with such third party service providers only to the extent reasonably necessary for them to perform services on Mombo's behalf, and pursuant to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, Mombo may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Mombo's rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's, including a government's, request to disclose your information. </p>
            <p>If Mombo is involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, or if Mombo goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information may be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any of the acquirer of Mombo or our assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information, public posts, the people you follow or that follow you, or the number of users who clicked on a particular link.</p>

            <h2>Modifying Your Personal Information</h2>
            <p>If you are a registered user of our Service, you may modify the profile information you provided or made available to us and associated with your account.</p>

            <h2>Users Under Age 13</h2>
            <p>Steller services are not intended for persons under the age of 13. If you become aware that a user under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information without the consent of an adult who has custody over that child, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@mombo.com">support@mombo.com</a>. Mombo never knowingly accepts personal information from users under the age of 13 and if we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take action to remove the information and terminate the user's account.</p>
