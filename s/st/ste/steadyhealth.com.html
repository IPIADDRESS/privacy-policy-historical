                     <li><a href="http://news.steadyhealth.com/Food-Nutrition/football-world-cup-the-england-boys-tuck-box/" title="What does the England football squad's supermarket shopping list tell us about the players, and can the team be cooked to World Cup glory?With the World Cup kicking off next month in South Africa, it's obviously time to deal with the most important, decisive and fundamental issue obsessing those involved with pre-championship preparations. And that, of course, is their shopping list. The England team's official supermarket â�� which, being Tesco, is almost everybody else's official supermarket â�� has revealed the goods they have asked to take with them to training camp.And what an intriguing list it is. First though, a word of warning. Football is a closed, burned and buried book to me. I have never been able to understand how adults can invest their emotional wellbeing in the activities of a bunch of blokes they have never met and over whose performance they have absolutely no control. An England victory does not make me feel more in love with my country, or think it a more remarkable place. There's a ball, a bunch of men â�� hell, I'm not even sure how many â�� and a field.Plus I WAS ALWAYS THE LAST ONE TO GET PICKED AT PRIMARY SCHOOL.Yes, OK. That might have something to do with it.I do however have a gym habit and as a man with a metabolism slower than a Skoda 10,000 miles overdue for its next service and a job which requires eating on a scale that would encourage a gavage goose to feel sorry for me, I do understand a little bit about the relationship between food and fitness. Not much, but a bit.So, what does this list tell us? There's a whole bunch of rice there, though the fact that it is specifically Arborio may merely indicate that manager Fabio Capello is determined to make a shed load of risotto while he is in Africa. Still we'd expect the diet to be high in complex carbohydrates, with a nice slow burn rate to help get them through the monotonous drudge â�� I mean thrilling spectacle â�� of each game. The Tesco nutritionist has tried to sell the presence of things like strawberry and raspberry jam on the list as more proof of the search for high sugar fuels. However, put those alongside the orders for custard and brown sauce, and you begin to get more of a sense of the team: a bunch of very English lads, being prepared for homesickness even before they've left the tarmac.That, meanwhile, is balanced by the condiments order which is actually rather thrilling: wasabi paste and sweet chilli sauce, peri-peri sauce and the grand daddy of them all, Tabasco. The latter is a fabulous touch: a bottle should be in every properly stocked store cupboard. Even the British Army put small bottles of it in the recently re-launched ration packs.The rest speaks of a very modern Englishness, of the high street food culture that the empire gifted us. We have historically always been far more open to other culinary traditions because of all the wonderful countries that we invaded and subjugated. That, combined with a rather weak indigenous food culture has meant that average young English men â�� and for all their seven figure salaries, the squad are still that â�� have probably eaten far more widely than their counterparts elsewhere. They are used to Japanese and Thai food, to the likes of Nandos or Yo Sushi or Ping Pong. They live in fear of blandness. And so as they prepare to set off on the long trek south it makes sense that they should be stocking up on this stuff.The order for all the herbal teas? Look, they may be footballers but they are still firmly in touch with their metrosexual side. Only real men drink peppermint tea.And that, for now, is it. So what do you make of the snippets of information that we have on their diet? And if you were running the England team kitchen what exactly would you be serving up? What should be on the menu and what should be off? And do you think it's possible for a crack brigade of chefs to help cook the England boys to victory?Food &amp; drinkWorld Cup 2010Jay Raynerguardian.co.uk &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our Terms &amp; Conditions | More Feeds">Football World Cup: the England boys' tuck box</a></li>

        HOW LONG DO YOU KEEP THE INFORMATION I'VE GIVEN YOU?
        </h3>
        <p>
        We keep the information you have given us for as long as you are a member on the site or for as long as we are required to do so by law, which ever is longer.
        </p><h3>
        CAN I CHANGE THE INFORMATION I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN YOU?

        You can always verify or request the removal of the personally identifiable information we have collected and change your registration information by selecting "Profile" from the main menu on the site.
        </p><h3>
        DO YOU MONITOR ONLINE BEHAVIOR?
        </h3>
        <p>
        This is a community site where the members communicate to share the information using our forums. Also our members communicate with each other through instant private messages. We do not, as a rule, monitor members' private message exchanges, but we reserve the right to do so if user is using our service for the purpose of solicitation or any other violation of our Terms of Use or Privacy Act.

        WHAT SECURITY FEATURES DO YOU HAVE?
        </h3>
        <p>
        The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL is the leading security protocol on the Internet, it ensures that information being transferred over the network is private through a process called encryption. Once encrypted the information is an unintelligible code until it is decoded upon arrival at the authorized destination.
        </p><p>
        We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
