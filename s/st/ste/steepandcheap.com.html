<h2 id="effective-may-19-2014">Effective May 19, 2014</h2>
<h2 id="our-commitment-to-privacy">Our Commitment To Privacy</h2>
<p>Your privacy is important to us.   To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our  online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your  information is collected and used.  To  make this policy easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at  every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.  In this policy, “Personal Information” is  defined as data and facts about you that is collected by Backcountry.com (“Backcountry”)  or its affiliate websites, but does not include your IP address.</p>
<h2 id="the-information-we-collect">The Information We Collect</h2>
<p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on the Backcountry  website, including all affiliated websites, including but not limited to:  Backcountry.com,  Competitivecyclist.com,  Chainlove.com, Dogfunk.com,  SteepandCheap.com,  and WhiskeyMilitia.com.  On some pages,  you can order products, make requests, submit product reviews, and register to  receive materials or communications from us.   The types of Personal Information collected at these pages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Phone number</li>
<li>Credit/Debit card information</li>
<li>Transaction Information</li>
</ul>
<p>On some pages, you can submit information about other people.  For example, if you order a gift online and  want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient’s  address.  In this circumstance, the types  of Personal Information collected are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Phone number</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-way-we-use-information">The Way We Use Information</h2>
<p>Backcountry  does not sell, rent or provide your "Personal Information" to third  parties, except as described below.   Personal Information is generally kept for Backcountry business which is  primarily used to assist you in your current or future purchases or in  analyzing sales trends.</p>
<p>  We  use your Personal Information you provide about yourself when placing an order  primarily to complete that order.   Personal Information from the order form is used to send orders,  information about our company, and promotional material from some of our  partners to our customers.  Personal  Information is also used to get in touch with the customer when necessary.  Users may opt-out of receiving future  mailings by following the directions in those mailings.</p>
<p>  Backcountry  sometimes uses online surveys which ask visitors for Personal Information which  usually includes contact information (typically the customer's email address)  and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use  Personal Information gathered from our surveys to send the user promotional  material from Backcountry.  Backcountry  periodically runs contests on our site in which we ask visitors for selected  Personal Information such as contact information (typically the customer's  email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income  level). We use Personal Information gathered from our contests to send users  promotional material from Backcountry and at times, to some of our  partners.  The customer's Personal  Information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary (i.e. when  someone wins a contest.). Demographic and profile data is also collected at our  site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing  them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the  content according to their preferences.</p>
<p>  Backcountry  shares Personal Information with third parties in certain limited  circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backcountry may share Personal  Information with a third party with your consent.  For example, you have the option to enroll in  Bill Me Later, which is an independent third-party payment service.  If you choose to enroll in Bill Me Later, we  will share your email address with Bill Me Later to facilitate the enrollment  process and Bill Me Later’s subsequent use of your Personal Information will be  governed by Bill Me Later’s Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>Backcountry may provide Personal  Information to affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for  the purpose of processing Personal Information on our behalf.  Backcountry requires that these parties agree  to process your Personal Information based on our instructions and in  compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality  and security measures.  These third  parties may only use your Personal Information to the extent required to  perform their services on our behalf.</li>
<li><p>We may provide Personal Information to  third parties or marketers for their marketing purposes.  We do not provide your entire credit card or  debit card numbers to any of these third parties or marketers, but may provide  the last four digits of those numbers to a third party or marketer to aid those  third parties or marketers in differentiating individuals from one another.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We may buy or sell subsidiaries or  business units.  Generally, in these  transactions, customer information (including Personal Information) is a  transferred asset.  That information will  remain subject to the then-existing Privacy Policy until or unless you provide  consent for any updated use of your Personal Information.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We may share Personal Information to  the extent required by legal process or enforceable governmental request.</p>
</li>
<li>We may share Personal Information with  third parties to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or  technical issues.  These third parties  may place and read cookies on your browsers, or may use web beacons or similar  technologies to collect information in connection with the Google Trusted  Merchant Program.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cookies-and-ip-addresses">Cookies And IP Addresses</h2>
<p>Backcountry  also collects, uses, and monetizes IP Addresses.  An IP Address is a convention of the Internet  Protocol that identifies your "virtual" address on the internet. This  IP Address is not personal to you and does not identify any of your Personal  Information.  All devices connected to a  network have an IP Address permitting communication to and from the  device.  If you connect to the Internet  from your computer, then you have an IP Address that looks something like this:  209.17.654.152.  In the simplest possible  terms, your IP Address contains no data that identifies you as a person.  It is only a logical address allowing you to  connect to others and others to locate your computer.  We use an IP Address for a number of uses as  set forth herein.  We use an IP Address  to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. The  IP Address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather  broad demographic information.  </p>
<p>  Our  site uses cookies (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time  on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) to keep track of your shopping  cart.  We use cookies for other purposes  such as site personalization.  You can  reject cookies and still use the Backcountry site, however, it will disable the  ability for the site to recognize your cart, your account and any  personalization efforts.</p>
<p>  In  addition to the disclosure of Personal Information to third parties as  described above, Backcountry may monetize or otherwise provide anonymous IP  Addresses to other third parties.  Backcountry  sometimes employs other companies and individuals to perform functions on our  behalf.  Examples of such may include  hosting our website, providing marketing assistance, providing search results  and links, retargeted advertising, analyzing data, etc.  These third parties have access only to IP  Addresses and do not have access to your Personal Information.  However, as disclosed above, Backcountry may  disclose Personal Information to third parties in certain limited  circumstances.</p>
