		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<h2>Our Commitment To Privacy</h2>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this policy easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. In this policy, "Personal Information" is defined as data and facts about you that is collected by SteepandCheap.com or its affiliate websites but does not include your IP address.</p>

<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
<p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on the SteepandCheap website, including all affiliated websites, including but not limited to: Backcountry.com, DepartmentOfGoods.com, Dogfunk.com, HucknRoll.com, RealCyclist.com, SteepandCheap.com, WhiskeyMilitia.com, Chainlove.com, and Bonktown.com. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, submit product reviews, and register to receive materials or communications from us. The types of Personal Information collected at these pages are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Address</li>
  <li>Email address</li>
  <li>Phone number</li>
  <li>Credit/Debit card information</li>
</ul>
<p>On some pages, you can submit information about other people.  For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's address.  In this circumstance, the types of Personal Information collected are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Address</li>
  <li>Email address</li>
  <li>Phone number</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Way We Use Information</h2>
<p>SteepandCheap does not sell, rent, or provide your "Personal Information" to third parties, except as described below. Personal Information is generally kept for SteepandCheap business, which is primarily used to assist you in your current or future purchases or in analyzing sales trends.</p>
<p>We use your Personal Information you provide about yourself when placing an order primarily to complete that order. Personal Information from the order form is used to send orders, information about our company, and promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. Personal Information is also used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by following the directions in those mailings.</p>
<p>SteepandCheap sometimes uses online surveys that ask visitors for Personal Information, which usually includes contact information (typically the customer's email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use Personal Information gathered from our surveys to send the user promotional material from SteepandCheap.  SteepandCheap periodically runs contests on our site in which we ask visitors for selected Personal Information such as contact information (typically the customer's email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use Personal Information gathered from our contests to send users promotional material from SteepandCheap and at times, to some of our partners. The customer's Personal Information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary (i.e. when someone wins a contest). Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in and displaying the content according to their preferences.</p>
<p>SteepandCheap shares Personal Information with third parties in certain limited circumstances.  First, SteepandCheap may share Personal Information with a third party with your consent. For example, you have the option to enroll in Bill Me Later, which is an independent third-party payment service. If you choose to enroll in Bill Me Later, we will share your email address with Bill Me Later to facilitate the enrollment process, and Bill Me Later's subsequent use of your Personal Information will be governed by Bill Me Later's Privacy Policy. Second, SteepandCheap may provide Personal Information to affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing Personal Information on our behalf. SteepandCheap requires that these parties agree to process your Personal Information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. Third, we may share Personal Information to the extent required by legal process or enforceable governmental request. Fourth, we may share Personal Information with third parties to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues. These third parties may place and read cookies on your browsers, or may use web beacons or similar technologies to collect information in connection with the Google Trusted Merchant Program.</p>

<h2>Cookies And IP Addresses</h2>
<p>SteepandCheap also collects, uses, and monetizes IP Addresses. An IP Address is a convention of the Internet Protocol that identifies your "virtual" address on the internet. This IP Address is not personal to you and does not identify any of your Personal Information. All devices connected to a network have an IP Address permitting communication to and from the device. If you connect to the Internet from your computer, then you have an IP Address that looks something like this: 209.17.654.152.  In the simplest possible terms, your IP Address contains no data that identifies you as a person. It is only a logical address allowing you to connect to others and others to locate your computer. We use an IP Address for a number of uses as set forth herein. We use an IP Address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. The IP Address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information.</p> 
<p>Our site uses cookies (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) to keep track of your shopping cart. We use cookies for other purposes such as site personalization. You can reject cookies and still use the SteepandCheap site; however, it will disable the ability for the site to recognize your cart or your account, and it bypasses any personalization efforts.</p>
<p>In addition to the disclosure of Personal Information to third parties as described above, SteepandCheap may monetize or otherwise provide anonymous IP Addresses to other third parties. SteepandCheap sometimes employs other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples of such may include hosting our website, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links, retargeted advertising, analyzing data, etc. These third parties have access only to IP Addresses and do not have access to your Personal Information. However, as disclosed above, SteepandCheap may disclose Personal Information to third parties in certain limited circumstances.</p>

<h2>One Deal at a Time</h2>
At Steep and Cheap, we sell premium, core outdoor gear and
clothing at prices that are downright criminal. Here’s how it
works: Steep and Cheap sells one screamin’ deal at a time
until it’s gone. The deals are fat, so they sell out fast. You have to act fast or
you’ll miss it, but don’t stress—as soon
as one deal sells out, we kick off another. It’s back-to-back
deals all day long. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sales.liveperson.net/hc/s-9551721/cmd/kbresource/kb-3432330500148897931/view_question!PAGETYPE?sc=490&amp;sp=101&amp;sf=101133&amp;documentid=340727&amp;action=view&amp;VisitorProfile=SAC&amp;MESSAGEVAR!home=yes&amp;MESSAGEVAR!cookie=no&amp;MESSAGEVAR!docid=340727">Learn more</a>.
