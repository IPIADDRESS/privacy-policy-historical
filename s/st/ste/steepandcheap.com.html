            We collect visitor's contact information including but not limited to addresses, email addresses, 
            phone numbers and financial information (account or credit card numbers). Contact information from 
            the order form is used to send orders, information about our company, and promotional material from some

            the customer when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings. Information is gathered by

            </p><p>
		     Financial information that is collected by Steepandcheap.com is used to bill the user for products and services. 
             Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (typically the customer's email address) and demographic 
             information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send the 
             user promotional material from Steepandcheap.com. 
            </p><p>
             Customer information is considered to be an asset of Steepandcheap.com and as such may be transferred to 
             another company as part of an acquisition of Steepandcheap.com.
</p><p>	
<font class="help_center_title">Contests</font><br>
			We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (typically the customer's email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level).			<br>
			<br>
			We use contact data from our contests to send users promotional material from Steepandcheap.com and at times, some of our partners. When partners will receive the customer's information, it will be disclosed as such. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary (i.e. When someone wins a contest.) Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 						<br>
			<br>
			<font class="toptitle1">The Scoop on Secure Transactions</font><br>
			<br>
			Can I safely transmit information such as credit card numbers?
			</p><p>You can enter your credit card number on a secure (https) form and transmit the form over the Internet to a secure server without risk of an intermediary obtaining your credit card information. The security features offered by your web browser technology protects commercial transactions, as well as all other communications, from misappropriation and fraud that could otherwise occur as information passes through Internet computers.</p>
			<p>With SSL implemented on both the client and server, your Internet communications are transmitted in encrypted form. Information you send can be trusted to arrive privately and unaltered to the server you specify (and no other).</p>
			<p>SSL uses authentication and encryption technology. For example, your browsers export implementation of SSL (U.S. government approved) uses a High-grade, 128-bit key size. The encryption established between you and a server remains valid over multiple connections, yet the effort expended to defeat the encryption of one message cannot be leveraged to defeat the next message.</p>
			<p>Your browser and secure servers deliver server authentication using signed digital certificates issued by trusted third parties known as certificate authorities. A digital certificate verifies the connection between a server's public key and the server's identification (just as a driver's license verifies the connection between your photograph and your personal identification. Cryptographic checks, using digital signatures, ensure that information within a certificate can be trusted.</p>
			<p>You can tell when you have a secure connection by looking at the location (URL) field. If the URL begins with https:// (instead of http://), the document comes from a secure server. To connect to an HTTP server that provides security using the SSL protocol, insert the letter "s" so that the URL begins with https://. You need to use https:// for HTTP URLs with SSL and http:// for HTTP URLs without SSL..</p>
			<p>You can also verify the security of a document by examining the security icon in the bottom-left corner of the browser window.</p>
			<p>Only your computer and the server can encrypt and decrypt your information. In transit, the information is an unreadable jumble. An intermediary can continue to route the data, and even make copies of it, but the information cannot be decrypted and remains private and safely communicated. <br>
