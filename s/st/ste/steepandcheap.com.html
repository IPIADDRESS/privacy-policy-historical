<h2>One Deal at a Time</h2>
At Steep and Cheap, we sell premium, core outdoor gear and
clothing at prices that are downright criminal. Here’s how it
works: Steep and Cheap sells one screamin’ deal at a time
until it’s gone. The deals are fat (up to 80% off and no less
than 50% off), so they sell out fast. You have to act fast or
you’ll miss it, but don’t stress—as soon
as one deal sells out, we kick off another. It’s back-to-back
deals all day long. <a href="http://www.steepandcheap.com/steepcheap/help/227/One-Deal-at-a-Time.html">Learn more</a>.
