            <p>We have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and the
               protection of your information.
            </p><p><strong>Why did you receive a mailing from us?</strong>
            </p><p>Our email marketing is permission based. If you received a mailing from us, our records
            indicate that (a) you have expressly shared this address for the purpose of receiving
            information in the future ("opt-in"), or (b) you have registered or purchased or otherwise
            have an existing relationship with us. We respect your time and attention by controlling
            the frequency of our mailings.
            </p><p>
            If you believe you have received unwanted, unsolicited email sent via this system or
            purporting to be sent via this system, please forward a copy of that email with your
            comments to <a href="mailto:abuse@constantcontact.com">abuse@constantcontact.com</a> for review.
            </p><p><strong>How can you stop receiving email from us?</strong>
            </p><p>Each email sent contains an easy, automated way for you to cease receiving email from
            us, or to change your expressed interests. If you wish to do this, simply follow the
            SafeUnsubscribeâ„¢ or Update Profile links at the end of any email.
            </p><p><strong>How we protect your privacy</strong>
            </p><p>We use appropriate security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data used by our system.
            </p><p><strong>Sharing and Usage</strong>
            </p><p>We will never share, sell, or rent individual personal information with anyone for their
            promotional use without your advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law.
            Information submitted to us is only available to employees managing this information for
            purposes of contacting you or sending you emails based on your request for information,
            and to contracted service providers for purposes of providing services relating to our
            communications with you.
            </p><p><strong>Use of Web Beacons</strong>
            </p><p>When we send you emails, we may include a web beacon to allow us to determine the
            number of people who open our emails. When you click on a link in an email, we may
            record this individual response to allow us to customize our offerings to you. Web
            beacons collect only limited information, such as a cookie identifier, time and date of a
            page being viewed, and a description of the page on which the Web Beacon resides (the URL).
            </p><p>Web Beacons can be refused when delivered via email. If you do not wish to receive
            Web Beacons via email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select
            Text only) emails via your email software.

            </p><p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong>
            </p><p>This policy was created on March 2008.
