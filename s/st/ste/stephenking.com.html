These analytics services may use tracking technologies to help us analyze Site users and how they use the Site. Information generated by these services may be transmitted to and stored by these service providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these service providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Site, compiling statistic reports on the Site’s activity, and providing other services relating to Site activity and other internet usage.</p><p>We may also engage and work with third parties to serve advertisements on the Site and/or on third party sites. These third parties may use tracking technologies to tailor ads to your interests based on your browsing of the Site and elsewhere on the internet, sometimes referred to as “interest-based advertising” and “online behavioral advertising (“Interest-based Advertising”), which may include sending you an ad on a third party site after you have left the Site (i.e., “retargeting”).</p><p>You may choose whether to receive Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs. Some of the advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>, and &nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a>&nbsp;for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see &nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.</p><p>We use Piwik for analytics services. The following opt out applies only to Piwik's services:</p><p><iframe src="https://stephenking.com/assets/piwik/index.php?module=CoreAdminHome&amp;action=optOut&amp;language=en" style="border: 0; height: 200px; width: 600px;"></iframe></p><h3>“Do Not Track”</h3><p>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms.
