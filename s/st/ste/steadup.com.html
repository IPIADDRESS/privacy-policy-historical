			  </p><blockquote>
			  <p align="justify">This website (the "Site") is owned and operated by Hrisoula Fragis
			  and we are committed to respecting your online privacy and
			  recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any
			  personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share
			  with us. Steadup has established this Privacy Policy to let you know what
			  information we may collect from you on the Site and how we may use that
			  information. Please take a moment to review the terms of our Privacy
			  Policy. By using the Site (including Steadup's search engine and any other
			  services offered on the Site), you agree to accept the terms of our
			  Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy,
			  please do not use the Site or our services. This Privacy Policy applies
			  only to information that we collect on the Site (or otherwise through our
			  search engine) and does not apply to information which we may collect by
			  other means.</p>
			  <p>Personal Information</p>
			  <p><u>Information We May Collect</u></p>
			  <p align="justify">Personal Information means any information that may be
			  used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and
			  last name, a home or other physical address and an email address. In
			  general, you can visit the Site and use its search engine and other
			  features without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal
			  Information about yourself. However, in order to access certain
			  information, services or features contained on the Site, we may require
			  you to provide Personal Information. For example, we will collect certain
			  Personal Information if you choose to subscribe to our mailing list or
			  send questions or comments to us via e-mail.</p>
			  <p><u>How We May Use Your Information</u></p>
			  <p align="justify">If you provide us with Personal Information, we may
			  retain and use that information for several purposes. For example, we may
			  use your Personal Information in order to process and fulfill any
			  transactions or services that you request, such as responding to your
			  questions or sending e-mails to our mailing list subscribers. We may also
			  use Personal Information to ensure compliance with our policies and
			  applicable law. In addition, we may send you periodic communications by
			  e-mail or regular mail, such as special offers or information on our
			  services. If you wish to opt out of receiving e-mail communications from
			  us at any time, simply follow the instructions for doing so in the e-mails
			  that you receive from us. If you need any further assistance, you can
			  contact us <a href="mailto:legal@Steadup.com">here</a></p>
			  <p><u>With Whom We May Share Your Information</u></p>
			  <p align="justify">If you choose to provide us with your Personal
			  Information on the Site, we may transfer that information within Steadup.
			  We may store and process Personal Information collected on our Site in the
			  United States or any other country in which Steadup or its agents maintain
			  facilities. By using our Site and services, you consent to the transfer of
			  your information among these facilities, including those located outside
			  your country. Third parties provide certain services available on the Site
			  on Steadup's behalf. For example, Service providers are an important means
			  by which Steadup maintains the Site and our mailing lists. Steadup may
			  provide information, including Personal Information that Steadup collects
			  on the Site, to third-party service providers to help us deliver programs,
			  products, information, and services. Steadup will take reasonable steps to
			  ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect
			  Personal Information on Steadup's behalf.</p>
			  <p align="justify">As Steadup develops, we may buy other businesses or their
			  assets or sell our business assets. Customer information is generally one
			  of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event
			  that Steadup or all of its assets are acquired, customer information would
			  be one of the transferred assets.</p>
			  <p align="justify">We reserve the right to disclose visitor information in
			  special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this
			  information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action
			  against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either
			  intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other visitors,
			  or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We also reserve
			  the right to disclose visitor information when we believe in good faith
			  that the law requires it.</p>
			  <p align="justify">Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we do not
			  currently intend to share your Personal Information with any third parties
			  without obtaining your consent. However, we may decide to do so in the
			  future, in which case we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly.</p>
			  <p>Aggregate Information</p>
			  <p align="justify">From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal,
			  statistical information about the use of the Site and our search engine,
			  such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they
			  stay on that page, and which search results or other hyperlinks, if any,
			  they "click" on. We collect this information through the use of "cookies"
			  and other tracking technologies, which are discussed in greater detail
			  below. We collect this information in order to determine which areas of
			  the Site, search terms and search results are most popular and to enhance
			  the Site for visitors. We may also group this information into aggregate
			  visitor data in order to describe the use of the Site and our search
			  engine to our existing or potential business partners, sponsors,
			  advertisers or other third parties, or in response to a government
			  request. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no
			  way personally identify you or any other visitors to the Site.</p>
			  <p><u>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</u></p>
			  <p align="justify">Some of our web pages utilize "cookies" and other
			  tracking technologies. A cookie is a small text file that a website
			  transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
			  Cookies may be used, for example, to collect information about website
			  activity. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or
			  not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to
			  notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies
			  with your browser. However, please be aware that some features of the Site
			  may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies. You may
			  occasionally get cookies from our advertisers or other third parties with
			  links on the Site. We do not control these cookies. The use of advertising
			  cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.
			  We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally
			  identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
			  <p align="justify">Tracking technologies may record information such as
			  Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser
			  software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and
			  times that our Site is accessed. We do not link the information we record
			  using tracking technologies to any personally identifiable information you
			  submit while on our site.</p>
			  <p>Search Engine</p>
			  <p align="justify">When you use our search engine, we may collect certain
			  non-personally identifiable information through the use of cookies and
			  other tracking technologies described above. For example, when you use our
			  search engine, we may keep track of which search terms are popular. If we
			  display advertising to you on the Site (including the search results pages
			  displayed after any searches you may run), such advertising may be related
			  to the search terms you entered. Steadup may present search result links
			  in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed
			  and may monitor click-throughs on an individual and an aggregate basis. We
			  use this information to understand and improve the quality of Steadup's
			  search technology. For instance, this data helps us determine how often
			  users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they
			  proceed to later results.</p>
			  <p align="justify">Certain search results may be "premium" results, which
			  consist of websites who have paid for placement in the search results.
			  These listings are provided by our business partners. These premium results may contain tracking
			  URLs provided by our partners to identify clicks from the search results page.
			  Again, information gathered by these means will not personally identify
			  you. Any information collected by our partners will be subject to their
			  privacy policy.</p>
			  <p>Links to Other Sites</p>
			  <p align="justify">Please be aware that when you are on the Site, you could
			  be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. For example, when
			  you use our search engine, the search results will provide links to other
			  sites from the Site's pages that take you outside the Site. These other
			  sites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data or solicit
			  Personal Information. The privacy policies of these other sites may be
			  significantly different from this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible
			  for the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot guarantee the
			  security of any of your Personal Information collected there.</p>
			  <p>Security</p>
			  <p align="justify">Wherever your Personal Information may be held within
			  Steadup or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate
			  steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from
			  unauthorized access or disclosure. Unfortunately, no data transmission
			  over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while
			  we strive to protect your Personal Information and privacy, we cannot
			  guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or
			  transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft,
			  destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your Personal Information.</p>
			  <p>Updating Your Information</p>
			  <p align="justify">To the extent that you do provide us with Personal
			  Information, Steadup wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information. If
			  we collect Personal Information from you on the Web, you may send updates
			  and corrections about your Personal Information to <a href="mailto:legal@Steadup.com">legal@Steadup.com</a> and we will make
			  reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your Personal Information
			  that we hold as soon as practicable.</p>
			  <p>Children's Privacy</p>
			  <p align="justify">Steadup.com is not structured to attract children.
			  Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone
			  under 13 years of age. If you are under the age of 13, please do not
			  provide any Personal Information to us.</p>
			  <p>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</p>
			  <p align="justify">The terms of this Privacy Policy may change from time to
			  time without prior notice to you, so please check this page periodically
			  for any changes. By checking the "Last Modified" date above, you can
			  determine if this Privacy Policy has been updated since your last visit to
			  the Site. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes
			  to these terms will mean you accept those changes.</p>
			  <p>Governing Law</p>
			  <p align="justify">This Privacy Policy and the privacy practices of Steadup
			  will be subject exclusively to the laws of the province of Ontario within Canada. Steadup makes no representation that this
			  Privacy Policy and such practices comply with the laws of any other
			  country. Visitors who use the Site, the search engine or any other
			  services offered on the Site and reside outside the United States do so on
			  their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws,
			  if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>
			  <p align="justify">If you have any comments or questions regarding our
			  Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@Steadup.com">legal@Steadup.com</a>. While we cannot guarantee privacy perfection,
			  we will address any issue to the best of our abilities as soon as
			  possible.<br></p>
