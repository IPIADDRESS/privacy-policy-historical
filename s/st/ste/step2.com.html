						<u>Personal Information About You</u>
						</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica">
						When you send us personal information such as your email address, street address, age, etc., we use this information for limited and specific purposes including the following.

						3. If you are registering a ThunderVoltz<sup>TM</sup> battery-operated vehicle, we will log the requested information in a database which will be used in the unlikely event that we need to contact you regarding the care or use of the product you registered.

						<u>Special Notice for Parents: Personal Information About Your Child</u>
						</p><p>
						We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information directly from children, and we do not knowingly place children on our mailing list.  
						</p><p>
						The only instances in which we request information about your child are when you register a ThunderVoltz<sup>TM</sup> battery-operated vehicle or when you register to receive information by email in our "What's New" area. This information is used, in aggregate only, solely for the purpose of analyzing trends that help us develop new products or make adjustments to existing products. <i>Under no circumstances is this information used to knowingly market directly to your child or to contact your child.</i>

						<b>We DO NOT disclose any <i>personally identifiable</i> information about you or your child to any third parties.</b>  An exception to this would come in the event that we believe in good faith that we are required to disclose such information by a court of law.  Additionally, information <i>in aggregate</i> (i.e., not personally identifiable) such as the average age of children that use a particular product may be used to persuade retailers to carry a product.
