<p><span class="head2">Passive Information Collection</span><br>
This Site uses various technologies to passively collect information from you while you are visiting (that is, you do not actively provide this information). Such technologies allow the Site to collect a range of nonpersonally identifiable information, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address (a unique identifier automatically assigned to your computer when logging onto the Internet), the type of Web browser and operating system you use, the date and time you visit the Site, the specific pages you visit on the Site, and the address of the website you visited before coming to this Site. We typically use such passively collected information for a variety of purposes, such as to administer the Site, customize the Site to your preferences, and compile aggregated statistics for marketing and research purposes. We reserve the unrestricted right to use this passively collected, nonpersonally identifiable information, including, but not limited to, selling, leasing, permitting access to, or otherwise transferring it to our affiliates, business partners, advertisers, dealers, and other third parties.</p>
<p>Two types of passive information collection technologies deserve special mention:</p>
<p><span class="subhead-blue">Cookies</span><br>
"Cookies" are small text files that store information about your interactions with a particular website, either temporarily (known as a "temporary" or "session" cookie, and deleted once you close your browser window) or more permanently on the hard drive of your computer (known as a "permanent" or "persistent cookie"). Cookies can make it easier to use a website by allowing servers to access certain information quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Session cookies</strong> can be used to help a user's browser navigate a website more smoothly and may show up if the user comes from a website with which the subsequent website has some relationship (e.g., a website of an affiliated company) and can give helpful information.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent cookies</strong> can be used to customize a website for a user, such as by storing passwords, preferences, and registration and account information so that users do not have to reenter them each time they visit a website.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Site uses both session/temporary cookies and persistent/permanent cookies to store information that allows us to offer you better customer service and to navigate through the Site with ease. To make the Site easier to use, we combine information collected via cookies with personally identifiable information. Note that if you configure your browser to reject cookies, you might not be able to access important functions or areas of the Site or enjoy certain conveniences at this Site.</p>
<p><span class="subhead-blue">Web Beacons</span><br>
"Web beacons" (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are Internet tags that are smaller than cookies and may tell the website server nonpersonally identifiable information such as the IP address and browser type related to the user's computer. This Site does not use "Web beacons."</p>
<p><span class="head2">Other Uses and Disclosures of Information</span><br>
As indicated above, we use information we collect from you via this Site for a variety of purposes. Unless otherwise provided above, we may also use personally and nonpersonally identifiable information you submit via this Site in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>to tell you about new products and services or other information we think may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive such notifications or updates, please contact us at <strong><a class="lbb" href="mailto:DOTCOM@Steelcase.com">DOTCOM@Steelcase.com</a></strong> or <strong>DOTCOM, PO Box 1967, CD-4S-14, Grand Rapids, MI 49501-1967</strong> and specify which notifications or updates you do not wish to receive;</li>
<li>to conduct internal marketing and research; and</li>
<li>to improve the content of the Site.</li>
</ul>
<p>From time to time, our service providers may have access to information you submit via the Site to provide operational or other support services for the Site (e.g., Web hosting or database services). We have put in place agreements with such service providers to protect against unauthorized uses or disclosures of such information.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in the "Active Information Collection" section above, we also reserve the right to sell, lease, provide access, or otherwise transfer personally identifiable information you submit via this Site to our business partners (including e-mail delivery services and content providers), affiliates, and dealers for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or elsewhere on this Site, we reserve the right to share or transfer any information you submit via this Site to another person or company in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business of this Site and/or Steelcase Inc.; to respond to law enforcement requests; or where required by applicable law, statute, regulation, ordinance, subpoena, or court order. By submitting personally identifiable information via this Site, you consent to such disclosures in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
<p><span class="head2">Information Access</span><br>

<p>We will make reasonable efforts to respond to your inquiry, but we may require follow-up or contact information to allow us to verify that you are the person authorized to view the information you are requesting. We may, in our discretion, refuse to allow you access to certain information if, in our view, to provide such access would jeopardize another person's privacy; would violate any applicable federal, state, or foreign law, regulation, or directive; or would unreasonably burden this Site.</p>
<p><span class="head2">Data Security</span><br>
Although we take steps to protect personally identifiable information you provide via this Site from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration, no system is 100% secure or error-free. Therefore, we do not, and cannot, guarantee the security or accuracy of the information we collect via this Site, and you acknowledge that you are assuming the risk in transmitting any information to us.</p>
<p>We use the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) industry standard for encrypting all ordering data, including credit card transactions. SSL provides one of the highest levels of security available today for web-based sales, using encryption technologies developed by Verisign, Inc., and RSA Data Security, Inc. We also use CyberSource to process online credit card transactions. CyberSource is a leading developer and provider of enterprise eCommerce transaction services, and a pioneer in the area of Internet fraud detection. You should be aware that other transmissions submitted via this Site (e.g., forms, e-mails, etc.) are not protected by the same security measures we use for ordering data. As a result, you should be particularly careful in deciding what information you wish to send to us.</p>
<p><strong>It is your responsibility to safeguard any usernames and passwords you use to access portions of this Site and to notify us if you ever suspect that these usernames or passwords have been compromised. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for any unauthorized use of this Site conducted via your username or password.</strong></p>
