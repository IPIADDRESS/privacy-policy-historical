<h1 class="main">Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Steward's Privacy Policy helps assure that our clients, customers and visitors receive quality services with high integrity. The Policy describes how we collect, store and use information about visitors to the Steward website. It will be periodically assessed as new technologies are developed and when business practices or clients' needs change. When necessary, we will modify our Privacy Policy to reflect legal, technological and other developments. When modifications occur, they will appear in this policy statement.</p> 

<p>Steward is committed to using all reasonable efforts to abide by the following Policy statement: 
</p><ol>
<li><span id="mainEmphasis">Collection.</span> Personally-identifiable information will be collected only to the extent that Steward deems reasonably necessary to serve a legitimate business purpose.</li>
<li><span id="mainEmphasis">Notification.</span> Visitors will be notified (usually at the point where personally-identifiable information is collected) about how Steward may use the personally-identifiable information that is collected from them.</li>
<li><span id="mainEmphasis">Sensitive Data.</span> The collection, storage and use of sensitive data carries special obligations and responsibilities in order to maintain the data's security, integrity and privacy. Sensitive data will not be rented or made available for external distribution outside Steward or any of its affiliated or subsidiary operations, as applicable.</li>
</ol><p></p>

<h2 class="main">Information Steward Collects Automatically from You</h2>

<p>Steward collects no personally-identifiable information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide this information to us. However, we do collect and store certain other information automatically that does not identify you personally. We automatically collect:

</p><ul>
<li>The Internet domain. For example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain;</li>
<li>the Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer you are using whenever you access the Internet (e.g., 123.456.789.012), whether it is yours individually or provided as a proxy by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) through which you access our Web site;</li>
<li>the type of browser and operating system used to access our website;</li>
<li>the date and time you access our website;</li>
<li>the pages on our website that you accessed;</li>
<li>the address of a referring website (if you linked to our site from another website).</li>
</ul>

<p>We use this information in the form of summary statistics to help us make our website more useful to our clients, customers, and visitors, such as assessing what information is of most and least interest, and for other purposes such as determining the website's design specifications and identifying system performance or problem areas.</p> 
<p>This information is NOT shared with anyone except Steward and its affiliated and subsidiary operations, as applicable. </p>

<h2 class="main">Sending Steward Personal or Confidential Information</h2>
<p>If you choose to provide Steward with personally-identifiable information--by sending us an e-mail message or by filling out an online form and submitting it to us through our website--please be aware that we may use the information to improve our service to you, respond to your request, or send you relevant marketing and sales information. Your message could be saved in an electronic database or forwarded, in print or as e-mail, to others within Steward or its affiliated and subsidiary operations who may be better able to help you. Except, as required by law, we do not share our e-mails with outside organizations.</p> 
<p>Please note that e-mail is not secure from interception, so senders cannot expect total privacy. This also applies to sending online forms, unless the form is secure. If you would rather not submit information via email, you may wish to send it by traditional United States Postal Service mail or courier instead to the following address:</p> 

<p>
</p><address>
Mr. Robert E Jones, Vice President<br>
Steward Environmental Solutions, LLC<br>
2978 Lookout Place, NE<br>
Atlanta, GA 30305<br><br>
</address>
<p></p>
       
<p>You may also call Mr. Robert E. Jones at 404-264-4500 and ask to be referred to someone in Steward who may be able to answer your questions and provide you with instructions on how to submit your information.</p>
