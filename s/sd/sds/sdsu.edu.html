                        this information is collected, processed, maintained, protected, and disclosed. Unless
                        otherwise indicated on a specific Site, the California State University is the data

                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except as specifically described, our Sites are operated in accordance with the laws
                        of the United States. Please read this Notice carefully to understand our policies
                        and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. This Notice reflects
                        the University’s current practices and may change from time to time, so please check

                  <h4><strong>Personal Information we collect and process</strong></h4>
                  
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this Notice, “personal information” means any information that identifies or describes
                        an individual user of the Sites, including, but not limited to, the user’s name, social
                        security number, physical description, address, telephone number, education, financial
                        matters, medical or employment history, password, email address, and information that
                        reveals any network location or identity. If you are located in the European Economic
                        Area (EEA), “personal information” includes all personal data as defined under EEA
                        laws (including “sensitive personal information” which is provided enhanced protections
                        under those laws).</span></p>
                  
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect personal information about users only as allowed by law and limit the collection
                        of personal information to what is relevant and necessary to accomplish a lawful purpose
                        of the University. We collect personal information (and sensitive personal information)
                        that you send to the CSU, or permit us to obtain from third parties, for purposes
                        relevant to CSU operations in pursuit of our academic mission. Examples include information
                        needed for student admission (including financial aid information), employment, housing
                        and dining services, online educational programs, research, health services, donor
                        relations, visa application processing, event registration, parking services, IT usage
                        and support services, library usage, bookstore operations, and website account registrations.
                        Our legal basis for processing most of this information is to perform a task in the
                        public interest or in fulfillment of CSU official functions, including those set out
                        in the California Education Code and/or Title V of the California Code of Regulations,
                        or under applicable federal law. Other legal bases for processing information include
                        processing necessary for contract (e.g., to process parking permit payments), for
                        legitimate interests (e.g., to send requested information) or consent (e.g., to process
                        certain sensitive personal information).</span></p>
                  
                  <h4><strong>User-Provided Information</strong></h4>

                        why we collect it, and our legal basis for processing it, is periodically reassessed
                        in applicable data process flow assessments or Data Protection Impact Assessments,
                        as relevant.</span></p>
                  
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the policy of the California State University to limit the collection and safeguard
                        the privacy of personal information collected or maintained by the University. The
                        University’s information management practices conform to the requirements of the Information
                        Practices Act of 1977 (Civil Code Section 1798, et seq.), the Public Records Act (California
                        Government Code Section 6250, et seq.), California Government Code Section 11015.5,

                        99), and other applicable laws pertaining to information privacy. In the event of
                        a conflict between this Notice and the Public Records Act, the Information Practices
                        Act, FERPA, or other law governing the disclosure of University records, the applicable
                        law will control.</span></p>

                        to other countries such as the United States, where data protection laws may differ
                        from those of your home country. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge

                        on servers within the United States. However, all reasonable steps will be taken to

                        (for instance, any content you post) (“User Content”) becomes available to the public
                        via the Sites. User Content includes, but is not limited to, comments, photos, videos,
                        etc. If you remove User Content, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived
                        pages or if other users have copied or stored your User Content.</span></p>

                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies Information: When you visit the Sites, we may send one or more cookies – a
                        small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer
                        that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance
                        your navigation through the Sites. A cookie does not collect personal information
                        about you. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie
                        remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be
                        used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Sites. Persistent cookies can be
                        removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary
                        and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse
                        all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of
                        the Sites or services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is
                        disabled.</span></p>
                  
                  <h4><strong>Google Analytics</strong></h4>
                  
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use a tool called “Google Analytics,” a web analytics service provided by Google,
                        Inc. to collect information about use of the Sites. Google Analytics collects information
                        such as how often users visit our Sites, what pages are visited, and what other sites
                        were visited prior to coming to our Sites. We use the information we get from Google
                        Analytics only to improve the Sites. Google Analytics collects only the IP address
                        assigned to you on the date you visit the Sites, rather than your name or other identifying
                        information. Google Analytics will also collect contextual information, such as type
                        of web browser, type of operating system, browser resolution, and network location,
                        however we do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics
                        with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent
                        cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit
                        the Sites, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use
                        and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites
                        is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
                        You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the Sites
                        by disabling cookies on your browser, however, please note that if you do this you
                        may not be able to use the full functionality of the Sites.</span></p>
                  
                  <h4><strong>Log File Information</strong></h4>
                  
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access
                        a web page. When you register with or view our Sites, our servers automatically record
                        certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These
                        server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol addresses
                        or other device identifiers, browser information, Internet Service Provider, operating
                        system, location, date/time stamp, clickstream data, referring/exit pages and URLs,
                        domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</span></p>
                  
                  <h4><strong>Clear Gifs Information</strong></h4>
                  
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you use the Sites, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which
                        are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personal
                        information is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear
                        gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.</span></p>
                  
                  <h4><strong>California Do Not Track Disclosures</strong></h4>
                  
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January
                        1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator
                        responds to “Do Not Track” (DNT) browser settings. DNT is a feature offered by some
                        browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing
                        is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies.
                        We do not engage in the collection of personally identifiable information about users’
                        online activities over time and across third party websites when an individual uses
                        our Sites and therefore do not respond to DNT signals.</span></p>
                  
                  <h4><strong>How we share your information</strong></h4>
                  
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We share your information internally at the CSU to facilitate and manage the purposes
                        listed above, including with third parties whom the University engages to process
                        your personal information on our behalf for the purposes stated above (such as vendors
                        who help the University with our marketing, application processing, financial aid
                        or payment processing, education management, and web hosting). The University may
                        also share your personal data with government and law enforcement agencies or regulators
                        (1) to comply with a legal process, subpoena, order or other legal or regulatory requirement
                        applicable to us; (2) to enforce our terms of use or other policies; or (3) to pursue
                        available legal remedies or defend against legal claims. We may also share your personal
                        information with a third party as requested by you if permitted by this and other
                        University policies and applicable laws and regulations. We will not distribute or
                        share any electronically collected personal information (as defined in subdivision
                        (d) of California Government Code section 11015.5) about users to any third party
                        without prior written permission from the user except in narrow circumstances involving
                        possible violations of Section 502 of the Penal Code or as authorized under law (including
                        but not limited to the Information Practices Act), or to assist another state agency
                        or public law enforcement organization in any case where the security of a network
                        operated by a state agency has been, or is suspected of having been, breached.</span></p>
                  
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our
                        Sites or services for illegal activities. We may report to law enforcement agencies
                        any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. Release of your personal
                        information for security purposes, as described in this Notice to any person or entity,
                        including, without limitation, in connection with any government investigation or
                        litigation, shall be based on a determination made solely by us, as permitted by law
                        or, for those not in the EEA, exercising our discretion for which you expressly grant
                        permission to us in accordance with this Notice.</span></p>
                  
                  <h4><strong>How we protect your information</strong></h4>
                  
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We take reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the
                        integrity and security of your personal information against loss, unauthorized access,
                        and illegal use or disclosure. Such personal information is stored by the University
                        in secure locations and University staff is trained on procedures for the management
                        of personal information, including limitations on the release of information. Access
                        to personal information is limited to those members of the University’s staff whose
                        work requires such access. Confidential information is destroyed according to the
                        University’s records retention schedule. The University conducts periodic reviews
                        to ensure that proper information management policies and procedures are understood
                        and followed.</span></p>
                  
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The security of your personal information is important to us, but please remember
                        that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is
                        100% secure. While we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your
                        personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information
                        you transmit to the Sites, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission
                        of information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of
                        our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information
                        may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical,
                        technical, or managerial safeguards. While we strive to protect your personal information
                        and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online.</span></p>
                  
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We encourage all individuals to use appropriate safeguards to secure their computers
                        and the information on those computers. For additional information on online privacy
                        and security, please see the University’s policies and procedures related to Information
                        Security; you may also consult with the California Attorney General’s Privacy Enforcement

                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security,
                        we will promptly investigate and notify those persons whose personal information has
                        been compromised in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in the CSU
                        Information Security Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</span></p>

                        is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including

                        use other methods, such as U.S. mail, to respond to requests for information or to
                        communicate with us. You may use the contact information listed below to ask about
                        additional alternatives to providing or obtaining information through use of our Sites.</span></p>
                  
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By providing us your email address, you consent to our use of your email address to
                        send you Site and service-related notices, including any notices required by law,
                        in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send
                        you other messages, including, but not limited to, newsletters, information on campus
                        activities, programs and events, legal updates, changes to features of our Sites or
                        services, or other account information. Where required by law, we will obtain your
                        consent before sending you specific types of email or other communications.</span></p>
                  
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can choose not to receive such emails from us by “unsubscribing” using the instructions
                        in any email you receive from us, or by sending a written request to the postal or
                        email address set out below. It may take up to thirty (30) business days for us to
                        process your request. This will not stop us from sending emails about your account
                        or your transactions with us, or any other service-related email. Opting out does
                        not affect our communications with you via telephone or mail nor does it affect our
                        use of your non-personally identifiable information as described in this Notice.</span></p>
                  
                  <h4><strong>EEA Data Subject Rights</strong></h4>
                  
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are an individual located in the EEA only, you have certain rights with regard
                        to your personal data collected while you are in the EEA. These rights may include
                        right of access, right of correction, right to be forgotten, right to restrict processing
                        of your identifiable personal information, right to notice related to changes/deletion/processing
                        limits, right to data portability, right to objection, right not to be subject to
                        decisions based solely on automated processing, and right to withdraw consent. Some
                        of these rights are restricted by law to information that was collected on the basis
                        of explicit consent, or are restricted by other conditions (such as necessity for
                        contract or to comply with the law). You have the right to contact us in connection
                        with the exercise of your rights under applicable EEA law, which you can do through
                        the contact information below, or by sending an email to </span><a href="mailto:privacy@calstate.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">privacy@calstate.edu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We will respond to your written request without unreasonable delay and in accordance
                        with any deadlines imposed by law. Unless we notify you at the time of your request,
                        we will not charge you any fee in connection with the exercise of your rights. If
                        you are not satisfied with our response, you have the right to complain to or seek
                        advice from a supervisory authority and/or bring a claim against us in any court of
                        competent jurisdiction.</span></p>
