				government office and includes such items as an individual?s name, address, or phone number. We also collect 
				statistical information that helps us understand how people are using the web site so we can continually improve our 
				services. The information collected is not associated with any specific individual and no attempt is made to profile 
				individuals who browse the web site. You may be asked to participate in surveys at this site. Participation is 
				optional, and the choice to participate or not to participate will have no effect on your ability to use other 
				features of the site.

				designated in the survey.

				Records needed to support State program functions are retained, managed, and accessible in record-keeping or filing 
				systems in accordance with established records disposition authorizations approved by the State?s Public Records 
				Commission. Records transmitted to this site will be identified, managed, protected, and retained as long as they are 
				needed to meet historical, administrative, fiscal, or legal requirements.
