									<p class="f_size12">Founded in January 2000 by Panasonic, SanDisk and Toshiba, the SD Association is a group dedicated to establishing SD standards and facilitating their adoption and development.<br> At its outset the Association represented just 14 member companies and has grown into a global alliance comprised of around 1,000 member companies.
