									<p align="center"><b>Important Information Regarding Your Privacy and Security</b></p>
									<p>At San Diego County Credit Union, protecting the confidentiality of our members' and other consumers' assets and personal information is a priority.  We provide this Online Privacy Policy (the "Policy") to inform you of how we manage this responsibility. Our Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to provide quality products and services with the highest level of integrity.  We intend our Policy to be dynamic in response to ongoing changes in new technologies, business practices and member needs and we will update it, from time to time, as necessary.</p>
									<p>By using this web site (the "Site"), you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Policy. This Policy applies to users of the Site and we reserve the right to change this Policy, along with related procedures, at any time. </p>
									<p>This Policy is designed to assist you in understanding:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>What personally identifiable information of yours is collected; </li>
										<li>How your personally identifiable information is used; </li>
										<li>With whom your personally identifiable information may be shared; </li>
										<li>What choices are available to you regarding the collection, use and distribution of your personally identifiable information;</li>
										<li>The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your personally identifiable information under our control; and</li>
										<li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in your personally identifiable information.</li>
									</ul>
									<p><b>Information Collection</b><br>In order to service your account and better understand your financial needs, we collect your information at several different points on our Site.</p>
									<p>That information is compiled from the following sources:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Your registration to use different features on the Site;</li>
										<li>Surveys, applications and other forms filled by you;</li>
										<li>Various credit services;</li>
										<li>Use of cookies, as defined below, on the Site;</li>
										<li>Log files of the Site;</li>
										<li>Your transactions with us;</li>
										<li>Consumer reporting agencies; and</li>
										<li>Verifications of information you provide on an application or other forms. This may be obtained from your current or past employers or from other institutions where you conduct financial transactions.</li>
									</ul>
									<p><b>How Information Is Used</b><br>Although we are the sole owner of the information collected on this Site, we will not sell, rent or license to, or share with, others this information in any way different from what is disclosed in this Policy.  We use web site browser software tools such as cookies and web server logs to gather information about our Site users' browsing activities in order to constantly improve our Site and better serve our members. This information assists us to design and arrange our web pages in the most user-friendly manner and to continually improve our Site to better meet the needs of our members and prospective members. We may use these technologies to capture information about you. We also use Site log files and IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. We may keep personally identifiable information you provide to us, along with information we collect from outside sources, so that we can offer you accounts and services better tailored to your financial needs. The information you provide us through online surveys and promotions on the Site will be used for internal marketing purposes, as well as for the development of new services and information on the Site. This information will remain confidential and will not be sold to any nonaffiliated third party or to any affiliate.</p>
									<p>We provide many planning tools on the Site to assist you in financial planning. When you use various planning tools on the Site, we do not capture the personal information you provide when using these tools.</p>
									<p><b>With Whom Information May Be Shared</b><br>We do not disclose your nonpublic personal information to any nonaffiliated third party or to any affiliate except as permitted by law.  For example, we may share your nonpublic personal information as necessary to effect a transaction you request, or in connection with servicing or processing your account.  We may also share your nonpublic personal information with affiliated or nonaffiliated third parties in order for such other parties to perform business or professional services, such as printing, mailing services, data processing or analysis, or customer surveys, on our behalf or to otherwise assist us in processing transactions on your behalf, maintaining or servicing your account, fulfilling your service request or protecting the security of your financial records.  These companies are contractually restricted from disclosing the information received to other third parties and are not allowed to use your personally identifiable information except as necessary to carry out the purpose for which we disclosed such information.  We may provide aggregate information about our members, sales, Site traffic patterns and related Site information to reputable third parties, but this information will not include any nonpublic personal information. </p>
									<p>Our commitment to provide you with competitive products and services is also a promise to give you more financial service choices that may involve working with other companies. From time to time, you may notice offers from outside companies advertised on our Site.  We will not provide your nonpublic personal information to any such companies without your express permission, as required by law.</p>
									<p>If you terminate your membership with San Diego County Credit Union, we will not share information we have collected about you, except as may be permitted or required by law.</p>
									<p><b>Your Choices Regarding Collection, Use and Distribution Of Information </b><br>Occasionally, we may also use personally identifiable information that we collect to notify you about important changes to our Site, new services, and special offers we think you will find valuable. The lists used to send you product and service offers are developed and managed under our traditional corporate standards designed to safeguard the security and privacy of our members' personal information. If you desire not to receive these offers, please write to us at, San Diego County Credit Union, 6545 Sequence Drive, San Diego, California 92121. Or you may call us at (877) 732-2848.</p>
									<p><b>Security Procedures</b><br>The security of nonpublic personal information is very important to us and we take a number of steps to protect it. We limit access to personal and account information only to those San Diego County Credit Union employees who need to know that information in providing products and services to you. We maintain procedural, electronic, and physical safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information. We also require affiliates with whom we do business to maintain strong confidentiality practices.</p>
									<p>We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we collect from you. Cryptography scrambles information exchanged between your browser and our online banking server. Encryption happens as follows: when you enter and submit your account number and password for online banking, your browser establishes a secure session with our server. The secure session is established using a secure and industry standard protocol called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Encryption. This protocol requires the exchange of what are called public and private keys. Keys are random numbers chosen for that session known only between your browser and our server. After the keys are exchanged, your browser will use the numbers to scramble (encrypt) the messages sent between your browser and our server. Both sides require the keys because they need to descramble (decrypt) the messages when they are received. The SSL protocol is designed to not only ensure privacy but also to ensure that no other browser can "impersonate" your browser, nor alter any information sent. You can tell whether your browser is in secure mode by looking for the secured lock symbol at the bottom of your browser window. The numbers used as encryption keys are analogous to combination locks. The strength of encryption is based on the number of possible combinations that a lock can have. As the number of possible combinations grows, it becomes less likely that anyone would be able to guess the combination in order to decrypt the message.</p>
									<p>Most of today's browsers offer 128-bit encryption which results in a large number of possible combinations. Our servers are compatible with browsers that provide 40-bit encryption, although we recommend the use of 128-bit capable browsers. Click here to determine the level of encryption that your browser supports.</p>
									<p>We want you to use our Site with confidence, knowing that the information you submit to us is secure. To verify that a page on our Site is secure, position the arrow of your mouse over a portion of the page where there is not a graphic image. Right click on your mouse and select the option that provides properties or information about the page being viewed (Note: The option title will vary by browser).The properties or page information section will indicate the encryption strength being used to view the secure page.</p>
									<p>All online applications, forms and email on our Site are secure and feature a small graphic of a lock on the page. The encryption strength varies from 40 bit to 128 bit depending on the browser you are using.  You will also see a VeriSign graphic on pages in our Site with applications, forms and email links. VeriSign provides us with Internet trust services for secure electronic communications over IP networks. You may click on the graphic to verify that our secured site certificate is valid. VeriSign provides additional information about their services and security.</p>
									<p>Emails that you may send to us outside of our the sign-on page for online banking on our Site, may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information.  For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as Social Security or account numbers to us through an unsecured Email.  We provide a number of additional security features in online banking. Online banking will "timeout" after 15 minutes of inactivity. This prevents curious persons from continuing your home banking session in case you have left your PC unattended without logging out. Requests you make through the Internet are handled by our home banking server, which retrieves the information you request from our mainframe via proxy-based firewall servers. These servers act as the intermediary between you and our mainframe computers. When you submit your password, it is compared with the password we have stored in our secure data center. We allow you to enter your password incorrectly four times. If you enter your password incorrectly more than four times, your online banking account will be locked until you call us to reinitialize the account. We monitor and record "bad login" attempts to detect any suspicious activity, such as someone trying to guess your password. You play a crucial role in preventing others from logging on to your account.</p>
									<p>Never use passwords that are easy to guess. Examples of bad passwords are: birth dates, first names, pet names, addresses, phone numbers and Social Security numbers. Never reveal your password to another person or entity. You should periodically change your password in the Account Management section of Internet Branch.</p>
									<p>Our corporate values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed to the protection of member information. In general, our business practices limit employee access to confidential information, and limit the use and disclosure of such information only to authorized persons, processes and transactions.</p>
									<p><b>Correcting Inaccuracies</b><br>If your personally identifiable information changes (such as due to a change in your address), we will endeavor to provide a way to correct or update your personal data provided to us. These actions can usually be done in the Account Management section of Internet Branch. Alternatively, you can write to us at, San Diego County Credit Union, 6545 Sequence Drive, San Diego, California 92121. Or you may call us at (877) 732-2848.</p>
									<p><b>Cookies</b><br>"Cookies" are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a web site. They are small pieces of data that are stored on a user's computer by their web browser. Persistent cookies are stored on the computer's hard drive and are accessible until they expire or are manually deleted.  Session cookies are temporary and are stored in the computer's memory until the web browser is closed. Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include information such as the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at the Site, and the web sites visited just before and just after our Site. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from web page to web page and to complete transactions over the Internet. You are not obligated to accept a cookie from our Site, or any other web site, and may modify your browser so that it will not accept cookies at your discretion. We require you to accept session cookies in order to be authenticated when banking online. If you are unsure how to turn cookies off on your browser, please check the "help" feature on your browser or email our Technical Support Department. Some of our associated companies may themselves use cookies on their own web sites. We have no access to, or control of these cookies, should this occur. When you use various planning tools on the site, we do not capture the personal information you provide using these tools.</p>
									<p><b>Links</b><br>We are not responsible for practices employed by web sites of other companies linked to from our Site, nor the information or content contained therein. We cannot, and do not, make any representations about the practices and policies of these companies, and are not responsible in any way for how these companies use cookies or any information you provide to them.  This remains true even where the linked site appears within the parameters or window/frame of our Site. Often links to other web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to users of our Site.</p>
									<p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Site to another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other web site, including web sites which have a link to our Site, is subject to that web site's own rules and policies. Please read these rules and policies before proceeding.</p>
									<p><b>Notification of Changes</b><br>If we decide to change this Policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so that Site users are kept aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email. Users will have a choice as to whether to permit us to use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy operating at the time the information was collected.</p>
									<p><b>Children's Privacy</b><br>Our Site is not intended for use by children. We do not knowingly market to, nor solicit data from, children. <a style="padding: 0; margin: 0;" href="legaldisclosure.asp">Click here</a> for further information on terms governing use of this Site.</p>
