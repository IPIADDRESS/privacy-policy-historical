In such an event, SDC.com will be able to restore data for Users.<br> Various data storage systems and backups have different lifecycle policies which are held for a maximum of 90 days. For example, our database backups are encrypted, incremental and full re-cycle in 30 days. It is impossible to erase User data inside encrypted incremental backups in real-time.<br> SDC.com may also retain some of the User data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies any specific Users, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about any Users. &nbsp; The information you share on the Services:&nbsp;If User’s account is deactivated or disabled, some of the User information and the content that Users have provided will remain in order to allow other members or other Users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display comments and content you provided to forums.

However, such requests can only be fulfilled if the data in question is: 1) provided by the data subject to SDC.com, 2) is processed automatically and 3) is processed based on consent or fulfilment of a contract.<br> • If the data is being used to make automated decisions about the data subject, to be told what logic the system uses to make those decisions and to be able to request human intervention. <br> SDC.com must provide a response to data subjects requesting access to their data within 30 calendar days of receiving the Data Subject Access Request unless local legislation dictates otherwise.

The Data Subject Access Request provides the right for data subjects to see or view their own personal data as well as to request copies of the data. <br> A Data Subject Access Request must be made in writing. In general, verbal requests for information held about an individual are not valid DSARs. In the event a formal Data Subject Access Request is made verbally to a staff member of the Company, further guidance should be sought from Data Protection Officer, who will consider and approve all Data Subject Access Request applications. <br> A Data Subject Access Request can only be made via any of the following methods: email, post, or corporate website. DSARs made online must be treated like any other Data Subject Access Requests when they are received, though the Company will not provide personal information via social media channels.<br>  <strong>Requirements for a valid DSAR</strong><br> In order to be able to respond to the Data Subject Access Requests in a timely manner, the data subject should:<br> • Submit his/her request using a Data Subject Access Request Form.<br> • Provide SDC.com with sufficient information to validate his/her identity (to ensure that the person requesting the information is the data subject or his/her authorized person).<br> Subject to the exemptions referred to in this document, SDC.com will provide information to data subjects whose requests are in writing (or by some other method explicitly permitted by the local law), and are received from an individual whose identity can be validated by SDC.com.  Requests are more likely to be successful where they are specific and targeted at particular information.<br> Factors that can assist in narrowing the scope of a search include identifying the likely holder of the information (e.g. by making reference to a specific department), the time period in which the information was generated or processed (the narrower the time frame, the more likely a request is to succeed) and being specific about the nature of the data sought (e.g. a copy of a particular form or email records from within a particular department).<br><br>  <strong>Exemptions</strong><br> An individual does not have the right to access information recorded about someone else, unless they are an authorized representative, or have parental responsibility. <br> SDC.com is not required to respond to requests for information unless it is provided with sufficient details to enable the location of the information to be identified, and to satisfy itself as to the identity of the data subject making the request. <br> In principle, SDC.com will not normally disclose the following types of information in response to a Data Subject Access Request: • Information about other people – A Data Subject Access Request may cover information which relates to an individual or individuals other than the data subject. Access to such data will not be granted, unless the individuals involved have previously given consent to the disclosure of their data in one of the scenarios detailed above, such as communications from other users.<br> • Repeat requests – Where a similar or identical request in relation to the same data subject has previously been complied with within a reasonable time period, and where there is no significant change in personal data held in relation to that data subject, any further request made within a three month period of the original request will be considered a repeat request, and SDC.com will not normally provide a further copy of the same data<br> • Publicly available information – The Company is not required to provide copies of documents which are already in the public domain, such as stories, forum contributions, and other User generated content.<br> • Opinions given in confidence or protected by copyright law – SDC.com does not have to disclose personal data held in relation to a data subject that is in the form of an opinion given in confidence or protected by copyright law.<br> • Privileged documents – Any privileged information held by SDC.com need not be disclosed in response to a DSAR. In general, privileged information includes any document which is confidential (e.g. a direct communication between a client and his/her lawyer) and is created for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice.<br><br>  <strong>Data Subject Access Request Refusals </strong><br> There are situations where individuals do not have a right to see information relating to them. For instance: • If the information is kept only for the purpose of statistics or research, and where the results of the statistical work or research are not made available in a form that identifies any of the individuals involved.<br> • Requests made for other, non-data protection purposes can be rejected.<br> If the responsible person refuses a Data Subject Access Request on behalf SDC.com, the reasons for the rejection must be clearly set out in writing. Any individual dissatisfied with the outcome of his/her Data Subject Access Request is entitled to make a request to the Data Protection Officer to review the outcome.  <br><br>  <strong>No Guarantees for Factors Beyond SDC’s Control</strong><br>  While this Privacy Statement expresses SDC's standards for maintenance of private data, it is not in a position to guarantee that the standards will always be met. There may be factors beyond SDC's control (e.g., "script kiddies, crackers and other malcontents, hurricanes, tornados, acts of God, loss of power, diseases, loss of mind, body and soul") that may result in disclosure of data. As a consequence, SDC disclaims any warranties or representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure of private information.&nbsp;             </div>
