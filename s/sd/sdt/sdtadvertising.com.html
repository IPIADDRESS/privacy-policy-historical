<p><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">SDTadvertising.com strives to offer its 
visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an 
interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable 
Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) 
subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent 
your email address to any unauthorized third party. Period."</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">How we gather information from 
users</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">How we collect and store information 
depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to 
participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide 
information when you register for access to certain portions of our site or 
request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You 
may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, 
message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like 
most Web sites, SDTadvertising.com also collects information automatically and 
through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For 
example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie 
technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other 
things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from 
having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the 
number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our 
site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through 
other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with 
information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, 
but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be 
asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to 
customize the siteâ€™s features according to your preferences.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">What we do with the information we 
collect</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">Like other Web publishers, we collect 
information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and 
advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with 
anyone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">Aggregated Information (information 
that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we 
may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information 
obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn 
which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated 
Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business 
partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable 
Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">We may use Personally Identifiable 
Information collected on SDTadvertising.com to communicate with you about your 
registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy 
policy; services and products offered by SDTadvertising.com and other topics we 
think you might find of interest. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">Personally Identifiable Information 
collected by SDTadvertising.com may also be used for other purposes, including 
but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of 
e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other 
communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for 
the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such 
information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, 
from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, 
merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user 
information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your 
information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are 
reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of 
amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we 
deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice 
prior to disclosure in such cases.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">Affiliated sites, linked sites and 
advertisements</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">SDTadvertising.com expects its 
partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be 
aware, however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, 
affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have 
their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, 
during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a 
SDTadvertising.com page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a 
third party. Also, through SDTadvertising.com you may be introduced to, or be 
able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes 
offered by other parties. SDTadvertising.com is not responsible for the actions 
or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy 
policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page 
operated by a third party.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">While on our site, our advertisers, 
promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology 
to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about 
you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may 
include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a 
particular advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer 
services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to 
gather information. SDTadvertising.com does not control the use of this 
technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible 
for any actions or policies of such third parties.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">You should also be aware that if you 
voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in 
chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and 
used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited 
messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the 
control of SDTadvertising.com and this policy.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">Children</font></b></p>
