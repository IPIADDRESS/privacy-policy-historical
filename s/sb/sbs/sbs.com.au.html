          <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SBS takes the 
            privacy of users of its Websites seriously and seeks to comply with 
            all elements of the <i>Privacy Act 1988</i> ("the Act") 
            in its on-line conduct.<br>

          <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you visit 
            this website, our internet service provider makes a record of the 
            visits and logs the following information for statistical purposes 
            — the user’s server address, the user’s top-level domain 
            name (eg: .com, .gov, .au etc.), the date and time of visit to the 
            site, the pages accessed and documents downloaded, the previous site 
            visited and the type of browser used. No attempt will be made to identify 
            users or their browsing activities except, as required by a law enforcement 
            agency exercising a warrant to inspect the service provider’s 
            logs.<br>

          <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SBS makes use 
            of "cookies" to enhance the functionality of this website. 
            However, cookies are not used to record any personal information (eg:

            record your e-mail address or other personal details if you send us 
            a message (eg: in entering a competition or viewer feedback etc.). 
            It will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it 
            to SBS and will not be added to a mailing list unless you have consented 
            to this. We will not use your e-mail address for any other purpose

            personal information submitted to that website may be recorded by 
            either SBS or the SBS Partner. However, SBS imposes contractual restrictions 
            equivalent to those imposed on SBS by the Act in respect of collection 
            and use of personal information by such third parties.<br>
