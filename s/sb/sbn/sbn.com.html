                    you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information

                    such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering

                    in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications
                    will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already
                    provided your information to a third party (such as an event provider) before you
                    have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change
                    your preferences directly with that third party.</li>

                <b>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
                We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural
                measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and
                disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal
                information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition,
                we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your
                personal information.<br>
                We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no
                system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your
                information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information,
                searches, or other communications would always remain secure. Users should also
                take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should
                avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal
                Trade Commission's Website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for
                information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.<br>

                and others and communicate with others, as well as post reviews of businesses, products,
                establishments, contractors, and the like, or upload content (e.g. pictures, videos,
                audio files, etc.). Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use. In addition,
                such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the
                subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information
                on publicly viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and
                can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address,
                you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or
                what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage
                you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your Personal information.
