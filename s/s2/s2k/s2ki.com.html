<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h2>

<p>This policy covers how S2KI treats personal information that
S2KI collects and receives, including information related to your past use of
S2KI products and services. Personal information is information about you that
is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone
number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.</p>

<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies
that S2KI does not own or control, or to people that S2KI does not employ or
manage.</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>S2KI collects personal information when you register with
S2KI, when you use S2KI products or services, when you visit S2KI pages or the
pages of certain S2KI partners, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes.
S2KI may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain
from business partners or other companies.</p>

<p>When you register we ask for information such as your name,
email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal
interests. Once you register with S2KI and sign in to our services, you are not
anonymous to us.</p>

<p>S2KI collects information about your transactions with us
and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of
services that we offer.</p>

<p>S2KI automatically receives and records information on our
server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information,
and the page you request.</p>

<p>S2KI uses information for the following general purposes: to
customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for
products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and
provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>S2KI does not accept or permit registration to children
under the age of 16 and collects no personal information from or about
children.</p>

<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

<p>S2KI does not rent, sell, or share personal information
about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide
products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under
the following circumstances:</p>

<ol>
 <li>We
     provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with
     S2KI under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your
     personal information to help S2KI communicate with you about offers from
     S2KI and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any
     independent right to share this information.</li>
 <li>We
     respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or
     exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;</li>
 <li>We
     believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate,
     prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,
     situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any
     person, violations of S2KIÕs terms of service, or as otherwise required by
     law.</li>
 <li>We
     transfer information about you if S2KI is acquired by or merged with
     another company. In this event, S2KI will notify you before information
     about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy
     policy.</li>
 <li>S2KI
     displays targeted advertisements based on personal information.
     Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who
     interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria
     - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.</li>
</ol>

<p>S2KI does not provide any personal information to the
advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by
interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that
the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria
used to display the ad.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>S2KI may set and access S2KI cookies on your computer.
Cookie information is used to establish and maintain your S2KI session,
maintain preferences and store state information used to properly present the
S2KI website.</p>

<p>S2KI may share this information with internal and external
partners for the purpose of providing S2KI services.</p>

<h2>Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences</h2>

<p>You can edit your S2KI Account Information, including your
marketing preferences at any time.</p>

<p>New categories of marketing communications may be added to
the Profile Preferences page from time to time. Users who visit this page can
opt out of receiving future marketing communications from these new categories
or they can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages
they receive.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to send you certain communications
relating to the S2KI service, such as service announcements and administrative
messages that are considered part of your S2KI account, without offering you
the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.</p>

<p>You can delete your S2KI account. You can request your
account be deleted by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@s2ki.com">info@s2ki.com</a>.
</p>

<h2>Confidentiality and Security </h2>

<p>We limit access to personal information about you to
employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that
information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their
jobs.</p>

<p>We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to
protect personal information about you.</p>

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>S2KI may update this policy. We will notify you about
significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a
notice to the primary email address specified in your S2KI account or by
placing a prominent notice on our site.</p>

<h2>Questions and Suggestions </h2>

<p>We welcome your questions and suggestions. If you have
questions or suggestions regarding our Privacy Policy please contact:</p>
