                            1. We collect only information that is essential to 
                            providing optimal service to customers <br>
                            and users. Acquired information is strictly limited 
                            to what we need to know in order to provide optimal 
                            service levels to our customers and to fulfill all 
                            legal or regulatory requirements. <br>
                            2. We inform users about what data is collected and 
                            how it will be used. Our customers are fully informed 
                            about the general uses we make of collected information 
                            and we will provide additional information upon request. 
                            We do not sell, lease or license confidential information 
                            to outside parties. We provide access to confidential 
                            information only to outside parties who are directly 
                            related to the delivery and service of our products 
                            and services. Information retrieval is fully disclosed 
                            to all authorized parties.<br>
                            3. Our customers choose how their self-disclosed data 
                            will be used. We allow SSL business customers to decide 
                            how they want the information they disclose to be 
                            used. Opting out of information disclosure is available 
                            at any time.<br>
                            4. We ensure information quality. We employ advanced 
                            technologies, well-defined practices, and a highly 
                            trained technical staff to ensure that self-disclosed 
                            data is processed properly, accurately and completely. 
                            We provide the mechanism for self-disclosed data to 
                            be corrected if errors or changes occur. We do not 
                            guarantee the accuracy of third party data we license 
                            to use in the SSL Secured™ identity seal, but 
                            we do facilitate the process of resolving any data 
                            discrepancies. <br>
                            5. We use information security safeguards. We use 
                            advanced information security technologies and a highly 
                            trained technical staff to protect all data assets 
                            entrusted to us. We have implemented well-defined 
                            data security and data access procedures to further 
                            ensure that data is protected from improper access, 
                            loss, misuse or destruction.<br>
                            6. We are responsive to requests for explanation about 
                            our data use and policies. Our Customer Service Representatives 
                            are trained to be responsive to queries about our 
                            policies, practices, products and services. Customer 
                            Service Representatives are also trained to facilitate 
                            the process of resolving any data discrepancies in 
                            third party data. <br>
                            7. We hold our employees responsible for our privacy 
                            principles. Each SSL employee is personally responsible 
                            for helping to maintain public confidence in the company. 
                            All SSL employees are provided with training in the 
                            protection of data privacy and security practices, 
                            which are also included in the SSL employee handbook. 
                            <br>
                            8. We provide these privacy principles to our business 
                            partners. We strongly encourage companies we select 
                            as our business partners to have privacy policies 
                            based upon accepted industry standards in the handling 
                            of self-disclosed data. These include companies that 
                            assist us in providing service to our customers or 
                            supply us with information about enterprises or individuals. 
                            During the business partner selection process, SSL 
                            scrutinizes the accuracy and quality of the data candidates, 
                            as well as their information handling practices. We 
                            do not guarantee the accuracy of third party data 
                            we license to use in the SSL Secured™ identity 
                            seal, but do facilitate the process of resolving any 
                            data discrepancies.<br>
                            9. We comply with all applicable privacy laws and 
                            regulations wherever SSL does business, based upon 
                            the prevailing jurisdictional requirements. As a company 
                            with a global reach, SSL is committed to remaining 
                            current with the requirements of all local, national 
                            and international laws and regulations applicable 
                            to our products and services. <br>
                            10. We undergo regularly scheduled audits of our privacy 
                            policies and practices to monitor our compliance with 
                            our stated policies.</font></p>
