    <p>
        If you require any more information or have any questions about our privacy policy, please feel free to contact
        us.
        <a href="https://www.ssavr.com/contact">Click here to contact us.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        We consider the privacy of our visitors and users to be extremely important. This privacy policy describes in
        detail the types of personal information is collected and recorded by us and how we use it.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Log Files</h3>
    <p>
        Like many other Web sites, we make use of log files. These files merely logs visitors to the site - usually a
        standard procedure for hosting companies and a part of hosting services' analytics. The information inside the
        log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time
        stamp, referring/exit pages and user agent. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site,
        track user's movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses, and other such
        information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
    <p> By using Simple.Savr, you understand that we do not have any text you typed saved in plain copy saved in
        database. It is encrypted using the encryption text provided by you. If no encryption text was provided, it is
        encrypted using the default encryption text which is randomly generated. Any information typed in the text is
        instantly saved in database (and is encrypted) and deleted instantly as soon as it is removed from the text box.
        We log the text using IP addresses so that we can display them to all of your devices. The text you type in the
        text box is not, in any form or method, shared with anyone.
    </p>
    <p> We also allow you to upload files to our service that is automatically synced to all your added IPs. Your
        uploaded files are stored on our servers which can be deleted by anyone who is under your added IP address. This
        action can be protected by setting up a password. Your uploaded files are automatically deleted every 7 days to
        protect your files.
    </p>
    <p> In addition to uploading files, you are also able to compress and download all your uploaded files at once for
        convenience. The compressed file is automatically deleted after it has been downloaded. If our server is under
        heavy load and the compressed file is not deleted immediately after being downloaded, it will be automatically
        deleted before within 24 hours as a result of daily server cleanups.
    </p>
    
    <p> You have the ability to set a password for your savr, which prevents anyone else from viewing your savr without
        the correct password. Your savr will not be decrypted without the password, if password is enabled. If no
        password is enabled, you understand that anyone who is under your IP address is able to view and edit your savr.
    </p>
    <p> We give you an option to add and link multiple IP Addresses so that multiple IPs can view, create, edit and
        delete your savr, in addition to upload, download and delete files. If you have added additional IPs to your IP,
        you understand that anyone who is under the added IP can edit, view, delete your savr and uploaded files.
    </p>
    <h3>Destroy Information</h3>
    <p> Unlike other services, we allow you to destroy and permanently <a href="https://www.ssavr.com/debug">delete</a>
        all information that we have stored about you, which includes your IP address, savr, uploaded files, user agent
        and referring/exit pages. After your delete your information, it will be deleted instantly from our servers.
        However, our backup system may still have your information which will be automatically deleted within 60 days.
    </p>

    <p> We use cookies to store information about our visitor's preferences, to record user-specific information on
        which pages the site visitor accesses or visits, and to personalize or customize our web page content based upon
