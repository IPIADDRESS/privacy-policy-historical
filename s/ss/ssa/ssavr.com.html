    <p>
        If you require any more information or have any questions about our privacy policy, please feel free to contact
        us.
        <a href="/contact">Click here to contact us.</a>
        <br>
        We consider the privacy of our visitors and users to be extremely important. This privacy policy describes in
        detail the types of personal information is collected and recorded by us and how we use it.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Log Files</b>
        <br>
        Like many other Web sites, we make use of log files. These files merely logs visitors to the site - usually a
        standard procedure for hosting companies and a part of hosting services' analytics. The information inside the
        log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time
        stamp, referring/exit pages and user agent. This information is used to analyze trends,
        administer the site, track user's movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses,
        and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Information You Provide</b>
        <br>
        By using Simple.Savr, you understand that we do not have any text you typed saved in plain copy saved in
        database. It is encrypted using the encryption text provided by you. If no encryption text was provided, it is
        encrypted using the default encryption text which is randomly generated. Any information typed in the text is
        instantly saved in database (and is encrypted) and deleted instantly as soon as it is removed from the text box.
        We log the text using IP addresses so that we can display them to all of your computers. The text you type in
        the text box is not, in any form or method, shared with anyone.

        <br>

        We allow you to upload files to our service that is automatically synced to all your added IP's. Your uploaded
        files are stored on our servers which can be deleted by anyone who is under your added IP address. This action
        can be protected by setting up a passphrase.
        <br>
        You have the ability to set a passphrase for
        your savr, which prevents anyone else from viewing your savr without the correct passphrase. Your savr will not
        be decrypted without the passphrase, if passphrase is enabled.

        If no passphrase is enabled, anyone who is under your IP address is able to view and edit your savr.
        <br>
        We give you an option to add and link multiple IP Addresses so that multiple IP's can view, create, edit and
        delete your savr. If you have added additional IP's to your IP, you understand that anyone who is under the
        added IP can edit, view, delete your savr and uploaded files.

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Destroy Information</b>
        <br>
        Unlike other services, we allow you to destroy and permanently
        <a href="/debug">delete</a>
        all information that we have stored about you, which includes
        your IP address, savr, uploaded files, user agent and referring/exit pages. After your delete your information,
        it will be deleted instantly from our servers. However, our backup system may still have your information which
        will be automatically deleted within 60 days.
