                            <div tabindex="-1">
                                <p>In order to optimize your experience and provide statistically accurate data about how you use our web site, we use web measurement and customization technologies.&nbsp; These technologies are commonly known as โcookies,โ but may include other technologies.&nbsp; We have no plans to implement any other such technology, but will continually review any potential future uses of cookies or other technologies and revise this policy as needed.
                                </p>
                                <p>When we use such technologies, a small piece of text is sent to your computer along with the web page when you visit a site.&nbsp; No other web site can access the cookie we set; your computer will share the information in the cookie only with the computer that sent it. </p>
                                <p>There are three โtiersโ of these web measurement and customization technologies, as established by the Office of Management and Budget:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Tier 1</strong> โ Single session. This technology โremembersโ the online interactions within a single session or visit to a single web site; they let our server know that a person is continuing a visit to our site and connect the personโs activities for analysis. Any information related to a particular visit to the web site is deleted from the personโs computer immediately after the session ends.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Tier 2</strong> โ Multi-session without personally identifiable information (PII).&nbsp; This type of technology&nbsp; notices when a person returns to a web site and remembers his or her online interactions and preferences across multiple sessions, typically for the purpose of web analytics, but also for customizing peopleโs online experience. </li>
                                    <li><strong>Tier 3</strong> โ Multi-session with PII.&nbsp; This type of cookie is the same as Tier 2, but back-end web site programming ties it to peopleโs PII. <em>We do not, and have no plan to</em>, use Tier 3 cookies. </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>1.&nbsp; The purpose of the web  measurement and customization technology </strong></p>
                                <p>We can provide a better experience for you if we understand how you use the site.&nbsp; To this end, we use Tier 1 technology when you transact business on line with us, such as applying for benefits or changing your address.&nbsp; We store this โsession cookieโ on your computer only during your visit.&nbsp; The session cookie keeps you and us from losing information you have entered during a business transaction with us.&nbsp;Once you exit our application, your computer deletes the cookie from your computer. When you partially complete one of our on-line applications, we provide you with a secure means of returning to your application that does not use any web measurement technology.</p>
                                <p>We use Tier 2 technology to help us analyze site use by identifying you as a new or returning visitor; this does nothing other than distinguish whether you have been to our site before.&nbsp; Our web measurement applications compare the behavior of new and returning visitors in the aggregate to help us identify work flows and trends and also resolve common problems on our site. We do not use this technology to identify you or any other person.</p>
                                <p>We use Tier 2 web measurement technology to improve our website and provide a better user experience for our customers. This technology anonymously tracks how visitors interact with socialsecurity.gov, including where they came from, what they did on the site, and whether they completed any pre-determined tasks while on the site.</p>
                                <p>This technology is provided by Google Analytics and the information collected is used to optimize our website; helping us determine top tasks, improve our user interface and diversify our content offerings to meet the needs of our customers. No personally identifiable information is collected, so the anonymity of the end user is protected.&nbsp; The measurement data that is collected is only retained for as long as is needed for proper analysis and optimization of the website and is accessible only to employees whose position necessitates it.</p>
                                <!-- next two paragraphs added 04/10/14 -->
                                <p>The Social Security Administration also uses Tier 2 technology to obtain feedback and data on visitorsโ satisfaction with the SSA website. To accomplish this, SSA participates in a government-wide relationship with ForeSee Results, which provides an array of survey tools as part of its American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI). The ACSI survey is a mix of unique features and tools, including cxReplay (formerly Session Replay), which provides federal agencies with an assessment of the experiences of their web visitors. The ACSI survey does not collect PII. Participation in the AC SI survey is entirely voluntary. Visitors who decline the survey invitation enjoy full access to the identical information and resources on the SSA website as those who take the survey. Answers to the ACSI help SSA improve and evolve its website to make it easier to use and more responsive to the needs of SSA visitors.</p>
                                <p>The ACSI staff conducts analyses and reports on the aggregated data from the ACSI survey. The reports are only available to SSA website managers, members of the SSA communications and web teams, and others who require user feedback to perform their duties. The SSA retains the data only as long as required by law or needed to support the mission of the SSA website.

                                <p>Since disabling this web measurement technology requires modifying individual browser settings it is enabled by default. If you wish to opt-out, you can find step-by-step instructions for changing your settings at <a class="break-line" href="http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml">http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml</a>.

                                <p>We also use Tier 2 technology on our Open Government page hosted by IdeaScale to make your login easier, prevent anonymous abuse of the service, and ensure fair voting. We also maintain pages on Facebook and YouTube, both of which use Tier 2 technology. We will update our policy as necessary should we extend our use of these technologies in other similar services.</p>
                                <p>In the future, we plan to make it possible for you to customize your online experience with us by saving your website preferences. &nbsp;While we are not presently offering such an option, Tier 2 technology is the usual way of providing for such a service.</p>
                                <p><strong>2. The usage Tier, session type, and technology used </strong></p>
                                <p>We implement Tier 1 (Single session) and Tier 2 (Multi-session without PII) technologies using the text-based โcookieโ technology. </p>
                                <p><strong>3. The nature of the information collected </strong></p>

                                <p><strong>6.&nbsp; The privacy safeguards  applied to the information </strong></p>
                                <p>We will comply with all applicable statutes and policies in regards to protecting the privacy and security of information we collect using a web measurement or customization technology.&nbsp; A listing of Privacy Impact Assessments for our electronic systems and collections, including those utilizing web measurement and customization technologies, are located at <a class="break-line" href="https://www.ssa.gov/foia/html/pia.htm">https://www.ssa.gov/foia/html/pia.htm</a></p>
                                <p><strong>7.&nbsp; The data retention policy for  the information </strong></p>
                                <p>We will retain data the technology makes available only as long as required by law, or specific program need as specified by the National Archives and Records Administrationโs General Records Schedule 20, which pertains to Electronic Records or other approved records schedule as applicable.</p>
                                <p><strong>8.&nbsp; Whether we enable the  technology by default or not and why </strong></p>

                                    <br>
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>10.&nbsp; Statement that opting-out  still permits users to access comparable information or services </strong></p>

                                <p><strong>11.&nbsp; The identities of all  third-party vendors involved in the measurement and customization process </strong></p>
                                <p>We currently use Tier 2 technology on our Open Government page hosted by IdeaScale, as well as on our YouTube and Facebook pages. There are a number of Tier 1 technologies used by SSA. WebTrends is a web-based reporting tool for our internet and intranet applications and informational pages activities. Our WebTrends data collection is purely internal to SSAโs computers; the data collected is not shared with, or stored on, WebTrendsโ servers. WebSphere is a similar tool that tracks a userโs session within an application.&nbsp; Tivoli is an application that keeps track of the authenticated user and maintains a userโs session on the firewall. Some third party social media sites we use may utilize web measurement and customization technologies, however these technologies are not used on behalf of SSA, and are solely used for the third partyโs own purposes. In addition, some pages on SSA.gov may include web content or functionality from third parties, such as embedded videos hosted by non-SSA.gov services.</p>
