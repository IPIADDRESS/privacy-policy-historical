                  in the cookie only to the computer that sent it, and no other
                  website can request it. There are three types of cookies--persistent,
                  third party, and session. We never used persistent or third
                party cookies, but sometimes we use session cookies.

                  your visit, and we’ll tell you in advance when we do.
                  The session cookie keeps you from losing information you’ve
                  entered for a business transaction with us if, during your
