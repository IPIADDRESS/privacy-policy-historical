            <h1>FirstBank Privacy Policy and Disclosure</h1>
            <p>FirstBank 
        is committed to maintaining the privacy of our customers. We have policies 
        and procedures in place to restrict access to nonpublic personal information 
        to employees who need to know that information to provide products or 
        services to our customers. In addition, we maintain physical, electronic, 
        and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard 
        customers' nonpublic personal information. </p>
            <p>We maintain appropriate security standards and procedures in order 
              to protect our customers' information and prevent unauthorized access. 
              We have implemented commercially reasonable security procedures 
              for our Internet Banking Service. More information about the security 
              procedures for the Internet Banking Service is available <a href="internetbanking/security.html">here</a>. 
            </p>
      <p>In regard to Internet 
        usage, cookies are pieces of data assigned by a Web server to the browser 
        on a specific PC. Cookies help web sites recognize return visitors, and 
        cannot be read by a web site other than the one that set the cookie. When 
        someone returns to a web site he or she has visited before, the person's 
        browser gives this data back to the server. </p>
            <p>FirstBank only uses cookies to track web site and Internet Banking 
              usage, such as number of hits, pages visited, and the length of 
              user sessions, in order to evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness 
              of our site and service. We do not gather any information to personally 
              identify visitors, and none will contain information that will enable 
              someone to contact visitors via telephone, e-mail, or any other 
              means. </p>
            <p>Users have the option to set their browsers to notify them before 
              receiving a cookie, which allows them to decide whether or not to 
              accept it. In addition, browsers can also be set to turn off cookies 
              entirely. However, cookies are required to access FirstBank's Internet 
              Banking Service, so turning cookies off will prevent access to this 
              service. Cookies are not required to access FirstBank's web site.</p>
      <p>We are not responsible 
        for the information collection practices of third party web sites that 
        are linked with FirstBank's web site. In addition, we cannot guarantee 
        how these third parties use cookies or whether they place or add computer 
        cookies that may identify visitors personally. We recommend and encourage 
        users to review Privacy Policies carefully before providing personal information 
        on any of these web sites.</p>

      <p>We have implemented 
        commercially reasonable security systems to protect personal information 
        that we receive from any of our online applications. All information that 
        is sent to us on these applications is encrypted using the standard security 
        protocol Secure Socket Layer (SSL) during the transmission from an applicant's 
        personal computer. Once an application for a loan or new account has been 
        submitted, applicants are not able to view or update the information online, 
        but may call FirstBank's Loans by Phone Department at 303-238-5522 or 
        1-800-964-3444 outside Metro Denver for information regarding applications. 
        </p>
            <p>For Internet Banking enrollment, once the customer has been enrolled 
              for Internet Banking, he or she may view and update certain user 
              information by logging into Internet Banking and going to the Personalization 
              section. Customers may also call an Internet Banking Representative 
              at 303-232-5522 or 1-800-964-3444 outside Metro Denver.</p>
      <p>While visitors can 
        use e-mail to contact us about routine issues and inquiries, e-mail may 
        not be a secure method of communication for time sensitive communication 
        or communication of information that is confidential. We strongly recommend 
        that this type of information not be communicated via e-mail. </p>
      </a><p><a name="ssl">From our web site, 
        we do not knowingly collect or use personal information from children
         under 14 years of age. We are not responsible for the data collection
        
        and use practices of nonaffiliated third parties to which our web sites
         may link. For more information about the Children's Online Privacy Protection

      <p>Our privacy policy 
        is posted on our web site and is also available at any of our offices
        or by telephoning us. We do not sell any information about customers
        to
        third parties for marketing or other commercial purposes, and we train
        our employees to protect the confidentiality of customer records. In
        order
        to be certain that information is not provided to someone pretending
        to be one of our customers, we will establish security procedures from
        time
        to time to confirm customer identity. These procedures may consist of
        the use of passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs) whenever
        customers request information or services at any of our locations or
        by
        telephone. Customers must take reasonable precautions to maintain the
        confidentiality of any passwords or PINs that are selected or received
        from us. We will not be responsible for any losses or damages if customer
        actions or inactions contribute to someone else gaining access to his
        or her password.</p>
      <p>In the course of providing 
        our products and services, we collect nonpublic personal information about 
        customers from the following sources: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information we receive 
            from you on  applications or other forms, such as your name, address,
          and phone number;</li>
        <li>            Information about your transactions with us and our affiliates,
          such as your account activity, payment history, and account balances; </li>
        <li>            Information we receive from consumer reporting agencies,
          such as your credit report;</li>
        <li>Information we receive from other third parties, such as your employer
          when verifying information provided by you on our applications.</li>
        </ul>      
      <p>              We may disclose nonpublic personal information, as described
        above, about our customers and former customers to any FirstBank affiliate.
                    We will
                      only disclose information to nonaffiliated third parties
                as permitted by law. We periodically
                      enter into agreements with third party insurance providers
                  to provide additional financial services to our customers at
                group rates.
                  In
                    conjunction
                      with the offering of these services, we will only share
        your
                    name and address with the providers. We may also periodically
                    contract with
                      our card services providers to offer program benefits for
                our cardholders. In order to properly administer the benefits
        under the programs,
                  it is necessary
                    to share only your name, address, and card number with these
        providers.</p>            
      <p>As permitted by the 
        Fair Credit Reporting Act, we may share all credit information about
        customers  with our affiliates. This includes information obtained
        from you on applications, information 
        obtained from third parties by verifying the statements that you
         make on your applications, and information obtained from consumer reporting
        
        agencies. Since FirstBank is a multi-bank holding company with separately
         chartered banks, this sharing of information helps us to better serve
        
        your banking needs and allows you to take advantage of services
         at all of the FirstBank locations. </p>
      <p>For questions or concerns 
        regarding the FirstBank privacy policy, the Internet site, or any aspect 
        of FirstBank, please contact us by calling 303-238-9000 or 1-800-964-3444 
        (outside of Metro Denver). If questions or comments don't contain time 
        sensitive or confidential information, an e-mail can also be sent to us 
        at <a href="mailto:banking@efirstbank.com">banking@efirstbank.com</a>.</p>
      <p>Any consumer customer 
        may use the form below to tell us not to share the above credit information
        with our affiliates. Your request to prevent sharing credit information
        will not apply to information about your transactions and experiences
        with us and our affiliates.</p>
      <p>If you wish to prevent the sharing of credit information, as described
        above, please read and sign the form below. You must then detach the
        signed form and mail it to FirstBank Holding Company, Attn: Compliance
        Department, 12345 W. Colfax, Ave., Lakewood, CO 80215. Please keep the
        remaining
        portion
        of
        this
        disclosure for your records. You may exercise this right
        at any time. </p>      
      <p>This policy applies 
        to all of the FirstBank affiliate locations in <a href="http://www.efirstbank.com/locations/viewall.html">Colorado</a> and <a href="http://www.efirstbankca.com/locations/viewall.html">California</a>.

            <p>If you currently maintain accounts with us and have previously
              told us not to share this information on any of your accounts,
              no response is necessary, as this information is not being shared.</p>            
            <p>As
                allowed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I understand that
                I have the right to prevent
        having my credit information shared among the affiliated banks of FirstBank
                Holding Company. By signing and returning
        this form, I realize that when I request deposit account or credit services
                at other FirstBank locations, it will be necessary for each bank
                to obtain
        its own credit report for me and obtain a new application from me. (Please
                note: Each party to the account that would like to prevent having
                their
        credit information shared must sign and be identified below. However,
                one party may sign for another account party. )</p>
