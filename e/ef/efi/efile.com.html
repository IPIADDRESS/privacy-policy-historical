<h1>Our  Commitment to your Privacy</h1>

<p>EFILE is  committed to keeping your information private and recognize the importance all  customers place on the privacy and confidentiality of their information. While  new technologies allow us to more efficiently serve our clients, we are  committed to maintaining the rigorous privacy standards that are synonymous  with our established and trusted name.</p>
<p>In  keeping with our Privacy Policy, we provide this Policy explaining our online  information practices and the choices you can make about the way your  information is collected and used. To make this Policy easy to find, we make it  available throughout our web site as well as on our tax screens within the tax  program.</p>
<p>EFILE  adheres to Federal and State regulations to ensure the security and  confidentiality of personal information shared with us during your tax  preparation and efile process. We are committed to respecting and protecting  your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and  management of any personally identifiable or tax related information you share  with us. &nbsp;Your tax return information  will be treated with extreme care and confidentiality. EFILE strives to comply  with all applicable U.S.  tax laws to protect your privacy. Our goal is to provide protection for your  personal information no matter where that personal information is collected,  transferred, or retained. </p>
<p>EFILE  partners with third parties to provide tax and financial services. When users  sign up for these particular services users are requested to accept specific  third party user agreements. If necessary EFILE shares names, or other  information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.  These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information  except for the purpose of providing these services. </p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a> <img src="../images/topArrow.gif"></p>
<h2>Covered  Web Sites </h2>
<p>The  Privacy Policy described herein is applicable to this entire web site,  including all areas where financial information is gathered and income tax data  is input, printed and/or transmitted. It does not apply to any other online  services, or to any other web sites published and/or maintained by us.</p>
<p>This  Privacy Policy covers all the online information practices of www.efile.com.  Other sites maintained by EFILE operate under their own Privacy and security  policies. Third party web sites operate under their own Privacy and security  policies.</p>

	<h2>Our  Commitment to Data Security</h2>
<p>To  prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use  of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and  managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect  online.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a> <img src="../images/topArrow.gif"></p>
	<h2>Internal  Controls</h2>
<p>When  collecting, storing and retrieving your personal data, extensive internal  controls are maintained throughout the process to ensure security and  confidentiality.</p>
<p>Our  Internet-based systems are protected behind firewalls, and all mission critical  servers are deployed in a cluster environment to provide an even greater level  of security and protection against system failure. All data is maintained and  backed-up on a regular schedule to provide adequate redundancy and ensure that  the integrity of information is never jeopardized.</p>
<p>Some of  our pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie"  is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information  about web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to  recall personal information previously indicated by a web user. Most browsers  allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how  to remove them. </p>
<p>You may  set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to  block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or  block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and  password to gain access to certain parts of the web site. </p>
<p>Tracking  technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names;  Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types;  clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. Our use of  cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our web site and  your web experience. We may also analyze information that does not contain  personal information for trends and statistics. </p>
<p>Our  employees are subject to strict guidelines regarding confidentiality, and  internal access to customer data is restricted to highly trained personnel on  an "as-needed" basis.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a> <img src="../images/topArrow.gif"></p>
	<h2>Transmitting  Information</h2>
<p>When  transmitting information between you and our server, as well as when  communicating with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for electronic filing,  data security is handled through a protocol called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).  SSL is an established and mature Internet security standard with two dominant  features: web server authentication and data encryption.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a> <img src="../images/topArrow.gif"></p>
<h2>Data  Encryption</h2>
<p>Data  encryption is the process of transforming legible information into a complex  arrangement of illegible information. SSL uses a private/public key combination  to encrypt data when it is sent and to decrypt data when it is received. SSL  encrypts data using a mathematical formula, also referred to as a  "key."</p>
<p>Encryption  strength is measured by the length of the key used to encrypt the data; the  longer the key, the more effective the encryption. Using the SSL protocol, data  transmission between you and our web server is performed at a standard level of  encryption strength.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a> <img src="../images/topArrow.gif"></p>
<h2>Web  Server Authentication</h2>
<p>An SSL  certificate is issued to ensure authentic and accurate identification of a  secured web server. This translates into a digital ID, an electronic  fingerprint, which is included in the key used to encrypt the data. Only our  web server, in this case, is able to decrypt the data that you transmit because  it is the intended (and digitally certified) secured web server for this data  transmission.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a> <img src="../images/topArrow.gif"></p>

	<h2>The  Information We Collect</h2>
<p>This  Policy applies to all information collected or submitted on our web site. If a  credit card is used to pay for the Service, in addition to tax return  information, we collect the following credit card and personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cardholder's  Name</li>
<li>Credit  Card Type</li>
<li>Credit  Card Number</li>
<li>Expiration  Date</li>
<li>Cardholder's  Billing Address</li>
<li>Daytime  Phone Number</li>
<li>E-mail Address</li>
<li>Employer's  or Relative's Phone Number</li>
</ul>
<p>The  credit card information is used to process your transaction. This information  is not made available to anyone else. </p>
<p>We also  collect the following information for use in answering your inquiries for  technical support when you submit an email requesting our assistance: </p>
<ul>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>User ID</li>
<li>E-mail Address</li>

<li>Operating  System</li>
<li>Browser Type</li>
<li>Connection type/speed</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">top</a> <img src="../images/topArrow.gif"></p>
<h2>The Way  We Use Information</h2>
<p>The tax  return information that we collect is used strictly for lawful purposes and is  never shared with federal, state or other taxing authorities without your  consent. The foregoing notwithstanding, we reserve the right to disclose your  information without your consent in response to a court order, subpoena, search  warrant or other inquiry or request from governmental or regulatory  authorities, or to protect against fraud or other criminal activities. If you  choose to electronically file your return, we will transmit your tax return to  the appropriate federal and state taxing authorities.</p>
<p>The IRS  requires us to provide the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer from  which the return originated, as well as the e-mail address of the person who  electronically filed the return. This information is sent to the IRS at the  time you choose to submit your return to the IRS for electronic filing.</p>
<p>In order  to electronically file your return, we must share your submitted tax  information with the appropriate tax authorities in order to complete your  request. You can control whether or not you wish your tax information shared  for this purpose by deciding whether or not to complete the tax returns forms,  which are all clearly labeled.</p>
<p>The above  listed credit card information that we collect will be used strictly for order  processing and billing purposes, and will not be shared with any other party.  When appropriate, bank account or credit card information is also passed to our  bank, for processing purposes, if you choose to use our Refund Anticipation  Loan (RAL), Credit Card Payment of Balance Due or Deduct Fee from Refund  options. You will enter this information during the routine course of a  purchase. In the event that our Internet Service staff should need to research  and resolve any status or billing issues associated with an order, the  information will only be accessed by authorized personnel.</p>
<p>Our Basic  Service entitles you to notification via e-mail of filing deadlines, estimate  reminders, tax law changes, as well as tax planning and financial information  that may affect your tax return. In order for us to provide you with the Basic  Service, it is required that you provide us with your e-mail address and  consent to our limited review of your tax return information with our  proprietary software program to determine whether your tax return information  would trigger such notifications.</p>
<p>In  addition to our Basic Service, we may send to you, via your e-mail address,  information and promotional messages about other products and services that we  think may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>Personally  identifiable information is only shared as indicated in this document. Any  sharing of such information is subject to the opt-out option as discussed in  the paragraph below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a> <img src="../images/topArrow.gif"></p>
	<h2>Consent  to Use Information</h2>
<p>By using  this web site, you consent to the terms of our Online Privacy Policy and to EFILE  processing of personal information for the purposes given above as well as  those explained where EFILE collects personal information on the web.</p>
<p>	Should  the Online Privacy Policy change, we intend to take every reasonable step to  ensure that these changes are brought to your attention by posting all changes  prominently on our web site for a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p>Your use  of this service means that you consent to our limited access and review of your  tax return information necessary to provide you with the Basic Service  described above.</p>
<p>In  addition, we may provide you with promotional messages. You will have the  option to opt-out of receiving such promotional messages. Declining to receive  e-mail promotional messages will not affect our ability to deliver our basic service  to you.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a> <img src="../images/topArrow.gif"></p>

	<h2>Third  Party Services</h2>
<p>For the  purpose of providing you with additional information or services, our web  site&nbsp; also provides links or references  to our other web sites or to third party web sites of online information  providers, advertisers, and other business partners. When offering partner  services the partner who will be receiving your information will be clearly  identified.</p>
<p>We are  not responsible for information gathered by third party web sites. You should  review any third party site's Privacy Policy for details regarding their  policies concerning information they gather. Any time you are preparing to  navigate to a site that is not covered by this Privacy Policy, we will indicate  at the bottom of the page that you are leaving our site.</p>
<p>Through a  third party partnership with Republic Bank &amp; Trust Company, you may apply  for a bank product. When you apply for a bank product you authorize us to  disclose your relevant personal and tax return information to Republic Bank &amp; Trust Company. Your  indication within the program that you wish to apply for a bank product serves  as your authorization. Your tax information is sent to Republic Bank &amp; Trust Company when your return is  e-filed. When you select the option within our program for a bank product, once  your return has qualified for electronic filing we share your name, address,  social security number, phone number and other tax related information  necessary for Republic Bank &amp; Trust Company to provide the requested service. Republic Bank &amp; Trust Company uses the personally  identifiable information for the purpose of providing your bank product. You  may visit the site at <a href="javascript:extpopup('https://www.republictaxpayer.com/')">https://www.republictaxpayer.com</a> to view their Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Through a  third party partnership with Official Payments Corporation®, you may request to  pay your balance due via credit or debit card. When you make this request, you  authorize us to disclose your relevant credit card and tax return information  to Official Payments Corporation. When you select the option within our program  to pay your balance due via credit or debit card, and your return has qualified  for electronic filing, we then share your name, address, social security  number, phone number and other tax related information necessary for Official  Payments Corporation to provide the requested service. In addition, you will be  asked to disclose your card information to Official Payments. Official Payments  uses the personally identifiable information for the purpose of providing the  payment of your tax via credit or debit card as requested. You may visit the  site at www.officialpayments.com to view their Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Information  entered into the Tax Calculators (through Time Value Software) is used solely  to provide you with estimates of various tax situations. The information used  in these calculations is not saved. You may visit the site at www.tvalue.com to  view their Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a> <img src="../images/topArrow.gif"></p>
<h2>Retrieving Your Information</h2>
<p>Our  Service is available for starting, completing and e-filing your return from  approximately mid-January through mid-October of each tax year. To view your  return information, you may use your User ID and Password to access a free  summary report and/or pay a fee to print, view, and electronically file your  actual return. Once you have paid, you may continue to access, modify and/or  print your tax return as often as needed during this time.</p>
<p>From  mid-October through mid-December you can still complete and mail your return to  the appropriate filing authorities if you began it prior to mid-October. </p>
<p>After  paying for your return, the financial information used to make your payment  (e.g. credit card number), as well as the record of your payment, will not be  retrievable by you.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a> <img src="../images/topArrow.gif"></p>
