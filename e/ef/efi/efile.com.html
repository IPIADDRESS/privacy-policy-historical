    <h2>
        Our Commitment to Data Security</h2>
    <p class="h2">
        To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use
        of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
        procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>
    <h2>
        Internal Controls</h2>
    <p class="h2">
        When collecting, storing, and retrieving your personal data, extensive internal
        controls are maintained throughout the process to ensure security and confidentiality.</p>
    <p class="h2">
        Our Internet-based systems are protected behind firewalls, and all mission critical
        servers are deployed in a cluster environment to provide an even greater level of
        security and protection against system failure. All data is maintained and backed-up
        on a regular schedule to provide adequate redundancy and ensure that the integrity
        of information is never jeopardized.</p>
    <p class="h2">
        Some of our pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A
        "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect
        information about web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve
        to recall personal information previously indicated by a web user. Most browsers
        allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to
        remove them.
    </p>
    <p class="h2">
        You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose
        to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase
        or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password

        Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names;
        Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream
        patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. Our use of cookies and
        other tracking technologies allows us to improve our web site and your web experience.
        We may also analyze information that does not contain personal information for trends
        and statistics.
    </p>
    <p class="h2">
        Our employees are subject to strict guidelines regarding confidentiality, and internal
        access to customer data is restricted to highly trained personnel on an "as-needed"
        basis.</p>
    <h2>
        Transmitting Information</h2>
    <p class="h2">
        When transmitting information between you and our server, as well as when communicating
        with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for electronic filing, data security is
        handled through a protocol called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL is an established
        and mature Internet security standard with two dominant features: web server authentication
        and data encryption.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="#top">top</a>
        <img src="/efile-images/topArrow.gif" alt=""></p>
    <h2>
        Data Encryption</h2>
    <p class="h2">
        Data encryption is the process of transforming legible information into a complex
        arrangement of illegible information. SSL uses a private/public key combination
        to encrypt data when it is sent and to decrypt data when it is received. SSL encrypts
        data using a mathematical formula, also referred to as a "key."</p>
    <p class="h2">
        Encryption strength is measured by the length of the key used to encrypt the data;
        the longer the key, the more effective the encryption. Using the SSL protocol, data
        transmission between you and our web server is performed at a standard level of
        encryption strength.</p>
    <h2>
        Web Server Authentication</h2>
    <p class="h2">
        An SSL certificate is issued to ensure authentic and accurate identification of
        a secured web server. This translates into a digital ID, an electronic fingerprint,
        which is included in the key used to encrypt the data. Only our web server, in this
        case, is able to decrypt the data that you transmit because it is the intended (and
        digitally certified) secured web server for this data transmission.</p>
    <h2>
        The Information We Collect</h2>
    <p class="h2">
        This Policy applies to all information collected or submitted on our web site. If
        a credit card is used to pay for the Service, in addition to tax return information,
        we collect the following credit card and personal information:</p>
    <ul class="ulh2">
        <li>Cardholder's Name</li><li>Credit Card Type</li><li>Credit Card Number</li><li>Expiration
            Date</li><li>Cardholder's Billing Address</li><li>Daytime Phone Number</li><li>E-mail
                Address</li><li>Employer's or Relative's Phone Number</li></ul>
    <p class="h2">
        The credit card information is used to process your transaction. This information
        is not made available to anyone else.
    </p>
    <p class="h2">
        We also collect the following information for use in answering your inquiries for
        technical support when you submit an email requesting our assistance:
    </p>

    <h2>
        The Way We Use Information</h2>
    <p class="h2">
        The tax return information that we collect is used strictly for lawful purposes
        and is never shared with federal, state, or other taxing authorities without your
        consent. The foregoing notwithstanding, we reserve the right to disclose your information
        without your consent in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or
        other inquiry or request from governmental or regulatory authorities, or to protect
        against fraud or other criminal activities. If you choose to electronically file
        your return, we will transmit your tax return to the appropriate federal and state
        taxing authorities.</p>

        The IRS requires us to provide the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer
        from which the return originated, as well as the e-mail address of the person who
        electronically filed the return. This information is sent to the IRS at the time
        you choose to submit your return to the IRS for electronic filing.</p>

        bank for processing purposes. You will enter this information during the routine
        course of a purchase. In the event that our internet service staff should need to
        research and resolve any status or billing issues associated with an order, the
        information will only be accessed by authorized personnel.</p>

        it is required that you provide us with your e-mail address and consent to our limited
        review of your tax return information with our proprietary software program to determine
        whether your tax return information would trigger such notifications.</p>

        In addition to our Basic Service, we may send to you, via your e-mail address, information
        and promotional messages about other products and services that we think may be
