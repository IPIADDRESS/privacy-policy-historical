<strong><a id="commitment-privacy">Our Commitment to Privacy</a></strong><br>
<br>
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this Privacy Statement to explain how your information is collected (both on-line and off-line) and used, and to explain the choices you can make about the way your information is shared. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available by a web link on our homepage.<br>
<br>
EFI does not sell or share the Personal Information (defined herein) it collects from you with third parties except as described in this Privacy Statement. This Privacy Statement covers the information practices of EFI and applies to information submitted and collected online by, through, or via an EFI website which includes a reference to this Privacy Statement on the applicable homepage (collectively, “EFI Websites” or individually, an “EFI Website”) and to information collected off-line by EFI. This Privacy Statement may be subject to any specific and applicable EFI affiliate privacy statement and our privacy practices may vary as required by local law.<br>
<br>

<br>
<p>
<strong><a id="info-we-collect">The Information We Collect</a></strong><br>
<br>
Personal Information: If you wish to contact EFI, we typically ask you to provide personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, contact phone numbers, and email address. This information helps us to reply to you. To use certain parts of the EFI Websites, you may be required to complete a registration form and provide contact information (such as name and email address). If you are making a purchase online, we will also require your credit/debit card information, expiration date, billing address, shipping address and related information. We also may ask for your date of birth to register for online forums. You may also provide additional personally identifiable information that you choose to include in an email that you send to us, via an EFI Website or through a resume you submit in connection with your interest in working for EFI. All of the above personally identifiable information, as well as any other such personally identifiable information that you choose to provide to us, is collectively referred to as “Personal Information” in this Privacy Statement. If you refuse to provide the Personal Information that EFI requires in order for EFI to provide you with a product, service or information, you may not receive the product, service or information.<br>
<br>
Non-Personal Information: You may provide certain non-personal information to us, such as the products you are using, your company name, your role with your company, electronic information collected through cookies or other similar means, other information in connection with a support request for one of our products, or any other information that you provide or we collect that is not Personal Information. All of this information is collectively referred to as “Non-Personal Information” in this Privacy Statement.<br>
<br>
<a href="#top">Back to top »</a></p>
<p><strong><a id="how-we-collect">How We Collect Information</a></strong></p>
<p>There are a number of ways in which EFI may collect Personal Information from you. Personal Information may be collected if you provide Personal Information in connection with using an EFI Website, including ordering a product or service, a webinar registration, EFI Website forms, faxes, surveys, product registrations, such as registrations associated with the installation of software, responses to mailed materials, subscription to our newsletter and other publications, participation in contests, telephone calls, EFI Website forums and message boards, and in person, such as at trade shows or other events. In addition, EFI may collect aggregate Non-Personal Information on the EFI Websites that customers access or visit through the use of cookies, clear GIFs and website logs, as described below.<br>
<br>
<em>
Cookies: </em>EFI may collect Non-Personal Information through the use of cookies. A cookie is a small file that a website puts on a user's hard drive. This file identifies specific information about previous visits to the website. The cookie may store the user's country, language, an assigned random session ID, name and address information or the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address associated with a user’s computer. EFI may use cookies for a variety of purposes, including without limitation: (i) to track the number of users to an EFI Website over time; (ii) recognize repeat visits to an EFI Website; (iii) to facilitate online navigation and online shopping; (iv) track pages visited during a single online session, analyze trends and gather broad demographic information; (v) adjust the presentation of an EFI Website to make it more effective; (vi) store user preferences; (vii) record session information, user-specific information (such as the pages the user accesses or visits) and past activity at an EFI Website; (viii) alert users to new areas of an EFI Website that we think might be of value; and (ix) market products and services to users. EFI may link the information it collects by the use of cookies to specific Personal Information. Some of our partners may use cookies on the EFI Websites. However, we have no access to or control over those cookies.<br>
<br>
Most browser applications allow you to block or limit the use of cookies. Consult the help menu of your browser application for details. If you block the use of cookies, you may not be able to use some of the features on an EFI Website.<br>
<br>
<em>
Clear GIFs: </em>Clear GIFs are small graphic images (in GIF or other image format) placed on a webpage, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (e.g., only 1-by-1 pixel) and either transparent or the same color as the background of the webpage, document or email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect Personal Information about you. We may, however, use clear GIFs to capture Non-Personal Information, such as statistical usage information for pages, features or other elements on the EFI Websites or through EFI email messages that are delivered to you. We may correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on the EFI Websites or in our emails.<br>
<br>
<em>
Website Logs: </em>EFI may collect Non-Personal Information in the form of website logs (collectively “Logs”). These Logs are files that record activity on the EFI Websites and gather statistics about users’ activities, such as how many users have visited the EFI Websites, how often, how many “hits” a particular webpage has received, type and quality of the user’s Internet connection to the EFI Websites, and identification of the user’s hardware and software. The entries comprising the Logs may contain IP addresses, user IDs, and identification of the Internet service provider that provides your connection to the Internet. Generally, we use the Logs to operate and improve the EFI Websites, to identify the popularity of certain features, to assist with internal marketing and demographic studies, and to enable us to assess overall efficiency and activity on the EFI Websites.<br>
<br>
<em>
Communications Within EFI Websites: </em>EFI may collect information that you submit when posting messages in an EFI Website forum. Any user communications within the EFI Websites, such as on the forums, should not be considered private and such communications may be viewed and saved by others. EFI is under no obligation to monitor user communications but reserves the right to act on reports of misconduct or abuse of communications privileges. Because communications may be widely viewed and/or heard, we caution users to avoid revealing any Personal Information on the EFI Website forums.<br>

Personal Information may be combined with Non-Personal Information. Information collected on-line may be combined with information collected off-line. Personal Information may be enhanced or merged with data from third parties for the purposes of marketing products or services that may be of interest to you.<br>
<br>
<a href="#top">Back to top »</a><br><br>
<p>
<a id="how-we-share"><strong>How We Share Your Information</strong></a><br>
<br>
EFI may share your information, including Personal Information, within EFI or with any unaffiliated third party, including EFI’s partners, as described in this section. EFI’s partners include independent vendors, suppliers, licensors, contractors, distributors, resellers, dealers, OEMs and other parties who have a business relationship or a potential business relationship with EFI.<br>
<br>
Fulfillment of Products and/or Services Provided by or for EFI: EFI may retain other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include, but are not limited to: (i) companies that help to administer the EFI Websites; (ii) companies that help to process an order for a product, which may include completing the order, obtaining export clearance, or arranging for shipping and handling; (iii) companies that provide payment and billing services; (iv) companies that conduct surveys or assist EFI in its promotional activities such as contacting you by email or over the telephone; (v) shipping companies that deliver products, third party advertisers or promotional partners who provide a product or service to you; (vi) customer support specialists; (vii) web hosting and internet service providers; and (viii) data analysis firms. Any such third parties who are involved in these activities are authorized to use the information that is collected by and/or disclosed to them for purposes of fulfilling their contractual obligations to EFI, fulfilling any obligations owed to you and to the other individuals who access and use the EFI Websites or services, or as otherwise permitted in this Privacy Statement. EFI requires that any such third parties protect the confidentiality of Personal Information they collect or have access to in the course of their engagement by EFI.<br>
<br>
Marketing Materials: From time to time, EFI may share your Personal Information with other companies, so that these third parties may provide you with a special offer or promotion that we think you may find valuable. Unless you specifically tell us that you do not want to receive these special offers, we may share your Information. See How You Can Opt-Out to tell us that you do not want us to share your Personal Information for these purposes.<br>
<br>
Sale or Transfer of Information: In the event of a merger, acquisition, spin-off or other transaction related to EFI, an EFI business unit or a portion of EFI’s assets, EFI may transfer the information collected from you, including Personal Information, to the surviving party, acquiring party or other party related to the transaction. You consent to the sale and transfer of your information as described in this paragraph.<br>
<br>
Compliance with Law and Fraud Protection: EFI reserves the right to disclose the information it collects from you if EFI believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law or legal process, to avoid liability for EFI and/or its agents and partners, and/or to protect the rights and property (including intellectual property) of EFI and others, including EFI’s agents, partners and customers. Further, EFI may disclose the information it collects if EFI suspects that an individual or entity has provided fraudulent or illegal information, has committed an illegal, fraudulent or wrongful act or omission, has attempted to pose as someone else, or has attempted an unauthorized use or access of any computer system or website.<br>
<br>
<a href="#top">Back to top »</a></p>
<p><a id="commitment-data-security"><strong>Our Commitment to Data Security</strong></a><br>
<br>
While EFI cannot guarantee complete security of the information we collect from you, we have implemented commercially reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to aid in the prevention of unauthorized access to and improper use of the information we collect from you and to aid in the accurate maintenance of this information. You should be aware, however, that EFI has no control over the security of other websites or services on the Internet that you might visit even when a link may appear to direct you to websites and services from EFI. We want you to feel confident using the EFI Websites; however, no system, can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take commercially reasonable steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information, other communications or content always will remain secure.<br>
<br>

The EFI Websites contain links to other websites. Please be aware that EFI cannot control and is not responsible for the information collection practices of such websites, which may differ from those of EFI.

The information that EFI collects from you may be collected, transferred to, stored and processed in the United States and any other country in which EFI and its agents and partners maintain facilities. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other applicable countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using an EFI Website or providing your information to EFI or its agents and partners, you consent to your information being collected, transferred to, stored and processed in the United States and other applicable countries.

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information at the EFI Websites from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of the EFI Websites are structured to attract anyone under 13. If EFI becomes aware that any person submitting Personal Information to us is under the age of 13, we will delete that Personal Information.<br>
