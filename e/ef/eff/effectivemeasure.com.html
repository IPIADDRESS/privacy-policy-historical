						<h3>Privacy Statement for Visitors Tracked by Effective Measure</h3>
<p><strong>Privacy Principles</strong><br> Your trust and confidence is important to us, Effective Measure conducts its business under the following privacy principles:</p>
<p><strong>Effective Measure Acts as an Agent for our Customers</strong><br> Effective Measure acts as an Agent for each of our Customers, in that we provide our services solely for the benefit of the customer. Each of our customers uses Effective Measure to understand more about the visitors to its web sites; in this way, our customers can provide online advertisers with third party independent statistics that help demonstrate their site audience. This data may include search engine referral, affiliate referrals, traffic driven by banner ads or other online promotions, how visitors navigate around the site, the most popular websites or sections.</p>
<p>We also collect certain technical information, such as the browser version and operating system. We aggregate all of the usage data from our customers websites into a Benchmarking solution that demonstrates their metrics to advertisers and other interested parties. We do, however, reserve a limited right to disclose any data we collect if required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority.</p>
<p>We only collect anonymous usage data from safe websites which are registered on our system. These websites parrticipate in Effective Measure by placing a small piece of tracking code on each of their webpages. To see more information on this, please visit the following <a title="Website Tag" href="http://www.effectivemeasure.com/the-interface/site-tagging/" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Our Customers' Use of Effective Measure</strong><br> We ask each of our customers to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations, as we promise our customers that we will do ourselves. We also recommend that each customer obtain all necessary consents from visitors to its web site(s), post an online privacy policy that provides each visitor with notice of its data collection and use practices (including the customer's use of Effective Measure), and provide a link to the Effective Measure privacy policy.</p>
<p><br> <strong>Use of Cookies and Other Data Collection Methods</strong><br> In providing Effective Measure to our customers, it is Effective Measure's policy to use cookies and Rich Internet Applications (RIA) only for more accurate traffic analysis. The combination of information does not include personal data such as name, age, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.</p>
<p>If you would prefer, you can set you're your browser to reject cookies.</p>
<p>In two specific cases, 1) When a visitor opts in to complete a demographic survey or 2) when they elect to Opt Out of measurement, Effective Measure will utilise a Local Shared Object (a "Flash cookie") to help identify the users preference and ensure compliance with Opt Outs and privacy wishes. You can clear out or completely disable your local shared object by <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">visiting this page</a>.</p>
<p>Effective Measure customers use JavaScript tracking code provided by Effective Measure to track information about their web site visitors' activity. This code contacts Effective Measure's servers and receives a response.</p>
<p>From time to time we may also administer random “interactive pop-up” surveys to some users of our customers Web sites while they are visiting those web sites. These surveys request additional demographic, non-personally identifiable information. Your participation in a survey is always voluntary, and you therefore have a choice as to whether or not to provide the requested survey information. We use the information collected in the survey, in conjunction with information gathered through our cookies and code, in order to provide our customers with an even more detailed understanding of their Internet audience.</p>
<p>The technology used by Effective Measure is not intended to collect personally identifiable information. In some limited circumstances, however, some voluntary personally identifiable may be captured—when, for example, personal information such as an email address or telephone number is incorporated into a survey for the awarding of a prize draw or opt-in agreed follow up research.</p>
<p>Effective Measure does NOT use personally identifiable information inadvertently captured in this manner, nor will we ever share any of this personally identifiable information with our customers. Your personally identifiable information will NEVER be used by Effective Measure to advertise, promote or market third party goods or services to you.</p>
