					Your privacy is very important to us.  However, we collect and, in some cases, disclose 
					information about you as part of the normal operation of our site.  This Privacy Policy 
					describes the information we collect about you and what may happen to that information.  
					As described below, some of your personally identifiable information is disclosed to 
					third parties and used by us and third parties.  By accepting the user agreement, you 
					expressly consent to such use and disclosure of your personally identifiable and other 
					personal information.
				</font>
				</p><p>
				<b>Information About You</b>
				<br>
				<font size="-1">
					We ask you to provide information when you register for the eFax.com services.  This 
					information includes your name and email address, while other information such as 
					mailing address and phone number remain optional.
					</font></p><p><font size="-1">
					It is eFax.com's policy to respect the privacy of its members. Although we do not sell 
					or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party, we may, 
					in certain cases where you access our site from other third party sites, release your 
					email address to such third party.  We do not disclose certain pieces of information, 
					such as your password, PIN, or eFax number at all.  We may aggregate personally identifiable 
					information and disclose such information to third parties in aggregate for a number 
					of business purposes, including running an enhancing the services, but in these 
					situations we do not disclose to other entities any information that could be used to 
					personally identify you.  Also, we may use information about you to provide you with 
					ads or offers from advertisers that we think may be relevant to you, but in these 
					cases we do not disclose any personally identifiable information about you to third 
					parties.
					</font></p><p><font size="-1">
					In the course of using our site and our services, we automatically track certain 
					information about you.  This information may include the number and source of fax 
					transmissions, the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or 
					not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser 
					you are using, and your IP address.  We use this information in the normal operation 
					of the site and we may disclose this information on an aggregated basis.
					</font></p><p><font size="-1">
					We currently do not use cookies on our site, although we reserve the right to add 
					cookies at a later time.  Among other reasons, cookies could allow us to require 
					you to enter your password only once during a session.  Cookies can also help us 
					provide advertising which is targeted to your interests.  Cookies are stored on 
					your hard drive, not on our site.  Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning 
					that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session.  You are always 
					free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you 
					may be required to reenter your password multiple times during a session.
					</font></p><p><font size="-1">
					If you send us correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or 
					third parties send us correspondence about your use of our services, we may 
					collect such information into a file specific to you.  We use information in the 
					file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and 
					past use of the service, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce 
					our user agreement.
				</font>
				</p><p>
				<b>The Content of Your Transmissions</b><br>
				<font size="-1">
					eFax.com acts as a passive conduit for the distribution and receipt of your fax 
					transmissions and therefore will not monitor, edit, or disclose the contents of 
					a Member's private communications unless required to do so by law or in the good 
					faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the 
					law or comply with legal process served on eFax.com; (2) protect and defend the 
					rights or property of eFax.com; or (3) act under exigent circumstances to protect 
					the personal safety of its members or the public.  Member should also be aware 
					(and hereby agrees) that certain technical processing of and access to fax and 
					email messages and their content, eFax.com may be required to: (a) route the 
					messages; (b) conform to connecting networks' technical requirements; (c) conform 
					to the limitations of the Service; or (d) conform to other similar requirements.
					</font></p><p><font size="-1">
					eFax.com will store your personal transmissions on its servers for a limited time 
					and will endeavor to purge old transmissions from its servers when the expiration 
					period has run (one to three days for standard service, and up to thirty days for 
					premium services). We use industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality 
					of your transmissions (as well as your personally identifiable information), such as 
					firewalls and SSL technology.  These are the same technologies that most websites use 
					to safeguard credit card information and other personal information.  However, that 
					said, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet (or anywhere, for that matter.)
				</font>
				</p><p>
				<b>Your Email Address</b>
				<br>
				<font size="-1">
					As part of our service, we will send to you your incoming fax transmissions, but in 
					addition we may send to you periodic emails containing information about us, updates 
					on new service features, service usage tips, information about third party services 
					that are likely to be of interest to our members, and member satisfaction questions.  
					For now, we think we will send about 3-4 such email(s) per month.  If you do not want 
					to receive these emails, at any time you can cancel your service notifying us via our 
					eFax.com support <a href="/help/support.html">form</a> that you wish to cancel your 
					account.  In addition to the periodic emails, we may use your email 
					address to send you administrative notices about your account (such as notices about 
					pending activities).
				</font>
				</p><p>
				<b>Third Party Collectors of Information</b>
				<br>
				<font size="-1">
					Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.  
					To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, different rules may 
					apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them.  To 
					the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy customs 
					and policies.  Since we do not control the privacy policies of third parties, we 
					encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
				</font>
				</p><p>
				<b>Nondisclosure Can't Be Guaranteed</b>
				<br>
				<font size="-1">
					Unfortunately (and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this policy), due to the 
					existing regulatory and technical environment, we cannot guarantee that all of your 
					communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in 
					ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.  By way of example (without limiting 
					the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third 
					parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access 
					your transmissions or communications.  Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose 
					any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our 
					sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.  Therefore, although we use industry 
					standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, 
					that your personally identifiable information or communications will remain private. 
				</font>
				</p><p>
				<b>Junk Faxes</b>
				<br>
				<font size="-1">
					Finally, it is our intention to use legally available means to prevent distribution and 
					receipt of unsolicited commercial faxes ("junk faxes") through the service, and we 
					specifically restrict members from taking any actions which impose an unreasonable or 
					disproportionately large load on eFax.com resources.  We would like to ask that any 
					member that is annoyed by receipt of such junk faxes, please 
					report such activity to eFax.com via our eFax.com support 
					<a href="/help/support.html">form</a> so that we can 
					attempt to prevent further junk faxes from the same source.

Your privacy is very important to us. However, we collect and, in some cases, disclose information about you as part of the normal operation of our site. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you and what may happen to that information. As described below, some of your personally identifiable information is disclosed to third parties and used by us and third parties. By accepting the user agreement, you expressly consent to such use and disclosure of your personally identifiable and other personal information. 
</font>
<p>
<b>Information About You</b><br>
<font size="-1">
We ask you to provide information when you register for the eFax.com services. This information includes your name and email address, while other information such as mailing address and phone number remain optional. 
</font></p><p><font size="-1">
It is eFax.com's policy to respect the privacy of its members. Although we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party, we may, in certain cases where you access our site from other third party sites, release your email address to such third party. We do not disclose certain pieces of information, such as your password, PIN, or eFax number at all. We may aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information to third parties in aggregate for a number of business purposes, including running an enhancing the services, but in these situations we do not disclose to other entities any information that could be used to personally identify you. Also, we may use information about you to provide you with ads or offers from advertisers that we think may be relevant to you, but in these cases we do not disclose any personally identifiable information about you to third parties. 
</font></p><p><font size="-1">
In the course of using our site and our services, we automatically track certain information about you. This information may include the number and source of fax transmissions, the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. We use this information in the normal operation of the site and we may disclose this information on an aggregated basis. 
</font></p><p><font size="-1">
We use cookies on our site. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although you may miss out on some shortcuts, automation, special promotions and the like.
</font></p><p><font size="-1">
If you send us correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your use of our services, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past use of the service, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our user agreement. 
</font>
</p><p>
<b>The Content of Your Transmissions</b><br>
<font size="-1">
eFax.com acts as a passive conduit for the distribution and receipt of your fax transmissions and therefore will not monitor, edit, or disclose the contents of a Member's private communications unless required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on eFax.com; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of eFax.com; or (3) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of its members or the public. Member should also be aware (and hereby agrees) that certain technical processing of and access to fax and email messages and their content, eFax.com may be required to: (a) route the messages; (b) conform to connecting networks' technical requirements; (c) conform to the limitations of the Service; or (d) conform to other similar requirements. 
</font></p><p><font size="-1">
eFax.com will store your personal transmissions on its servers for a limited time and will endeavor to purge old transmissions from its servers when the expiration period has run (one to three days for standard service, and up to thirty days for premium services). We use industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your transmissions (as well as your personally identifiable information), such as firewalls and SSL technology. These are the same technologies that most websites use to safeguard credit card information and other personal information. However, that said, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet (or anywhere, for that matter.) 
</font>
</p><p>
<b>Your Email Address</b><br>
<font size="-1">
As part of our service, we will send to you your incoming fax transmissions, but in addition we may send to you periodic emails containing information about us, updates on new service features, service usage tips, information about third party services that are likely to be of interest to our members, and member satisfaction questions. For now, we think we will send about 3-4 such email(s) per month. If you do not want to receive these emails, at any time you can cancel your service notifying us via our <a href="/contactus">eFax.com support form</a> that you wish to cancel your account. In addition to the periodic emails, we may use your email address to send you administrative notices about your account (such as notices about pending activities). 
</font>
</p><p>
<b>Third Party Collectors of Information</b><br>
<font size="-1">
Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy customs and policies. Since we do not control the privacy policies of third parties, we encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others. 
</font>
</p><p>
<b>Nondisclosure Can't Be Guaranteed</b><br>
<font size="-1">
Unfortunately (and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this policy), due to the existing regulatory and technical environment, we cannot guarantee that all of your communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access your transmissions or communications. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or communications will remain private.  
</font>
</p><p>
<b>Junk Faxes</b><br>
<font size="-1">
Finally, it is our intention to use legally available means to prevent distribution and receipt of unsolicited commercial faxes ("junk faxes") through the service, and we specifically restrict members from taking any actions which impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on eFax.com resources. We would like to ask that any member that is annoyed by receipt of such junk faxes, please report such activity to eFax.com via our eFax.com support form so that we can attempt to prevent further junk faxes from the same source.
