	<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>At EHBOX, we recognize that many consumers who visit our web sites are  concerned about any information they provide us online, and how we maintain and  use this information. To address these concerns and to demonstrate our  commitment to privacy, we have developed and implemented this Privacy Policy  for our company. As this policy may change from time to time, we encourage you  to periodically check it.</p>
		  <p>What We Collect And How We Use It:</p>
		  <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>We only collect personally       identifiable information that you voluntarily and knowingly provide us;</p>
            </li>
		    <li>
		      <p>We use the information that       you provide us only for the purpose(s) for which you specifically provided       it or for specific additional purposes for which we receive your prior       consent;</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <p>We do not share any       information you provide us with anyone outside of EHBOX, and it's       affiliates. </p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <p>We may use a technology       called "cookies" to enhance your experience on our sites.</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <p>We employ appropriate       security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of any       information you provide us; and</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <p>We provide you with choice       and control over the collection and use of any personally identifiable information       that you provide us online, and a means for updating, correcting or       removing this information;</p>
		    </li>
	      </ul>
		  <p>General</p>
		  <p>We only collect personally identifiable information on a voluntary basis. We  do not require that you provide this information to gain access to our sites,  and we do not require you to disclose more information than is reasonably  needed to participate in an activity on our sites. We collect personally  identifiable information primarily to e-mail updates and news, for entry into  promotions and to notify subsequent winners, to send out brochures, etc. via  regular mail to subscribers, and to respond to your questions or suggestions.  We do not sell any information we gather at our web sites to anyone outside of EHBOX,  and its affiliates. We do not transfer or disclose any information we gather at  our web sites to anyone outside of EHBOX, and its affiliates, without your  prior consent, except (1) in cases where we believe in good faith that we have  a legal obligation to disclose such information, and (2) to certain suppliers  that assist EHBOX, and its affiliates, in maintaining and managing the  activities on its web sites. Please be assured that these suppliers are legally  obligated to maintain the confidentiality of this information and do not  acquire any rights to use your information for their own benefit. We may share  non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (for example, the % of  male and female visitors to our sites) with advertisers, business partners,  sponsors, and other third parties in an effort to customize or enhance the  content and advertising on our sites for our users.<br>
		    We do reserve the right, in connection with the potential sale or transfer  of the interests of EHBOX and its subsidiaries and affiliates, to sell or  transfer your information (including but not limited to your address, name,  age, gender, zip code, state, and country of residency and other information that  your provide through other communications) to a third party entity that (1)  concentrates its business in a similar practice or service, (2) agrees to be EHBOX  successor in interest with regard to the maintenance and protection of the  information collected, and (3) agrees to the obligations of this privacy  policy.</p>
		  <h4>Cookies</h4>
		  <p>Like many companies, we may use a technology called "cookies" to  enhance your experience on our sites. The cookies EHBOX uses do not contain any  personally identifiable information and can not profile your system or collect  information from your hard drive. You are not identified by name or e-mail  address, just by a unique string of numbers that we assign the first time you  come to our site.</p>
		  <h4>Security</h4>
		  <p>We employ appropriate security measures to protect the loss, misuse and  alteration of the information under our control. For our EHBOX.com site, we  employ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you  input, as an additional security measure. However, as no on-line data transmission  can be guaranteed to be totally secure, we (like all web sites) cannot warrant  or guarantee 100% security of any information you transmit to us at our web  sites.</p>
		  <h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>
		  <p>Neither EHBOX, nor any of it's affiliates, shall have any responsibility of  any nature whatsoever for other web sites linked to this web site, or any  information contained thereon, none of which has been verified or endorsed by  either EHBOX or any of it's affiliates.</p>
