                    <b>Questionnaires and Profiles</b>
                    <br>
                    <li>eHarmony collects a wide variety of personal information about you and others when you register and as you use the eHarmony Service.  eHarmony, and its third party service providers use this information to provide the eHarmony relationship service and related services.</li>

Except as explicitly provided herein, none of the information collected by eHarmony as part of the intake questionnaire used by the matching engine or personality profile is made accessible to the public, other users of the site or anyone not employed by eHarmony directly.</li>

                    <li>Information collected by eHarmony will not be shared with other eHarmony users except as expressly allowed by you, or in a manner in which your true identity is not revealed - i.e. no personally identifying details revealed, and only be shown to potential match candidates.  In this Privacy Policy, we will refer to information that reveals personally identifiable information as "Personal Data" and to information that does not reveal any personally identifiable information about a user as "Anonymous Data".</li>
                    <li>Non-subscribing visitors to eHarmony are not allowed access to Personal Data or Anonymous Data in any way, other than Anonymous Data displayed as part of a user profile, which is viewable by other users who are matched with that user.</li>

                    <b>Information Supplied by You at Registration or Purchase</b>

In general, you will receive one email notification that you have placed an order, and another email notification that your order has been filled.  You will be similarly notified of subscription renewal transactions when they occur.</li>
                    <li>Credit card transactions:  eHarmony uses industry standard third party credit card processing procedures which use encryption to protect your confidential financial information.  eHarmony will only use your credit card and other financial details that you may supply for the e-commerce transaction authorized by you on the eHarmony site.</li>
                    <li>Email contact: eHarmony fully complies with the requirements of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth).

Once you begin eHarmony's registration process, we may also occasionally send you newsletters and email you notifications of special events or product or service offerings at eHarmony and, with your consent, offers on behalf of our trusted partners.  If you have started, but not completed, the registration process, we may also send you email messages encouraging you to complete the process and become a subscriber.</li>

                    <li>All of the email messages we send you may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the emails, including whether the email was opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked.

                    <li>Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site.  We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content or advertising that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.

                    <li>Advertisements, promotions and offers from third-party advertisers may be provided to you while you are visiting the eHarmony web site.

Please refer to the third-party advertiser's own privacy policy (provided on the offer pages) if you have any questions regarding how your information is used.  Please be aware that these offers may be presented on pages which may appear to be eHarmony but are in fact a third party site with an eHarmony look and feel.</li>
                    <li>eHarmony Corporate Transactions:  As we develop eHarmony's business, we may buy or sell various corporate assets as our eHarmony service evolves.  By registering with eHarmony you agree that eHarmony may transfer all or a portion of your personally identifiable information that you have supplied to eHarmony to a new company as part of this type of transaction.
