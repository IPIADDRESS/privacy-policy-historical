<p>This statement
discloses the privacy practices for the <b>eHarmony</b> website, which may be

collection, correction and/or deletion of information. </p>

<p><a name="info"></a><strong>Information We Collect and How It's Used</strong></p>

<p><strong>Questionnaires
and Profiles </strong></p>

<p><strong>eHarmony</strong> collects a wide variety
of information which is used in order to find matches which offer the highest
possible chance of a successful long-term relationship or marriage. Except as
explicitly provided herein, none of the information collected by <b>eHarmony</b>
as part of the intake questionnaire used by the matching engine or personality
profile is made accessible to the public, other users of the site or anyone not
employed by <b>eHarmony</b> directly. This information is held strictly
confidential and can be deleted at the user's request. Information collected
during the intake questionnaire which may be shared with other users of <b>eHarmony</b>
will be displayed in a strictly anonymous manner with no personally identifying
details, and will only be shown to potential match candidates. Non-subscribing
visitors to <b>eHarmony</b> are not allowed access to this information in any
way. </p>

<p>By using
eHarmony.com, you agree to allow us to anonymously use the information from you
and your experiences through eHarmony.com to continue our research into
successful relationships. This research, conducted by psychologists and
behavior research scientists, may be published in academic journals. However,
all of your responses will be kept anonymous, and no personal identifying
information will ever be published. You can find out more about the standards
we follow in conducting scientific research at the following site: <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.htm">http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.htm.</a>
</p>

<p><strong>Information
Supplied by You at Registration or Purchase</strong></p>

<p><strong>eHarmony</strong> offers a
subscriber-based service to users seeking partners, as well as offering
products related to successful relationships and personal growth for retail
sale. To process subscriptions and/or product purchases, we may require your
name, billing address, phone number, email address, shipping address and credit
card information. Information gathered during product purchases is used
primarily to process your order or as otherwise described herein. In general,
you will receive one email notification that you have placed an order, and
another email notification that your order has been filled. You will be
similarly notified of subscription renewal transactions when they occur. Email
contact Information provided by you is also used primarily to notify you of
potential match candidates identified by <b>eHarmony</b> based on your matching
criteria and profile. Once you begin <b>eHarmony's</b> registration process, we
may also occasionally send you newsletters and email you notifications of
special events or product offerings at <b>eHarmony</b>. If you have started,
but not completed, the registration process, we may also send you email
messages encouraging you to complete the process and become a subscriber. All
of the email messages we send you may contain code that enables our database to
track your usage of the emails, including whether the email was opened and/or
what links (if any) were clicked. If you would rather not receive emails about
new products, promotions or other noteworthy news, please see the section below
labeled "Choice/Opt-out". <b>EHarmony</b> fully complies with the
requirements of the federal CAN-SPAM Act. </p>

<p>Demographic and
profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our
visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might
be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.
Some of this information (i.e., customer demographic information) may be shared
with advertisers on an aggregate, non personally identifiable basis. </p>

<p>Advertisements,
promotions and offers from third-party advertisers may be provided to you while
you are visiting the eHarmony web site. If you choose to accept any such
offers, eHarmony may provide your information, including billing information,
to the advertiser. </p>

<p>When purchasing an eHarmony
subscription, advertisements, promotions and offers from third-party
advertisers may be
provided to you.√Ø¬ø¬Ω If you choose to accept any such offers, eHarmony will
provide your information, including billing information, to the advertiser by
pre-populating the offer registration forms.√Ø¬ø¬Ω Your information will not be
transferred until you actually accept the offer.√Ø¬ø¬Ω You may opt-out of the offer
at any time up until this point.√Ø¬ø¬Ω Please refer to the third-party advertisers
own privacy policy (provided on the offer pages) if you have any questions
regarding how your information is used.</p>

<p>Please be aware that these offers may
be presented on pages framed by the eHarmony website.√Ø¬ø¬Ω We do
this to provide a seamless experience.√Ø¬ø¬Ω Although these offer pages have the
look and feel of our website, you will be submitting your information directly
to the third-party advertiser.</p>

<p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets and, depending on
the
transaction, your personally identifiable information may be one of the
transferred assets. In the event that we are acquired by another company, your
personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring
party.  If this occurs, you will be notified if there are any material changes
to the way your personally identifiable information is collected or used.</p>

<p>Credit card
transactions are processed through industry standard secure socket layer
encryption by <a href="http://www.cybersource.com">a</a> third party, which
only uses your information for that purpose.</p>

<p>We will only
share your information with third-parties in the ways defined in this privacy
statement.</p>

<p><strong>Information
Supplied by Your Browser</strong></p>

<p><strong>eHarmony</strong> also logs IP addresses
for systems administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user's
session. This gives <b>eHarmony</b> an idea of which parts of our site users
are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable.
This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be
anonymous. </p>

<p>Our site uses
cookies to keep track of some types of information while you are visiting or
using <b>eHarmony</b>. Cookies are very small files placed on your computer, so
that when you return to <b>eHarmony</b> we can identify you. Cookies are needed
for the <b>eHarmony</b> site to operate properly. If your browser is set to
reject all cookies, the site will not function properly. </p>

<p><strong>Third-Party
Advertising</strong></p>

<p>We may use
third-party advertising agencies to serve ads on behalf of eHarmony or
third-party advertisers (e.g., retailers of goods or services). These companies
may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web
beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third
parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. </p>

<p><strong>Legal
Disclaimer</strong></p>

<p>Though we make
every effort to preserve user privacy, we may disclose information you provide
if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure
is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on us; (2)
protect and defend our rights or property; (3) act in an emergency to protect
someone's safety or (4) as expressly provided herein. </p>

<p><a name="age"></a><strong>Age Restrictions</strong></p>

<p><strong>eHarmony</strong> will not create matches
for anyone under the age of 20. All adults are welcome to explore the site,
complete the Relationship Questionnaire and obtain a Personality Profile. As
