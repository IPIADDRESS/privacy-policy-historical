                    used to approximate a device’s location. In some cases, we assign the latitude and longitude of the centre
                    of a city or state on record for you to your profile as a way to improve our analytics and matches for
                    you. This is a general latitude and longitude and does not correspond to your real time or historical
                    location specifically.

                    to us, such as contact details, demographic information, Internet navigation details (for example, how
                    your mouse moves on a screen, which tells us if you are a bot or not) or fraud prevention information.
                    Financial institutions or payment processors may also provide us updated payment information or payment
                    methods related to your paid account or paid subscription and services.

                    stored in our database. These measures include the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and/or strong encryption
                    (3DES) technology during credit card transactions and administrative access to site data as well as other
                    proprietary security measures which are applied to all repositories and transfers of user information.
                    We will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission of information between your computer
                    and our servers, but given that no information transmitted over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure,
                    we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet and hence

                <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity

                        Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy
                        of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

                        reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your
                        personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below),
                        where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal
                        data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your
                        request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the
                        time of your request.

                        this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right
                        to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases,
                        we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override
                        your rights and freedoms.

                        data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the accuracy of the personal data;
                        (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where we no longer
                        need the personal data for the purposes set out above, but we are required by you for the establishment,
                        exercise or defence of legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need
                        to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
