            <p><strong>Effective Date: June 1, 2007</strong></p>
            
            <p>This Privacy and Information Security Policy ("Privacy Policy" or "this Policy") discusses the personally identifying information ("PII" or "Information") that we collect about you when you use the services we provide at <a href="http://www.ehow.com/">http://www.ehow.com/</a>.</p>  
            
            <p>
				<strong>Who We Are.  We are eHow, Inc</strong> (<strong>"eHow," "eHow.com," " "Site," "we," "us,"</strong> or <strong>"our"</strong>).<br>
				eHow.com is a popular place to find clear instructions on how to do a great variety of things. Visitors to the Site have access to thousands of articles on a variety of subjects. eHow also offers individuals with the opportunity to post content and to share their ideas with others. In the context of pursuing that business, as further described below, we collect various information, including PII, from and about the individuals who either contribute Content to or visit our Site.
			</p>
            <p>
				<strong>How does this Policy relate to my use of the Site?</strong><br><a target="_blank" title="BBBOnLine's trustmark" href="http://www.bbbonline.org/cks.asp?id=1116000369" style="float:right;margin-left:12px;margin-bottom:12px;"><img alt="BBBOnLine" src="/images/bbb_logo.gif"></a>
				This Policy is part of and incorporated into our Terms of Use, the contract between you and us that governs this Site. That means provisions of those terms impact this Policy, so if you have not read the <a href="/terms_use.aspx">Terms of Use</a>, read them now by clicking on the link.  All capitalized terms below that are not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms, and all other terms defined therein are incorporated herein by reference.
            </p>  
            
            <p><strong>YOUR AGREEMENT WITH US. BY PROVIDING PII OR OTHER INFORMATION TO US OR BY USING OUR SITE, YOU AGREE TO THIS POLICY AND THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED HEREIN. AND THE TERMS OF USE.</strong></p>

            <h2 class="SubHeader">I.	What Personal Information About Me Does eHow Gather?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Information You Give Us:  
                    <p>We collect any information you enter on our Site or give us in any other way (such as through an email or letter). We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, providing our services, our business operations, the maintenance of your Account (including without limitation, the preparation, distribution and filing by third party service providers of various tax and other reporting forms on our behalf), providing you with advertising and non-advertising content that we believe would be of interest to you, and communicating with you, all as described in greater detail below.</p> 
                    
                    <p>The information that we collect varies depending upon how you are interacting with our site.  Our registration forms generally require that you provide us with your user name, birthday and e-mail address, and that you create and provide us with a password.  We may also request certain other information, such as your actual first and last name, gender and postal or zip code. In addition, under the Terms of Use (full copy available <a href="/terms_use.aspx">here</a>),  to post Content, you must set up an account ("Account") by completing the Account set-up process required by the Site and providing accurate and complete information about yourself.  If you choose to submit articles for the chance to earn money, you must also agree to our Supplemental Terms of Use and complete the required tax forms which ask for information that we must collect to fulfill our tax reporting responsibilities. The tax reporting information includes name (and business name, if any), address, social security number (or employer ID number, if applicable) and country of residence.</p>  

                    <p>You agree to provide, maintain and update true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by our registration processes (the "Registration Data"). If you provide any information that does not satisfy this provision, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect as much, we have the right to suspend or terminate your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of any portion thereof operated by any of our corporate affiliates.</p>

                    <p>In posting to our site, you agree not to provide PII or confidential or sensitive information relating to, or controlled by third parties unless: (1) you have obtained any required permission to do so under applicable law and, (2) for PII relating to someone other than you, you have informed the person whose data will be included that their PII will be subject to this Policy and you have obtained their consent to this Policy. You must do this even if an inability to obtain permission means that you cannot submit Content or other information. By providing information to us, you represent and warrant that you have made all required disclosures and obtained all required permissions</p>
                    
                    <p>We may highlight content you submit on the Site such as reviews, comments, or articles.</p>
                    <p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily provide information in public areas of the Site, such as the user profile pages or forums,  that information can be viewed and possibly used by others. We therefore advise visitors not to disclose contact information, including phone number, email address, street address or instant messenger address (within these public areas) that they do not wish to share.  We are not responsible for PII you choose to submit in these forums or pages.</p>
                    <p>We also may use your PII to contact you regarding your Account, such as to inform you that content you submit has been accepted or rejected for posting, or to forward to you user comments about the Content you have posted.  We may also email eHow messages of the day, newsletters, and similar communications about the Site.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Automatic Information:
            <p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us and the Site. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our sites. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. We use persistent, identifying cookies to remember your information and to link your activities to you.</p>
            
            <p>Our cookies collect at least the following: 
                </p><ul>
                    <li><p>the domain name and host from which you access the Internet and the Internet address of the site from which you direct-linked to ours;</p></li>
                    <li><p>the date and time you access the Site and pages you visit;</p></li>
                    <li><p>your computer's IP address and information about its operating system, platform and the Web browser type and version you use; and</p></li>
                    <li><p>information to combat fraud or misuse.</p></li>
                </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>In addition, our cookies may house demographic and other non-personally identifiable profile information about you.</p>
            <p>While you can take steps to warn of, block or disable cookies, if you do, the Site won't function and/or appear as we have designed it. Nonetheless, if you want to take these steps, you can do so by following the instructions associated with your particular browser.</p>
            <p>In our e-mails to you, we use "pixel tags" to determine if your email software or service can display html-formatted e-mail (this helps us optimize the size of our e-mail messages and conserve bandwidth). Some of the businesses that place advertisements and other content on our Site may use cookies on our site. If you click on an advertisement, for example, a cookie might be placed on your computer. However, we have no access to or control over these companies, their privacy policies or their cookies, and their practice and policies may change from time to time so you should read their privacy policies and decide whether they are acceptable to you.</p>

            <h2 class="SubHeader">II. Does eHow Share the Information It Receives?</h2>
            <p>In general, we use PII to verify, evaluate, process, respond to, communicate about, investigate and enforce our rights and Content you may submit. We tend to use non-PII for purposes such as measuring the number of visitors to sections of our Site, making our Site more useful to visitors and delivering targeted advertising and non-advertising content. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track a user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
            <p>We do share Information, but only as described below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><span>Advertisers:</span> We will share aggregated demographic information with advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p><span>Service Third Parties:</span> We contract with affiliated and non-affiliated third parties to provide specific services to us or to you on our behalf. Examples include providing marketing assistance, providing customer services, sending eHow postal mail and email to you, removing repetitive information from customer lists, the preparation, filing and distribution of tax forms, and analyzing data. These persons have access to personal information needed to perform their functions (including, without limitation, access to your social security number by tax reporting service providers).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span>Business Transfer:</span> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets, or engage in transfers in acquisitions, mergers, restructuring, changes of control or operations or the like. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets, and your Information may be subject to such a transfer.  We may also share PII, non-PII and other information with our corporate affiliates. Some of our affiliates are identified on the website of our parent company, <a href="http://www.demandmedia.com" target="_blank">Demand Media, Inc.</a>  Corporate affiliates are those entities that we control, are controlled by us, or are under common control with us.  Any use of your information by the other entities identified in this paragraph will be subject to the terms of this Policy or a different policy no less protective of your privacy. For example, information we share with corporate affiliates is not used by our affiliates for direct marketing purposes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span>Compliance:</span> We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law, to respond to legal process; to make disclosures under programs intended to prevent potential crimes or investigate persons; enforce or apply agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of eHow, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Subject to the terms of this Policy, We reserve the right to the following worldwide: use, access (or bar access to), process, disclose, display, share, transfer, store, sell, retain, commingle, investigate, verify, prove and otherwise deal with, voluntarily or as required by law, (collectively "Disclose") all PII, non-PII and other information. We may Disclose the foregoing internally or to third parties or through any databases for any purpose not prohibited by this Policy or, in our discretion, to help prevent or address perceived harm, damage or loss to us or others or to respond to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or other legal process.</p>
            <p>We  generally will retain information for as long as required, allowed or we believe it useful, but do not undertake retention obligations. We may dispose of information in our discretion without notice, subject to applicable law that specifically requires the handling or retention of information. You must keep your own, separate records.</p>

            <h2 class="SubHeader">III. How Secure Is Information About Me?</h2>
			<p>
                </p><ul>
                    <li>
						<p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer or other internet access device. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. Your e-mails to us are not necessarily secure against interception so do not include sensitive information in them - we generally will not ask for passwords or the like in an email and you should assume that if you get such a request, it might be fraudulent.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
						<p>You agree not to enter information on the Site if you (or anyone else whose information you enter) desire a higher level of security than we describe in this Policy or if you have not obtained any appropriate consents.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
						<p>We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect from you. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT GUARANTEE SECURITY. Neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems, and people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. <strong>YOU ASSUME THE RISK OF ANY INADEQUACY OR FAILURE OF SECURITY AND AGREE TO DO WHAT YOU REASONABLY CAN TO PROMOTE SECURITY.</strong> If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty (if any), you agree that the standard used to measure our compliance with that duty will be one of intentional misconduct.</p>
