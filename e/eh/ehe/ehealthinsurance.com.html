<b>SECURITY</b> of the information under our control.&nbsp; Our guidelines for protecting the
information you provide us during a visit to our website appear below.
  <p></p>
  <p>Furthermore, eHealthInsurance is a registered licensee of TRUSTe.&nbsp; TRUSTe is an independent,
non-profit initiative whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by
promoting the principles of full disclosure and informed consent.&nbsp; Because we want to demonstrate
our commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and to have
our privacy practices reviewed and audited for compliance by TRUSTe.&nbsp; These include: </p>

<ul>
<li>What information of yours we collect;</li>

<li>How we use the information;</li>

<li>With whom your personally identifiable information may be shared;</li>

<li>What your choices are regarding collection, use and distribution of the information;</li>

  <p></p>
  <p class="blueheader2">Collection and Use 
    of Information</p>
  <p><b>Personally Identifiable 
    Information</b>. Our site uses an application form for individuals and
businesses to apply online for health insurance.&nbsp; To provide you with a health insurance quote or
to process your application with the health insurance company that you have selected, we collect
your <i>contact information</i> (like your email address and mailing address), <i>personal health
information</i> (like your or your family's medical history), <i>financial information</i>
(like your account or credit card numbers), and <i>demographic information</i> (like your zip code,
gender and state).&nbsp; If you are enrolling your company, <i>employee information</i> is also
collected (like their age, home zip code and family members to be insured).&nbsp; Contact, personal
health, demographic information and/or employee information is required by the health insurance
company to process an application form. Additionally, the financial information will be used by the
insurance company to bill you after you have been approved to be a policy holder.&nbsp;</p>


  <p>Your contact and demographic information may also be used by eHealthInsurance to get in touch
with you when necessary to process your application.&nbsp; Emails will be sent to you throughout the
application process to inform you of the status of your application and additional information that
is requested as part of the application.&nbsp; A postal mailing of your application will be sent to you
if you choose to have us mail you the application for signature and submission of payment. Emails,
postal mailings and telephone calls are made upon your request or as a friendly reminder to submit
your application if we have not received the application for a prolonged period after your online
submission.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Additionally, eHealthInsurance may contact you to survey your satisfaction of our service and/or
to inform you of additional products and services available through our website. To opt-out of
receiving these additional communications from eHealthInsurance, follow the opt-out procedures
below.</p>

  <p><b>Anonymous Information.</b> 
    In addition to the collection and use of <i>personally identifiable
information</i> to provide you with quotes or to process your insurance application,
eHealthInsurance also gathers <i>anonymous information</i> and <i>aggregate demographic
information</i>, which may be used by eHealthInsurance or shared by eHealthInsurance with third
parties.&nbsp; This information does not personally identify you, but it may be helpful to us for
marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer.&nbsp; For example, eHealthInsurance may track
the aggregate number of return visitors to our site or the aggregate number of visitors to our site
that are men, and eHealthInsurance may share this information with its partners and outside
advertisers for general marketing purposes. <b>&nbsp;</b> Generally this information is collected
through “traffic data” and may entail the use of “Cookies,” “Internet
Protocol” addresses or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.&nbsp; Again, disclosure of
anonymous information and/or aggregate demographic information by eHealthInsurance will not reveal
any personally identifiable information about specific users.</p>

  <p>“Cookies” are small files that are stored by your web browser to help a particular
system recognize you and the pages you visited in a website.&nbsp; Our site uses cookies to
make your online experience more convenient. For example, we may use a cookie to store your account information
between sessions and to maintain information about the quotes that you've requested during your
session.&nbsp; Additionally, we may use data from cookies for a variety of internal purposes, such as
studying how users navigate our site.&nbsp; Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you
prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies.&nbsp; Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the
features on our site, including obtaining quotes and purchasing insurance.&nbsp;</p>

    Our site contains links to other sites. Please note that when you click
on one of these links you are "clicking" to another website.&nbsp; eHealthInsurance is not responsible

  <p class="blueheader2">Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information</p>
  <p><b>It is our firm commitment to you that eHealthInsurance will not sell, trade or give away your
personally identifiable or personal health information to anyone, except those specifically

  <li><b>Service Providers.</b> 
    eHealthInsurance may provide your personally identifiable information to
reputable service providers who provide routine services that are an essential element of our

necessary to comply with the law or a valid court order. 
    </li>
</ul>

<p>All personally identifiable information collected in order to provide you with the services on
our site is securely stored in our databases.&nbsp; eHealthInsurance uses leading encryption
technologies to protect personally identifiable information.&nbsp; Information that is passed between
