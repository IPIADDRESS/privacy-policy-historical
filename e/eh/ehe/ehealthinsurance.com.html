            	the page and are much smaller than cookies.  We do not collect any personal information from clear gifs.  
            	Further, no information we collect from clear gifs can be linked back to your personal information. </p>

            <p>Any time you enter or provide personal information in our website, we encrypt it using Secure Socket Layer 
            	("SSL") technology. SSL protects information as it crosses the Internet. To support this technology, you 
            	need an SSL-capable browser. eHealthInsurance recommends using a strong encryption, 128-bit browser 
            	such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher or Netscape Navigator 4.06 or higher. These browsers 
            	will activate SSL automatically whenever you begin shopping for plan on our website and when you return to 
            	our website to complete an application.</p>
              
            <p>You can tell if you are visiting a secure area within a website by looking at the symbol on the bottom of your 
            	browser screen. If you are using Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, you will see either a lock or a key. 
            	When the padlock is in the locked position, your session connection is taking place via a secure server.</p>
            
            <p>If you need a strong encryption browser, you can go to the Microsoft website or the Netscape website to 
            	download the latest Internet Explorer or Navigator browser. We do not recommend the use of beta browser 
            	versions. <br>
