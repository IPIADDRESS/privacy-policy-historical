<p>This eHealthInsurance Privacy Policy discloses the information privacy practices for the website you are currently visiting.</p>

<p>Throughout the policy, we refer to information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, phone number, email address, Social Security number or credit card number, as "personal information." Further, personal information includes any information involving your health or medical history.</p>

<ol>

<li><b>We do not sell, trade or give away your personal information to anyone.</b><br><br></li>

<li><b>We do not disclose your personal information to third parties, unless one of the following limited exceptions applies.</b><br><br>

	<ul>
	<li><b><i>Insurance Companies and Licensed Agents.</i></b> If you submit an application for an insurance product offered by us, then we will disclose your personal information to your chosen insurance company to process your application.  If you submit an application for an insurance product offered through an insurance agent or agency with whom we have associated, then we may disclose your personal information to that agent or agency to process your requested quote or application.  Please be assured that the agent or agency is only allowed to use your personal information to process your requested quote or application and is contractually obligated to maintain strict confidentiality.<br><br></li>
	<li><b><i>Service Providers.</i></b> We may disclose your personal information to other companies that help us process or service your insurance application or correspond with you. For example, we may provide your personal information to a service provider to verify the validity or credit limit of your credit card. Please be assured that the companies we hire to process or service your insurance application or correspond with you are not allowed to use your personal information for their own purposes and are contractually obligated to maintain strict confidentiality.<br><br></li>
	<li><b><i>Legal Obligations.</i></b> We may disclose or report your personal information when we believe, in good faith, that the disclosure is required or permitted under law, for example, to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities or to resolve consumer disputes.<br><br></li>

<p><a name="cookies" class="bluebold">“Cookies”</a></p>

<p>“Cookies” are small files that are stored by your web browser to help a particular system recognize you and the pages you visited in a website. Our website uses cookies to make your online experience more convenient. For example, we may use a cookie to store your account information between sessions and to maintain information about the quotes you've requested during your session. Additionally, we may use data from cookies for a variety of internal purposes, such as studying how users navigate our website. We do not collect any personal information from cookies. Further, no other information we collect from cookies can be linked back to your personal information. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features on our website, including obtaining quotes and applying for an insurance policy.</p>


<p><a name="browsers" class="bluebold">Browsers and Internet Security</a></p>

<p>Any time you enter or provide personal information in our website, we encrypt it using Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology. SSL protects information as it crosses the Internet. To support this technology, you need an SSL-capable browser. eHealthInsurance recommends using a strong encryption, 128-bit browser such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher or Netscape Navigator 4.06 or higher. These browsers will activate SSL automatically whenever you begin shopping for  plan on our website and when you return to our website to complete an application.</p>

<p>You can tell if you are visiting a secure area within a website by looking at the symbol on the bottom of your browser screen. If you are using Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, you will see either a lock or a key. When the padlock is in the locked position, your session connection is taking place via a secure server.</p>

<p>If you need a strong encryption browser, you can go to the Microsoft website or the Netscape website to download the latest Internet Explorer or Navigator browser. We do not recommend the use of beta browser versions. </p>


<p><a name="password" class="bluebold">Your Password and Other Security Issues</a></p>


<p>The password you enter when you begin an application on our website is your private entry key into your application. You should never share it with anyone.</p>

<p>Your password must be between 6-20 digits and/or letters long.</p>

<p>If you forget your password, we can send your password through email (provided that you gave us your email address as your user ID when you created an account on our website) or we can help you retrieve your password by calling us toll free at 800-977-8860.</p>

<p><a name="risk" class="bluebold">Security Risk of Using Non-Approved Automated Software Applications</a></p>

<p>For security reasons to guard the safety of your data, access to this website is limited to SSL-capable browsers such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher or Netscape Navigator 4.06 or higher. Under no circumstance should you use any software, program, application or any other device to access or log-in to the eHealthInsurance website, or to automate the process of obtaining, downloading, transferring or transmitting any content to or from our computer systems, website or proprietary software.</p>

<p><a name="websites" class="bluebold">Links to Other Websites</a></p>

            <p>Our website contains links to other websites. Please note that when you click on one of these links you are "clicking" to another website. eHealthInsurance is not responsible for the information privacy practices or the content of such websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these linked websites as their information privacy practices may differ from ours.<br>
