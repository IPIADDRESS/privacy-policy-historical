<h1>eHelp Corporation Privacy Statement</h1>
<p>eHelp Corporation ("eHelp") has created this privacy statement 
  in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. This document describes 
  eHelp’s practices with respect to the collection of user information from this 
  website and the use and disclosure of such information.&nbsp; This document only 
  applies to the eHelp site <a href="http://www.ehelp.com/">www.eHelp.com</a> 
  and does not address the privacy of information we obtain from places other 
  than our website.&nbsp; In addition, other sites on the web (including those we link 
  to) have their own practices; in all cases we encourage you to ask questions 
  and to provide data only to sites whose practices you understand and trust. 
</p>
<p><b>Information collected and how it’s used</b></p>
<p>eHelp collects user information to make it easier and more 
  rewarding for you to use our site.&nbsp; We collect non-personally identifying information 
  about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your 
  IP address or most-recently-visited URL or through "cookies". (For more information 
  on IP addresses or Cookies, please see the appropriate sections below).&nbsp; We 
  use such information to tailor the content, services and advertising on our 
  websites to your current and future needs.&nbsp; Non-personally identifying information 
  might include the type of browser you use, the type of computer, the operating 
  system, the Internet service provider and other similar information.&nbsp; We use 
  such information in the aggregate to understand how our users as a group use 
  the services and resources provided on our site.&nbsp; This way we know which areas 
  of our site are the most popular, which areas need improvement, and what technologies 
  are being used so that we may continually improve our site. </p>
<p>We do not collect any personally identifying information 
  about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us.&nbsp; We request 
  such information when you register for mailing lists/contests/promotions, download 
  our trial software and sample projects, register your software or submit a request 
  for technical support. You will be asked to provide the personal information 
  that we deem necessary to complete or participate in your selected activity. 
  An eHelp sales representative may call you to determine if you are interested 
  in other eHelp products.&nbsp; Such representative may ask you if you would like 
  to receive additional information on our products and services.&nbsp; If you are 
  not interested, please advise the eHelp sales representative accordingly, and 
  you will not be contacted again by eHelp.&nbsp; From time to time, we may notify 
  you about new products and services we are offering.&nbsp; If you do not want to 
  receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. 
</p>
<p>In addition, in connection with an assignment, sale, joint 
  venture or other&nbsp; transfer or disposition of some or all of the assets of the 
  eHelp Corporation or its affiliated entities to third party successors in interest, 
  you acknowledge and agree that we can accordingly assign, sell, license or transfer 
  any information, including personally identifying information, that our visitors 
  have provided to us to such third parties.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
<p>Cookies are small text files that are written to your computer.&nbsp; 
  They make our website easier for you to use because they save your preferences 
  while you’re at our site (although we do not save your passwords in cookies).&nbsp; 
  Cookies contain information that the server computer "knew" in the first place, 
  and are designed to only be read by the serving domain that placed them.&nbsp; Cookies 
  are a standard part of Internet use and allow server computers to recognize 
  your computer’s browser when you return to our site.&nbsp; For example, a cookie 
  may retain information regarding items that remain in your shopping cart when 
  you leave our site so that you don’t have to start your shopping again from 
  scratch when you return. The non-personally identifying information that we 
  track with cookies is anonymous and is not used to identify, or lead us back 
  to, any particular visitor.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Most browsers are set to accept cookies.&nbsp; You can set your 
  browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent.&nbsp; If 
  you elect not to accept cookies, please note that some parts of the eHelp site, 
  such as shopping, contests or games, may not function properly, or at all, or 
  may be considerably slower.</p>
<p><b>IP Address</b></p>
<p>An IP address is a number that’s automatically assigned to 
  your computer whenever you’re using the worldwideweb.&nbsp; Web servers – the big 
  computers that "serve up" web pages – automatically identify your computer by 
  its IP address.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our site, 
  track users’ movements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate 
  use.&nbsp; IP addresses are not normally linked to personally identifying information.&nbsp; 
  This means that a visitor’s session will be logged, but the visitor remains 
  anonymous to us. </p>
<p><b>Disclosure of Information</b></p>
<p>As part of the registration process, eHelp may provide you 
  with the option of receiving information from third parties.&nbsp; If you select 
  this option, eHelp will transfer your contact information to third parties.&nbsp; 
  If you do not want to receive information from third parties in the future, 
  call the eHelp Customer SupportDepartment at 1-800-358-9370.&nbsp; (Please note that 
  eHelp is not responsible for removing your information from third party lists 
  or entities with which you have previously authorized eHelp to share your information.)&nbsp; 
  You will need to contact those third parties directly to request removal from 
  their lists.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Unless we tell you otherwise, we do not sell or rent your 
  personally identifying information to any third parties. We will notify you 
  at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with 
  a third party and you will have the option of not permitting the transfer.&nbsp; 
  If you do not wish your data to be shared, you can choose not to use a particular 
  service or not to participate in certain promotions or contests. </p>
<p>We do sell and rent aggregated information about our users 
  generally to our advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. 
  We also may produce aggregated reports for advertisers identifying, for example, 
  the number of users that visit our site or different areas of our site, the 
  number of users that clicked on an advertisement or the number of users that 
  read a particular article.&nbsp; Aggregate information refers to information that 
  cannot be directly linked to a specific individual. For example, we may know 
  that 25,000 people visited our site today, or that 75% of those visitors were 
  women but we don’t know their names. We use aggregate information to customize 
  our content and advertising, to deliver a better experience for our visitors. 
  Aggregated information does <u>not</u> include personally identifying information 
  about you or your use of our site.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Disclosure of Information in Special Circumstances</b></p>
<p>eHelp reserves the right to disclose information in special 
  cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary 
  to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating 
  eHelp’s <a href="/notices/">Terms of Use</a> or may be causing injury to or 
  interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) eHelp’s rights or 
  property, other eHelp users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.&nbsp; 
  eHelp may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith 
  that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem 
  necessary to maintain, service and improve our products and services.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Opt out</b></p>
<p>You can help eHelp maintain the accuracy of your personal 
  information by notifying us when you change your address, phone number or email 
  address. Users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information 
  used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask 
  for the information. For example, our download form has an opt-in option so 
  users who download the trial software from us but don’t want to receive any 
  marketing materials.&nbsp; Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may 
  remove their name from the distribution list at any time by going to <a href="http://www.ehelp.com/unsubscribe">http://www.ehelp.com/unsubscribe</a> 
  and filling out the short form provided with their name and email address or 
  by calling us at 1-800-358-9370.&nbsp; If you have subscribed under more than one 
  email address, you will need to unsubscribe for each of your email addresses.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p standardl1=""><b>Links to other Sites&nbsp; </b></p>
<p standardl1="">Users will find advertising or other content on our site that 
  links to the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, 
  licensors and other third parties.&nbsp; In many cases, the links represent cooperative 
  projects or are mutual links established with persons or entities connected 
  with our site. We do not control the content or links that appear on these third 
  party sites.&nbsp; In addition, these third party sites or services, including their 
  content and links, may be constantly changing.&nbsp; These third party sites and 
  services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies, 
  or no policy at all.&nbsp; We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any 
  third party site or service before providing any of them with your personal 
  information.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left" text-align:left;'=""><b>Minors</b></p>
<p align="left" text-align:left;'="">eHelp’s site is not designed 
  for minors and therefore does not collect or want any personally identifying 
  information from children.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p>Protecting your privacy and your information is a priority 
  at eHelp.&nbsp; We do not rent or sell the personal financial information you provide 
  to us. We use industry-standard methods to protect your personally identifying 
  information from unauthorized access.&nbsp; Among other techniques, we usually store 
  such information on a computer behind our "firewall" in a secure location, and 
  we take measures to restrict the number of employees internally who can access 
  such data.&nbsp; When our registration or order form asks users to enter sensitive 
  information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted and 
  is protected with industry-standard encryption technology – 128-bit encryption 
  SSL.&nbsp; In addition, as an added security measure, if you use a credit card to 
  make a purchase on our site, an eHelp representative may call you to verify 
  the transaction. </p>
<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information 
  online, we also take steps to protect user information off-line.&nbsp; Access to 
  all of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned 
  above, is restricted in our offices.&nbsp; Only employees who need the information 
  to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service 
  representative) are granted access to personally identifying information.&nbsp; Furthermore, 
  employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy policies and practices.&nbsp; 
  Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifying information are 
  kept in a secure environment.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Of course, there is no such thing as "perfect security" on 
  the Internet and no data transmission can be guaranteed to be secure.&nbsp; As a 
  result, while we strive to protect your personal information, eHelp cannot and 
  does not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us 
  or via our site, and you do so at your own risk.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Passwords&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>In the near future, your eHelp account information will be 
  password-protected so that only you are authorized to access this personal information. 
  &nbsp;Once the password system is instituted on our site, we recommend that you do 
  not divulge your password to anyone.&nbsp; eHelp will not ask for your password in 
  an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. </p>
<p><b>Amendments</b>&nbsp; </p>
<p>We may change this policy from time to time to address new 
  issues and reflect changes on our site.&nbsp; We will post those changes here (and 
  such changes become effective upon posting) so that you will know what information 
  we collect, how we might use that information, and whether we disclose that 
  information to anyone.&nbsp; Please refer back to this policy regularly. </p>
<p><b>Your Acceptance of these Terms</b>&nbsp; </p>
<p>By accessing and using the eHelp site, you signify your agreement 
  to and acceptance of our Privacy Policy.&nbsp; If you do not agree to this policy, 
  please do not access or use our site.&nbsp; Your continued use of the eHelp site 
  following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean that you accept 
  those changes.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Additional Information&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please 
  contact our Customer Support Department by phone 1-800-358-9370 or email <a href="mailto:customer_support@ehelp.com">customer_support@ehelp.com</a>.
