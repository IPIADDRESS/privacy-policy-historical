   <strong>
    Part 5: How eHealthMe Handles Privacy and Security Internally
   </strong>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Listed below are some of the security procedures that eHealthMe uses to
  protect your privacy:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Requires both a personal username (log-in name) and a password in
    order for users to access their Personally Identifiable Information
    or Personal Health Information.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    No Personally Identifiable Information is disclosed on eHealthMe
    website.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Closely monitors the limited number of eHealthMe employees who have
    potential access to your Personally Identifiable Information.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Requires all eHealthMe employees to abide by our Privacy Policy and
    to be subject to disciplinary action if they violate it.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Backs-up our systems to protect the integrity of your Personally
    Identifiable and Personal Health Information.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Despite eHealthMe's efforts to protect your Personally Identifiable
  Information and Personal Health Information, there is always some risk that
  an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or
  that transmissions of your information over the Internet may be
  intercepted.

  <em><strong>Part 8: Glossary</strong></em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>browser:</strong>
  Short for web browser, a browser is a software application used to locate
  and display web (Internet) pages. In addition, most modern browsers can
  present multimedia information, including sound and video, though they
  require plug-ins for some formats.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>cache (also called cache memory):</strong>
  Once your Web browser accesses a web page, it references that page and the
  graphics on it within your computer's "cache" (or more simply, your
  computer takes a "snapshot" of every page you visit and stores it in the
  "cache".) The next time you visit that same page, your download time will
  be quicker as the images and much of the page is already available on your
  computer for your browser to reference instantly instead of waiting for the
  page and images to download again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>Click Stream Information:</strong>
  A record of all the pages you have visited during your visit to a
  particular Web site or the services you accessed from the site or from an
  email. Click Stream Information is associated with your browser and not
  with you personally. It records the archives of your browser.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>Cookie:</strong>
  A small data file that is stored on the hard drive of the computer you use
  to view a Web site. Cookies are placed by that site or by a third party
  with a presence on the site, and are accessible only by the party or site
  that placed the Cookie (i.e. a Cookie placed on your computer by eHealthMe
  isn't accessed by any other site you visit but a Cookie placed on your
  computer by a third party may be accessed by any site on which that same
  party has a presence). Cookies can contain pieces of Personally
  Identifiable Information (PII). These Cookies often are used to make the
  site easier to use.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>Non-Personal Information:</strong>
  Information that is not traceable back to any individual and cannot be used
  to identify an individual. For example, Click Stream Information is
  Non-Personal Information, as is information such as gender, age, city and
  state when not linked with other Personally Identifiable Information.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>Opt-In:</strong>
  Means you are actively indicating your preference to participate in a
  program, email, feature, tool, or enhancement on a Web site. Typically, if
  you "Opt-in" you must provide certain information, usually Personally
  Identifiable Information, to the Web site or otherwise actively indicate
  your choice or preference to participate in the Web site program.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>Opt-Out:</strong>
  Means that if you do not take some action you are indicating your
  preference to participate in a program, email, feature, tool or enhancement
  on a Web site.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>Personal Health Information (PHI):</strong>
  When your Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is combined with known
  health characteristics. For example, if you indicated that you have a
  certain disease or condition, when that information is combined with your
  PII, it becomes Personal Health Information.

  <strong>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</strong>
  (also called Personal Information): Information that can be traced back to
  an individual (contrast with Non-Personal Information and Aggregate
  Information). Examples of PII include your name, home address, telephone
  number, email address, and Social Security number. eHealthMe does not
  collect Social Security number.
 </p>
 <p>
  If other pieces of information are linked to PII, they also become PII. For
  example, if you use a nickname to chat online and give out your real name
  while chatting, your nickname becomes PII when linked with other PII.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>server:</strong>
  A computer that provides services to other computers. A "web server" stores
  web site files and "serves" them to people who request them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>virus:</strong>
  A program or piece of code that is loaded onto your computer without your
  knowledge and runs against your wishes. Viruses can also "replicate"
  themselves by copying their code to other computers. All computer viruses
  are manmade. A simple virus that can make a copy of itself over and over
  again is relatively easy to produce. Even such a simple virus is dangerous
  because it will quickly use all available memory and bring the system to a
  halt. An even more dangerous type of virus is one capable of transmitting
  itself across networks and bypassing security systems.

  <strong>
   web beacons (also often referenced as "clear GIFs", "web bugs", "1-by-1
   GIFs", "Single-Pixel GIFs", "1 x 1 Pixels", or "clear Pixels"):
  </strong>
  Tiny graphic image files, imbedded in a web page in GIF, jpeg or HTML
  format, typically used to monitor activity on a web page and send back to
  its home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or
  some other third party) information from your browser, such as the IP
  address, the URL of the page on which the beacon is located, the type
  browser that is accessing the site and the ID number of any Cookies on your
  computer previously placed by that server. Web Beacons can also be used to
  place a Cookie on your computer.
