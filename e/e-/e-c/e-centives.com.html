<h1>CouponNetwork Privacy Policy - Your Privacy Rights</h1>
<p>
	Catalina Marketing Corporation and its subsidiaries ("Catalina Marketing" or "we" or "us") are dedicated
	to providing shopper-driven communications, developed and distributed for consumer packaged goods
	manufacturers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, marketers and retailers (collectively, "clients").
	Under the CouponNetwork brand, Catalina Marketing provides certain promotional offer and other services
	and benefits to consumers.  This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected at or in connection
	with couponnetwork.com and the CouponNetwork program, and other web sites operated by Catalina Marketing
	where this Privacy Policy is posted (collectively, "the Sites"). This Privacy Policy explains what
	information is collected on the Sites, how we use your information, and your choices.
	It does not apply to information Catalina Marketing might collect at other Catalina websites,
	including catalinamarketing.com; that we collect from our international web sites, such as
	catalinamarketing.it; information we collect through our client relationships, which are typically
	governed by contract with each client; or information we might collect in other forums, including offline,
	by email, or by text message.
</p>
<p>
	For information collected offline through our client relationships, please note that we do not collect
	or store names, email addresses, street addresses or phone numbers.  For more information about
	information collected offline through our client relationships, please visit
	<a href="http://catalinamarketing.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://catalinamarketing.com/privacypolicy/</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>MODIFICATIONS TO THIS POLICY</strong></p>
<p>
	To the extent required by law, we will notify you of material changes to this Privacy Policy,
	including by posting the most recent version of the Privacy Policy and information about the changes
	from the previous version on the Sites.  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, as your use of the
	Sites indicates to us that you have read and accept our privacy practices, as outlined in this
	Privacy Policy.  In addition, please review our <a href="/terms/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Terms of Use</a>
	which govern your use of the Sites.  By providing us with information and by using the Sites, you consent
	to have your information used as described in this Privacy Policy and you agree to adhere to the Terms.
</p>
<p><strong>COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>
	We collect and maintain a variety of personally identifiable information in connection with our
	operation of the Sites and the CouponNetwork program, including, email addresses, phone numbers,
	as well as demographic information.  We collect information directly from you, for example through
	online registration forms for our CouponNetwork program.  We may combine the information you provide
	with additional information we may have about you (for example, information we have obtained through
	our client relationships), or that may be shared with us by third parties (for example, stores with whom
	you hold a loyalty card).  This information may include purchase preferences. In addition, we gather
	information about you that is automatically collected by our web server, such as your IP address and
	domain name. Your browser also provides us the web site you come from (known as the referring URL),
	the type of browser and computer you use, the time and date of access, and other information that does
	not personally identify you.  Cookies and log files are technologies used by the Sites to identify a
	user as he/she moves through our Sites. Your browser allows us to place some information
	(session based IDs and/or persistent cookies) on your computer's hard drive that identifies the computer
	you are using. We may use cookies to personalize our Sites and to track your usage across other sites.
	Your Web browser can be set to allow you to control whether you will accept cookies, reject cookies,
	or to notify you each time a cookie is sent to you. If your browser is set to reject cookies, Web sites
	that are cookie-enabled will not recognize you when you return to the Web site, and some Web site
	functionality may be lost. The Help section of your browser will tell you how to prevent your browser
	from accepting cookies. Pixel tags, sometimes called Web beacons, are similar in function to a cookie.
	But because of their insignificant size, it is not visible; though, they may be used to pass certain
	information to our servers to personalize our Sites and to track your usage across other of our Sites.
	In addition, we may also use pixel tags in our HTML based e-mails.
</p>
<p>
	We may associate your personally identifiable information with cookies or other tracking utilities our
	Site places on your computer's hard drive. Associating a cookie with your contact data allows us to offer
	increased personalization and functionality. Without cookies, this functionality would not be possible.
	From time to time, we may use tracking mechanisms such as cookies or web beacons to observe your behavior
	across multiple websites. We share the information we gather with third parties who serve targeted
	advertisements to you based on your browsing behaviors.  These advertisements are served to you on
	multiple third party websites.  Additionally, on the Sites, there may be certain third-party advertisers
	whose advertisements contain cookies that collect data from you.  Some of those cookies may contain
	tracking mechanisms that observe your behavior across multiple Sites.  Catalina Marketing does not
	control the use of cookies by advertisers or third parties displaying data on the Sites or on the sites
	you visit using links from the Sites.  We and some of our vendors may use DART cookies, a DoubleClick
	product, which you can opt out of by visiting http://www.doubleclikc.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx.
</p>
<p><strong>USE, SHARING, AND RETENTION OF INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>
	We use personally identifiable information for the purposes described at the time of collection or
	as otherwise described to you and to process requests.  We also use your information, as permitted by law,
	to provide you with information about Catalina Marketing, CouponNetwork, other of our brands or products
	and services, our partners' and/or clients' products and services, or other product and services in which
	we believe you may be interested, or for other legitimate Catalina Marketing business purposes.
	We may also use your personally identifiable information, or other information we maintain about you
	(including information we obtain or gather about your purchase preferences) to tailor your experience at
	the Sites; to compile, display and/or provide you with content, coupons, offers or other information in
	which we think you might be interested; as requested or required by our business partners; or as
	otherwise permitted by law.  We also gather aggregate data about visitors to our Sites for market
	analysis. We may provide information from our Sites in aggregate form, with identifying information
	removed, to third parties.  Please note that with respect to any personal information such third parties
	may collect from you independent of us and outside the scope of Sites maintained by us on our servers,
	we will have no control over the use of such information by such third parties and the use and gathering
	of such data will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies on the respective web sites.
</p>
<p>
	When you visit our Sites there may be an opportunity for you to participate in one or more surveys.
	Your participation in any survey is completely voluntary. During the survey, we may ask you to provide
	basic contact information in addition to responding to the questions within the survey itself. Many of
	our surveys will include the opportunity to earn prizes for participating. If you win one of the prizes,
	we may share your contact information with a third party for fulfillment and delivery of your prize.
</p>
<p>
	In addition, we may share personally identifiable information with third parties for legitimate business purposes, including for the following reasons or in the following circumstances:
	</p><ul class="list">
  	<li>
  		Companies and people who work for us: Because we are a large company, we contract with other
  		companies and individuals to help us provide services. For example, we may host some of our websites
  		on another company's computers, hire technical consultants to maintain our applications, or work with
  		companies to analyze data, provide marketing assistance, and provide customer service. These other
  		companies may have access to some of the personal information we maintain about our users or employees.
  		Other companies may collect information on our behalf through their sites. This occasionally
  		incorporates the use of frames on the Sites that will not show the URL you are visiting in the
  		browser address window.<br><br>
   		Promotional and informational offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of shoppers.
   		To accomplish this we may use third parties working on behalf of Catalina Marketing.
   	</li>
  	<li>
  		Business transfers: We may share personally identifiable information in anticipation of and in
  		the course of an actual or potential sale, reorganization, consolidation, merger, or amalgamation of
  		all or part of our business or operations.
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		Legal purposes: We may share personal information when we believe it is necessary to cooperate with
  		law enforcement or in response to a government request, including if specifically requested or
  		required, as otherwise permitted by law, to investigate potentially fraudulent or questionable
  		activities, and for other valid Catalina Marketing business purposes.
  	</li>
	</ul>
<p>
	We also may use your personal information on an aggregated basis to provide third parties with information,
	such as to help us develop new features and content for the Sites, and to provide others with aggregate
	information about our users and the usage patterns of the Sites.
</p>
<p>
	We retain personally identifiable information for as long as necessary for its legitimate business
	purposes, and as otherwise permitted by applicable law.
</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>
	We use reasonable measures to safeguard sensitive personally identifiable information, which measures
	are appropriate to the type of information maintained, and follows applicable laws regarding safeguarding
	any such information under our control.
</p>
<p>
	We cannot guarantee, however, that your information will remain secure.  The Internet by its nature is
	a public forum, and we encourage you to use caution when disclosing information online. Often, you are
	in the best situation to protect yourself online.  You are responsible for protecting your username and
	password from third party access, and for selecting passwords that are secure.
</p>
<p><strong>LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SITES</strong></p>
<p>
	From time to time, we will provide links to third-party web sites, or advertisements will contain links
	to third-party sites.  For example, we may link to a third party who is assisting in or is providing
	online training services.  These links are provided as a service to you.  These sites are operated by
	independent entities that have their own privacy policies.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to such
	other sites or to the use that those entities make of your information. Catalina Marketing has no control
	over the content displayed on such sites, nor over the measures, if any, that are taken by such sites to
	protect the privacy of your information.
</p>
<p><strong>YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS RELATING TO CERTAIN INFORMATION DISCLOSURES</strong></p>
<p>
	If you have an established business relationship with us you may request from us a list of the categories
	of personal information we have disclosed to third parties for those third parties' marketing purposes,
	and a list of all third parties to whom we have shared that information. We will include in that list
	the names and addresses of the third parties who received the information and used it
	(or who we believe may have used it) for their own marketing purposes.
</p>
<p>
	To exercise your rights, you may make one request each year by writing us at the
	address listed in the "How to Contact Catalina Marketing and Modify Your Information Preferences" section
	below. Indicate in your letter that you are making a "Shine the Light" inquiry. Responses to requests
	sent to this email address or the mailing address listed below will be provided within 30 days.
</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO CONTACT US AND MODIFY YOUR INFORMATION OR PREFERENCES </strong></p>
<p>
	You can always contact us in order to (i) update the personal information that you have provided to us,
	and (ii) change your preferences with respect to marketing contacts by using <a href="/account/unsubscribe"> this form</a> or if available also
	logging into your account to update your information.  If you would like to modify the types of
	marketing email or text messages you receive from us, you may do so by following the instructions
