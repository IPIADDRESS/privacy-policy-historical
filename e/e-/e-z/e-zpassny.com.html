</p><p><span class="content"><span class="contentbold">Information Collected When You E-mail this Website or Initiate an Online Transaction </span><br>
During your visit to this website you may send an email or submit a feedback form to the Authorities and Xerox.  If 
so, the Authorities and Xerox will collect your e-mail address and the contents of your message. The information 
collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video and graphic information formats included 
in the message.  The Authorities and Xerox may use your e-mail address and the information included in your message 
to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to improve this website, or to forward your message to another 
State agency or authority for appropriate action.  The Authorities and Xerox do not collect your e-mail address for 
commercial purposes and the Authorities and Xerox do not sell or otherwise disclose your e-mail address for commercial 
purposes.</span>
</p><p><span class="content">During your visit to this website you may initiate a transaction such as opening an 
<i>E-ZPass</i>® account or viewing and modifying an existing <i>E-ZPass</i>® account. The Authorities and Xerox may use the 
information, including personal information, that you volunteered by initiating the transaction to open, operate 
and maintain your <i>E-ZPass</i>® account, such as periodic notices, correspondence and statements. The Authorities and 
Xerox may disclose such information for those purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms 
of the transaction in connection with which the information was submitted.</span>
</p><p><span class="content">The Authorities and Xerox do not knowingly collect personal information from children or 
create profiles of children through this website.  Users are cautioned, however, that the Authorities and Xerox will 
treat personal information submitted in an e-mail or transaction as though it was submitted by an adult, and such 
information may, unless exempted from access by federal or State law, be subject to public access.  The Authorities 
and Xerox strongly encourage parents and teachers to be involved in children’s Internet activities and to provide 
guidance whenever children are asked to provide personal information online.</span>
</p><p><span class="content"><span class="contentbold">Information and Choice</span><br>
As noted above, the Authorities and Xerox do not collect any personal information about you during your visit to 
this website unless you provide that information voluntarily by sending an email, submitting an online form, or 
initiating an online transaction such as opening an <i>E-ZPass</i>® account or viewing and modify an existing <i>E-ZPass</i>® 
account.  You may choose not to send the Authorities and Xerox an e-mail, submit an online form or initiate an online 
transaction.  While your choice not to participate in these activities may limit your ability to receive specific 
services or products through this website, it will not prevent you from requesting services or products from the 
Authorities and Xerox by other means and will not normally have an impact on your ability to take advantage of other 
features of the website, including browsing or downloading publicly available information.</span>
</p><p><span class="content"><span class="contentbold">Disclosure of Information Collected Through This Website </span><br>
For the New York Authorities, and Xerox when acting on behalf of the New York Authorities, the collection of 
information through this website and the disclosure of that information are subject to the provisions of the New 
York State Internet Security and Privacy Act.  The Authorities and Xerox will only collect personal information 
through this website or disclose personal information collected through this website if the user has consented to 
the collection or disclosure of such personal information.  The user’s participation in an online transaction 
resulting in the disclosure of personal information to the Authorities and Xerox, whether solicited or unsolicited, 
constitutes consent to the Authorities’ and Xerox’ collection and disclosure of the information for the purposes for 
which the user disclosed the information to the Authorities and Xerox, as was reasonably ascertainable from the 
nature and terms of the transaction.</span>
</p><p><span class="content">However, the Authorities and Xerox may collect or disclose personal information without user

necessary for the Authorities to operate a program authorized by law, or authorized by state or federal statute or 
regulation; (2) made pursuant to a court order, subpoena or by law; (3) for the purpose of validating the identity 
of the user; or (4) of information to be used solely for statistical purposes that is in a form that cannot be used
