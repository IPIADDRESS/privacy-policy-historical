			<a href="#tab-1" class="tab">The Information We Collect and How We Use It</a>

			<div class="content">
              <p>Our site's registration form requires you to give us enrollment contact information (your full name, postcode, date of birth, email address, and number of <nobr>emails</nobr> desired to be received in a week). This information is compulsory to be able to register you as a Member of the <nobr>Research Now</nobr> program. If you fail to provide this information, you will be unable to enroll in the <nobr>Research Now</nobr> program.</p>
              
              <p>However, it is optional for you to provide demographic profile data (like occupation, travel frequency, and areas of interest). Failing to provide this information will not preclude you from participating in the <nobr>Research Now</nobr> program; however, it is encouraged so you can receive a more personalized experience on our site. Specifically, we use this data to customize and tailor your experience with the <nobr>Research Now</nobr> program, the application
						
						  
                    and website, showing you content in which you may be interested and displaying content according to your preferences. Additionally, we use this data to enable the fielding of market research studies and reserve the right to share it in anonymous singular summary and aggregate form with third parties for this purpose.</p>

                       <p>Personal demographic and profile data regarding our Members is only shared with our Partners and other third parties on an anonymous singular summary basis or an aggregate basis. Anonymous singular summary information is data that describes the interest profile and demographics data of a <nobr>Research Now</nobr> Member without specifically identifying the Member. For example, this data does not contain personally identifying information such as a name or email address, nor does the combination of data make it possible to identify you. Aggregate information is data that describes the interest profiles and demographics of <nobr>Research Now</nobr> Members as a group (in the aggregate) without specifically identifying any single Member who helps comprise that group. This data also does not contain personally identifying information such as a name or email address but describes group interest profiles (for example, car brand preferences of <nobr>Research Now</nobr> Members as a group) and group demographic information (for example, the average age of <nobr>Research Now</nobr> Members as a group).</p>

                       <p>When our Partners, our Reward Partners, our Panel Partners, our Marketing Partners, our Clients and other third parties receive personally identifiable information from <nobr>Research Now,</nobr> they are required to sign legally binding agreements that hold them accountable to the Council of American Survey Research Organization's ("CASRO") "Standards Regarding Disclosure of Respondent-Identifiable Data to Clients." By entering into this agreement with <nobr>Research Now,</nobr> our Partners, our Panel Partners, our Marketing Partners, our Rewards Partners, our Clients and other third parties agree that their use of survey response data will be limited to research purposes and that all personally identifiable information will remain confidential.

Again, you are not required to provide us with this information if you do not want to and failing to provide this information will not preclude you from participating in the <nobr>Research Now</nobr> program.
