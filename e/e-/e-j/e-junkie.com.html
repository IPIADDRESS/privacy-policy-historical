      <p>INFORMATION E-junkie.com GATHERS AND TRACKS</p>
      <p>E-junkie.com gathers two types of information about users:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. 
          These are voluntary submissions like registration, to receive our electronic 
          newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to email 
          a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys.</li>
        <li>Information E-junkie.com gathers through aggregated tracking information 
          derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our site. Our web server(s) 
          log IP address and visitor's domain name. The domain name and IP address 
          reveal nothing personal about the visitor. This information maybe be 
          used for purposes such as examining traffic and to investigate misuse 
          or abuse of any aspect of this site. This information is stored in a 
          protected area of the site's logs and may be shared at 19.5 Degrees's 
          discretion with appropriate law-enforcement bodies or in good faith 
          with other third parties. We do not collect and evaluate this information 
          for specific individuals. Our Web servers do not automatically record 
          e-mail addresses of the visitors. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>E-junkie.com Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:</p>
      <p>Optional Voluntary Information<br>
        We offer the following services, which require some type of voluntary 
        submission of personal information by users:</p>
      <p>1. E-mail notifications<br>
        We will send out notifications about payments and other activity related 
        to your account. You might also receive periodic notifications about the 
        changes in features for as long as you a registered member of E-junkie.com. 
        You may cancel your account by contacting us from http://www.e-junkie.com/ej/contact.php</p>
      <p><br>
        2. Electronic newsletters (Dispatches)<br>
        We will offer a electronic newsletter to users. E-junkie.com gathers the 
        email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves 
        from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter 
        that points users to the subscription management page. Users can also 
        subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration.</p>
      <p>3. Message boards/forums<br>
        Users of the site’s Message Boards and Forums must register separately 
        for these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages, 
        although they needn't register to visit the site. During registration 
        the user is required to supply a username, password, and email address.</p>
      <p>4. “E-mail this to a friend" Service<br>
        Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents 
        to someone else by clicking “e-mail this to a friend”. The user 
        must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This 
        information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, 
        to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used 
        for any other purpose.</p>
      <p>5. Polling<br>
        We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their 
        opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important 
        issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not 
        identifiable to any particular user. E-junkie.com may use a system to 
        "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once 
        on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information 
        about individual users.</p>
      <p>6. Surveys<br>
        E-junkie.com may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our 
        content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic 
        information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. 
        <br>
        Children<br>
        Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 
        1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable 
        information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental 
        consent.<br>
        Usage tracking<br>
        E-junkie.com tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. 
        However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual 
        users. E-junkie.com does break down overall usage statistics according 
        to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information 
        from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).<br>
        E-junkie.com sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users 
        enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with 
        individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas 
        of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. 
        We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page 
        performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for 
        you.</p>
      <p><br>
        USE OF INFORMATION<br>
        E-junkie.com uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance 
        their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive 
        or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content 
        based on the interests of our users.<br>
        As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in 
        order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate 
        in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters 
        to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and 
        occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might 
        be particularly interested in something we are doing. When we use tracking 
        information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't 
        like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual 
        users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps 
        us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered 
        in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. 
        But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.<br>
        E-junkie.com creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic 
        patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers 
        to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements 
        that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns 
        of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific 
        user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any 
        individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process 
        or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</p>
      <p>SHARING OF THE INFORMATION<br>
        E-junkie.com uses the above-described information to tailor our content 
        to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's 
        demographics.</p>
      <p>OPT-OUT POLICY<br>
        We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:<br>
        · Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which 
        completely alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information 
        from our users </p>
      <p>YOUR CONSENT <br>
        By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information 
        by E-junkie.com. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post 
        those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information 
        we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. 
      </p>
      <p>COOKIES<br>
        Some elements of our site may send your computer a Cookie. A Cookie is 
        a very small file which computers use to store information about websites 
        and vice-versa.</p>
      <p>Third party Cookies motioned above are not personally identifiable - 
        that is to say, they do not allow third party advertisers to gain significant 
        personal information about who you are.</p>
      <p>Cookies may be used to identify trends in a user's browsing pattern. 
        Information gathered from visitors' visits to this and/or other sites 
        may be used to determine which advertisements are served on this and/or 
        other sites.</p>
      <p>Visitors may choose not to allow Cookies to be served to their computers 
        as a way of "opting out" of such anonymous identification. Visitors 
        should investigate the functionality of their Internet browser which disallows 
        Cookies. We do not provide technical support for such activities.</p>
      <p>Forum members may be served an additional Cookie which allows their browser 
        to verify their identity at each visit without the user having to manually 
        log in.</p>
      <p>In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party 
        advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your 
        browser.</p>
      <p>REGISTRATION<br>
        Optional registration for site promotions, newsletters, member access 
        areas and the Forums may request additional personal information about 
        a user. This information is stored in a protected area of the site's database 
        and may be shared at 19.5 Degrees's discretion with appropriate law-enforcement 
        bodies or in good faith with other third parties. </p>
      <p>SECURITY AND TERMS OF USE<br>
        This site has stringent security measures in place to protect the loss, 
        misuse and alteration of the information under our control.</p>
      <p>By using our site you consent to the collection and use of information 
        as specified in this policy. Should we decide to alter our Privacy Policy, 
        this page will be updated to reflect those changes in order to keep our 
        visitors in the know.<br>
