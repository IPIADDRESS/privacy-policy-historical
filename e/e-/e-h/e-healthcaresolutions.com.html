<h1>e-Healthcare Solutions Privacy Policy</h1>

<hr width="100%" color="#000000"><br>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
e-Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (e-HS) is committed to protecting the privacy of our users (referred to as either "you" or "Users").  
e-HS uses its best efforts to ensure that the information you submit directly to e-HS via e-HS member web sites 
("affiliated Web Sites") remains private, and is used only for the purposes as set forth herein.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Applicability of Policy</h3>
<p>
This Privacy Statement applies only to information collected from you or submitted by you on participating e-HS 
affiliated Web Sites, where the information is submitted directly to e-HS through a shared portion of page real-estate on a e-HS 
affiliated web-site.  The policy is not applicable to each individual web-site.  Each participating e-HS web-site may have it�s 
own privacy policy, which we encourage you to read and understand.  e-HS has no authority over each web-sites individual 
privacy policy.
</p>
<br> 

<h3>General Information Collected</h3>
<p>
First and foremost, e-HS does not automatically obtain any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, 
address, phone number, or e-mail address, when you visit our affiliated Web sites unless you voluntarily provide such information.  
e-HS may, however, automatically collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as the server your computer 
is logged onto, your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), the Web pages you visited and whether you 
responded to any polls or ad delivered by e-HS on one of the e-HS affiliated Web sites.  This non-personally identifiable 
information collected by e-HS is used for the purpose of improving the e-HS web sites to make them more useful to you and for 
better matching content and some advertised products to your needs. 
</p>
<br> 

<h3>User Specific Information Collection</h3>
<p>
e-HS occasionally asks for personal information that will help us better serve your information needs. 
Whenever e-HS asks for such personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, e-mail address, etc.), we will 
clearly disclose what information is required, what information is optional, and how that information may be used. 
</p>
<br> 

<h3>Limitations on Disclosures</h3>
<p>
Under no circumstances will e-HS ever disclose (to a third party) personal information about individual 
medical conditions, except when required by law or court order. Personally identifiable information in the e-HS 
database will not be sold or disclosed to any merchant, advertiser or Web publisher.  However, e-HS does disclose aggregate 
information, which does not identify individuals or any personally identifiable information, to business partners, 
advertisers and other third parties.  e-HS also reserves the right to use such non-personally identifiable information 
gathered on e-HS web sites for promoting e-HS products and services or the products and services of e-HS advertisers and 
sponsors.  However, users of e-HS Web sites may opt-out of receiving mailings from such advertisers or sponsors.  
e-HS may also record and share aggregate information provided by you to other Internet web sites, which are affiliates or 
partners with the e-HS.  It is your obligation to review their Privacy Statement as well as that of any other partner 
prior to submitting information to a partner or affiliate web site.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
e-HS, along with thousands of other Web sites, uses cookies to enhance your Web viewing experience.  
Cookies are small files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive to collect information about you.  
e-HS cookies do not damage your system or files in any way.  Cookies work as follows.  When you log on to a e-HS Web site, 
e-HS assigns you a unique number and records that number in the cookie file of your computer. Then, when you visit one of 
e-HS Web sites,  e-HS reads this number to help gain information of the user's of its Web sites. The cookie can help 
ensure that the advertisements you see are directed toward you and your needs.  However, the e-HS cookie will not be associated 
with any personal information about you, and e-HS will not be able to identify you personally online. 
</p>
<p>
While we believe that cookies enhance your Web experience with e-HS, you have the option of setting your Web browser to 
reject cookies.  However, doing so may negatively impact the performance of the performance of the Web Sites. 
<br> 
</p>
<h3>Behavioral Targeting</h3>
<p>
We may use an ad network provider to help present advertisements on this
web site. This ad network provider, like other advertising service
vendors, uses cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on the hard
drive of your computer to serve you advertisements tailored to interests
you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, and
to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and
to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, the provider
collects non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating
system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed,
and other clickstream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar
technologies by these ad network providers is subject to their own
privacy policies, not ours. If you do not want the benefits of these
advertising cookies, you may opt-out by visiting
http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp. However, if you do
so you may not receive the full benefit from the use of our site.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Child Privacy</h3>
<p>
e-HS does not specifically or intentionally collect information about children.  If you are concerned about your child's use 
of the Web Sites, you may use web filtering technology to supervise and limit access to the Web Sites.  
</p>
<br>  

<h3>Opt-Out</h3>
<p>
e-HS permits you to opt-out of receiving certain communications from the e-HS.  
To opt-out of receiving targeted communications from the e-HS based on our targeting system, click here.  
Again, each web-site affiliated with the e-HS has it�s own policies and procedures for tracking and targeting messages.  
By opting out of the e-HS targeting, you may still receive targeted ads on e-HS affiliated web-sites if those ads are 
targeted based on a system other than e-HS.  
</p>
<br>  

<h3>Changes to Privacy Statement</h3>
<p>
This Privacy Statement may be updated from time to time.  Changes to this Privacy Statement will be posted by e-HS on the Web 
Sites.  It is your obligation to review this Privacy Statement from time to time, and your continued use of the e-HS 
affiliated Web Sites after changes have been posted will be deemed to be your acceptance of the revised Statement.  
If at any time you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Statement, you may contact e-HS via e-mail at 
<a href="mailto:info@e-healthcaresolutions.com">info@e-healthcaresolutions.com</a>.
</p>
<br>  

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
e-HS will maintain the confidentiality of the information that it collects during your visit to e-HS Web sites.  
e-HS maintains internal practices that help to protect the security and confidentiality of this information by limiting 
employee access to and use of this information. 
</p>
<br>  

<h3>General</h3>
<p>
This Privacy Statement is governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New Jersey, without respect to its 
conflict of laws principles.  Jurisdiction for any claims arising under the terms and conditions of this Privacy Statement 
shall lie exclusively with the state and federal courts of the State of New Jersey.  If any provision of this Privacy 
Statement is found to be invalid by a court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not 
affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Privacy Statement, which shall remain in full force and effect. 
</p>
<p>
If you would like to "opt-out" of receiving targeted information and advertising from the e-HS servers in the future. 
You may do so by clicking here: <a href="http://admin2.digitalhealthcare.com/RealMedia/dhn.cgi?opt_out=yes&amp;redirect=http://www.e-healthcaresolutions.com/optout.php">Opt-me-out</a>.
