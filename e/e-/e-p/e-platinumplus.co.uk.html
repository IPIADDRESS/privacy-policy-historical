    <br>

            	<em>1.1</em><li>We may collect and process the following data about you:</li>
                	<ul class="secondary">
                    	<em>1.1.1</em><li>information that you may provide by filling in online forms and registration forms our "Site", we may also ask you for information in the event you report a problem with our Site;</li>

                    </ul>
            </ul>
    	<li>IP ADDRESSES AND COOKIES</li>
        <p>Please also refer to the <a href="http://post.securecbs.com/cookies.html" target="_blank">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
        	<ul>
            	<em>2.1</em><li>A "cookie" is a small electronic file that collects information when someone visits a website. A cookie can identify the pages that are being viewed, and this can assist us to select the pages that the viewer sees. Some cookies only exist whilst viewers are online, but "persistent" cookies - which are not session-based - remain on the viewer's computer, so that he or she can be recognised as a previous visitor when he or she next visits our Site. This allows us to collect information about a viewer's browsing habits whilst on our Site, and this can be useful in assisting us to monitor and improve our services.</li>
            	<em>2.2</em><li>We do not store sensitive information such as account numbers or passwords in "persistent" cookies, and cookies in themselves, do not contain enough information to identify you. You will only acquire a personal identity in relation to your browsing habits after you have formally provided us with your personal data for the purposes outlined below.</li>
            	<em>2.3</em><li>In addition to using cookies, we might also use web tools to collect information about your browsing activities whilst on our Site. In this respect the information that is provided is similar to the information supplied by cookies, and we use it for the same purposes.</li>
            	<em>2.4</em><li>Any information that we acquire about you using cookies or web tools is subject to the same restrictions and conditions as any other information we collect about you.</li>
            	<em>2.5</em><li>Some of our advertisers may also use cookies or web tools that are set by other people such as advertising agencies, or the businesses to which the advertisements in question relate. We do not have access to any information that might be collected in this way, and, if you are concerned, you should contact the advertiser for more information.</li>
            	<em>2.6</em><li>If you want to delete any cookies already stored on your computer or stop the cookies that keep track of your browsing patterns on the Site you can do so by deleting your existing cookies and/or altering your browser's privacy settings to block third party cookies (the process you follow will differ from browser to browser). If you would like more information on how to do this please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/. Please note that deleting our cookies or disabling our future cookies means that you may not be able to access certain areas or features of the Site.</li>
            </ul>
    	<li>WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</li>
        	<ul>
            	<em>3.1</em><li>CBS employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security of all data. Any data that is stored on CBS's secure servers is treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public. CBS has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, allowing access only to those employees or third parties who have a need to know such information for the purpose of effectively delivering CBS products and services by means of user login and password requirements. CBS routinely evaluates its data security practices to identify security threats or opportunities for improvement.</li>
            	<em>3.2</em><li>No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of CBS to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your data, CBS cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.</li>
            	<em>3.3</em><li>We ask you not to permit anyone to use your name. We will retain your information securely stored for a reasonable period or for as long as the law requires.</li>
            </ul>
    	<li>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</li>
        	<ul>
            	<em>4.1</em><li>We use information held about you in the following ways:</li>

                    </ul>

            </ul>

        	<ul>

                    	<em>6.1.2</em><li>if CBS or substantially all of its assets, are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets; </li>
                    	<em>6.1.3</em><li>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our <a href="http://post.securecbs.com/terms.html">Terms of Use</a> and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of CBS, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>

            </ul>
    	<li>INFORMATION SHARING</li>
        	<ul>
            	<em>7.1</em><li>CBS may make any data provided in response to an advertisement available to the company sponsoring the advertisement, as well as to other trusted third parties in accordance with the terms of this privacy policy.

            	<em>7.2</em><li>CBS and/or our marketing partners may enhance and/or merge data about consumers who have opted-in to receive marketing communications with commercially-available third party data collected from other sources in an effort to ensure that the messages being sent to the consumer in online and/or offline marketing programs are relevant to their interests. We will take reasonable steps to maintain the integrity and quality of that information that we enhance and/or merge with data collected from other sources. </li>
            	<em>7.3</em><li>CBS may share data (including information that has been enhanced with information from other sources) with advertisers, third party marketers and our affiliated entities for their online and/or offline marketing programs. While CBS strongly encourages clients and partners to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, CBS is not responsible for the information practices of clients or their partners. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by clients and partners are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from CBS.</li>
