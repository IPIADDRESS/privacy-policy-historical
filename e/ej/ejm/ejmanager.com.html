<br>
This website ("Site") is owned and operated by eJManagerÂ® International Journal Management and Indexing System ("eJManager", "we", "us" or "our"). <br>
We are committed to maintaining your confidence and trust with respect to the information we collect from you. This privacy policy sets forth what information we collect about you, how we use your information, and the choices you have about how we use your information.<br>
<br>
<b>Collection of Information Provided By Your Browser and Through Use of Cookies</b><br>
<br>
This Site automatically collects information on our server logs from your web browser regarding your use of the Site.

This Site also collects information through the use of "cookies." Cookies are anonymous, unique alphanumeric identifiers sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. The type of information we collect as a result of a cookie being stored on your computer is specific to your computer. We use "session" cookies to collect information about your use of the Site (e.g., whether you are logged in) and to give you a more personalized browsing experience and help you navigate the Site more efficiently from page to page. These cookies are temporary and are deleted when you close your browser. We use "persistent" cookies to gather statistical information about repeat usage from your computer or workstation.<br>
<br>
We collect and use, and may from time to time supply third parties with, this information only as anonymous, collective or aggregated user data for the purposes of usage analysis, quality control and administering and improving the Site.<br>
