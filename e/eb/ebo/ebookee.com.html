<h1>Terms and Privacy</h1>
<br>
<p>Federal law requires that I notify you of my privacy policy. My clients expect their confidential information to be treated with the utmost discretion. I take this responsibility seriously. All information given to me in confidence remains confidential.</p>
<br>
<p>Customer information: The information you provide is needed so that I can make appropriate insurance and other recommendations. Some of this information is known as nonpublic personal information. I have no need to seek or collect nonpublic personal information from third party sources, since my clients provide this information directly. I strive to maintain accurate, up-to-date records in order to serve my clients. Any inaccuracies that are called to my attention are corrected promptly.</p>
<br>
<p>Sharing information: I do not share nonpublic personal information with any outside persons or organizations. However, I cannot rule out the possibility that, at some future date we may need to contract with a third party source of administrative or technical support. In such case, I will require the third party to agree to safeguard such nonpublic information and to use it only for the agreed purpose. I do not sell, rent, or loan my client list to any third party. I do not give prospective clients the names of existing clients unless the client has authorized me to do so.</p>
<br>
<p>Access to and protection of information: Only those governmental agencies with a valid reason for doing so have access to my files containing nonpublic personal information. I maintain security standards to protect nonpublic personal information.</p>
<br>
<p>Disclosure of privacy policy: I provide this privacy notice for informational purposes and I will update it as required by law. If you have any comments, suggestions or questions about my privacy policy, please let me know.</p>
<br>

On a selective basis, we may share your name, address, telephone number and email address with third parties, such as insurance agencies, home warranty companies and tax service providers, record storage companies, moving companies, and other businesses that provide services to home owners, to market financial and non-financial products and services that may interest you. We will only provide this information to companies making these offers available to you under strict confidentiality agreements. For instance, we may share certain information with our strategic business partners with whom we have agreements to help provide customers with Ebookee One Stop Shopping Services, or with other companies which help us to conduct business, such as credit bureaus and businesses which provide account maintenance, analysis and servicing. We may also provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law.
