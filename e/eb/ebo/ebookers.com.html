In response to such request, ebookers&nbsp;and/or its providers will give access to all the information you provide at the time of making your reservation to the applicable government agencies of the countries to or from which you are travelling</p>
<p><strong>6. How we retain and store Personal information</strong></p>

<p>My Account contains your name, email address, password, and departure city from which you usually travel. It may also contain other information so that you do not need to re-enter it each time you Purchase a Product or Service. For example, My Account may contain your billing information unless you tell us not to store it. It may also contain your preferences for seat selection or special meals, details about your participation in loyalty or awards programs and applicable membership numbers, and other travel preferences.</p>
<p>We also keep in My Account all other information that you have elected to provide us, such as gender, favourite activities and lifestyle preferences, and favourite destinations.</p>
<p>My Account also contains a listing of the emails, e-newsletters and other communications we offer to send, and that you have elected to receive or not.</p>
<p>You can access, modify, or delete this Personal Information from time to time as described in paragraph 8 below.</p>

<p><strong>Retention and storage</strong></p>
<p>We will retain your Personal Information in our databases in accordance with our document management, retention and destruction policy and applicable laws. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later. For example, we may need or be required to retain information to allow you to obtain credit for a trip you Purchased but had to cancel. We may also need the retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; to protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or if we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.</p>
