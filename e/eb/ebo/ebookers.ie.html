<p>Our advertising partners, some of which include Trade           Doubler, Affiliate Future, Responsys, Google Ad           Services and Double Click, use cookies and pixel tags in order to identify           from which partner’s Website you came so we can optimize marketing spend. Social           networking web sites, including Facebook, use cookies to allow you to share           content with others. One of our advertising partners, AppNexus,           uses cookies to anonymously identify your browser while you are on another           website so that we can advertise our Website or third parties to you.&nbsp; For example, we may serve an airline’s           advertising to you while you are on another website, on behalf of that           airline.&nbsp;If you wish to opt-out of this kind of advertising, you can           either delete cookies on your browser from adnx.com or you can click on the           following link <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.           By opting out of AppNexus, you may still receive           advertising from ebookers or advertising from third parties that are broadly           targeted (not on the basis of your Session Data).</p>
<p>Some of these third parties may combine anonymous           information obtained in connection with your interaction with our Website           with information obtained from other sources and/or your behaviour on other websites.&nbsp; We do not share your Personal           Information.
