For example, My Account may contain your billing information unless you tell us not to store it. It may also contain your preferences for seat selection or special meals, details about your participation in loyalty or awards programs and applicable membership numbers, and other travel preferences.</p><p>We also keep in My Account all other information that you have elected to provide us, such as gender, favourite activities and lifestyle preferences, and favourite destinations.</p><p>My Account also contains a listing of the emails, e-newsletters and other communications we offer to send, and that you have elected to receive or not.</p><p>You can access, modify, or delete this Personal Information from time to time as described in paragraph 8 below.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Third Parties' Personal Information</strong></h3><p>We will retain in your My Stuff folder the Personal Information of individuals for whom you have made reservations.</p><p>You can access, modify, or delete these third parties' Personal Information at any time, as described in Paragraph 8 below.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Retention and storage</strong></h3><p>We will retain your Personal Information in our databases in accordance with our document management, retention and destruction policy and applicable laws. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later. For example, we may need or be required to retain information to allow you to obtain credit for the trip you Purchased but had to cancel. We may also need the retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; to protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or if we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.</p><p>Your Personal Information will be stored in secured locations, and on servers controlled by ebookers, located either at our offices, or at the offices of our service providers, as described below.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>7. How we protect Personal Information</strong></h3><p> </p><p>ebookers employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access disclosure or modification of Personal Information.

This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted email.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>8. How to access, modify or delete your Personal Information</strong></h2><p> </p><p>We endeavour to ensure that Personal Information is as accurate, complete, and current as necessary for the purposes for which we use that information.
