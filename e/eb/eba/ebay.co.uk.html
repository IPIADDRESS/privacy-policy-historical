This Overall Privacy Statement verifies that eBay Inc. is a member of the TRUSTe 
programme and is in compliance with TRUSTe privacy principles. This statement discloses 
the privacy practises for eBay's entire Web site.
<p>TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit initiative whose mission is to build users' 
  trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the principles of disclosure 
  and informed consent. Because eBay wants to demonstrate its commitment to your 
  privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practises and have our privacy 
  practises reviewed and audited for compliance by TRUSTe.

<p>Your privacy is very important to us. As part of the normal operation of our 
  site we collect and, in some cases, disclose information about you . This Privacy 
  Policy describes the information we collect about you and what may happen to 
  that information. Although this policy may seem long, we have prepared a detailed 
  policy because we believe you should know as much as possible about eBay's practises 
  so that you can make an informed decision. If you have any questions about our 
  Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ebay.com">privacy@ebay.com</a>, 
  or TRUSTe (www.truste.org).
</p><p>As described below, some of your personally identifiable information is disclosed 
  to third parties and used by us and third parties. By accepting the User Agreement, 
  you expressly consent to such use and disclosure of your personally identifiable 
  information.
</p><ol> 
  <p> 
  </p><li><a name="special-note"></a><b>A Special Note About Children.</b>
  <p>
  </p><p>Children are not eligible to use our services and we ask that minors do not submit any personal information to us. If you are a minor, you can 
    use this service only in conjunction with your parents or guardians.
  </p><p> 
  </p></li><li><a name="info-we"></a><b>Information We Collect.</b>
  <p>
  </p><p>In our online registration form, we require you to provide us with your full 
    name, full street address, phone number, email address and a password. You 
    may provide us with a User ID; if you don't, we will use your email address 
    as your User ID. We also request that you provide us with other personal information 
    as detailed in the <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/aw/UK/privacy-appendix-reg.html">Appendix</a>.
  </p><p>If you are registering using an email account at a free email service, we 
    require some additional information, including billing address, credit card 
    number and credit card expiration date. We use this credit card information 
    to verify your name, address, and other information.
  </p><p>In the course of using our site, we automatically track certain information 
    about you. This information includes the URL that you just came from (whether 
    this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL 
    is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. Many 
    sites automatically collect this information.
  </p><p>In addition, we use cookies on certain pages of our site. Among other reasons, 
    cookies allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. 
    Cookies can also help us provide information which is targeted to your interests. 
    (For more information about why we use cookies, <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/aw/UK/cookies-reg.html">click 
    here</a>.) Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. Most cookies 
    are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted 
    at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your 
    browser permits, although in that case you may be required to reenter your 
    password more frequently during a session.
  </p><p>If you choose to bid, buy or sell on our site, we collect information about 
    your bidding, buying and selling behaviour. We also collect other users' comments 
    about you in our feedback area.
  </p><p>If you choose to establish a credit account with us, we collect some additional 
    information, including billing address, credit card number and credit card 
    expiration date and tracking information from cheques or money orders.
  </p><p>If you choose to post messages in our chat rooms or other message areas or 
    leave feedback for other users, we will collect such information about you 
    as you choose to disclose.
  </p><p>If you use a third party service co-branded by eBay, the third party service provider 
    may provide back information about you to eBay.
  </p><p>If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if 
    other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities 
    or postings on the site, we may collect such information into a file specific 
    to you.
  </p><p>For a complete list of information we collect from or about you, please see 
    the <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/aw/UK/privacy-appendix-reg.html">Appendix</a>.
  </p><p> 
  </p></li><li><a name="your-info"></a><b>Our Use of Your Information.</b>
  <p>
  </p><p>We internally use personally identifiable information about you to improve 
    our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyse site usage, 
    to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site's content 
    and layout. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better 
    tailor it to meet our users' needs.
  </p><p>We may also use personally identifiable information about you to deliver 
    information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your interests, such 
    as targeted banners and and promotions. You can receive such information by 
	selecting the appropriate option on the preferences page. You can remove yourself 
	from receiving such information by changing the appropriate option on the 
	preferences page.
  </p><p>We use your email address and, in rare situations your mailing address or 
    phone number, to contact you regarding administrative notices from time to 
    time.
  </p><p>If you choose to conduct an auction on our site or open a credit account, 
    we use your address and billing information to bill you and provide associated 
    support.
  </p><p>We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other information 
    we obtain from your current and past activities on the site, to resolve disputes, 
    troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement. At times, we may look 
    across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular 
    on rare occasions we may evaluate your information to look for users using 
    multiple User IDs or aliases.
  </p><p> 
  </p></li><li><a name="our-disclosure"></a><b>Our Disclosure of Your Information.</b>
  <p>
  </p><p>We do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you 
    to any third party. We do aggregate personally identifiable information and 
    disclose such information in aggregate to advertisers and for other marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, 
    we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to 
    personally identify you. Certain information, such as your password, credit card 
    number, and bank account number, are not disclosed in aggregate at all.
  </p><p>Throughout the site, you are identified by your User ID. Unless you select 
    a unique User ID, our system automatically sets your User ID as your email 
    address. In this situation, where you are identified on the site by your User 
    ID, you disclose your email address to other users and third parties. As a 
    result, other users and third parties might send you unsolicited email and 
    be able to personally identify all of your activities on the site. We describe 
    how to change your User ID below in Section 8.
  </p><p>Even if your User ID is not your email address, your User ID can be used 
    to identify your activities throughout the site. Other people can see your 
    bids, your feedback rating and associated comments, your postings on the site, 
    and so on. Although our pages are coded with robot exclusion headers, others 
    may attempt to automatically collect such publicly-available information from 
    our servers. We also provide others a number of ways to find more out about 
    your site activities, such as our feature that allows users to quickly see 
    all of the auctions you are offering at the time.
  </p><p>eBay cooperates with all law enforcement enquires and with all third parties 
    to enforce their intellectual property or other rights. Therefore, members of 
	the eBay Legal Buddy Programme (which includes local, state and federal law 
	enforcement) can request your UserID, name, street address, city, county, postal code, 
	country, phone number, email and company information. For more information about the 
	Legal Buddy Programme, email <a href="mailto:buddy@ebay.com">buddy@ebay.com</a>.
  </p><p>In addition, other registered users will be given or can access additional 
    personally identifiable information about you. Registered users may request 
    your User ID, email address, phone number, city, state, postal code, country, 
    and company information. Further, we automatically send an email to the winning 
    bidder(s) containing the seller's User ID and email address, and we send an 
    email to the seller containing the winning bidder's User ID and email address. 
    All recipients of such information agree to restrictions on how they use and 
    disclose such information, as described below.
  </p><p>eBay offers features on our site where we will by necessity, need to provide some 
     of Your Information to the third party offering such services. To the extent that 
	 third party requires Your Information to enable you to use their service, we will 
	 notify you of the specific information that will be provided to such third parties. 
	 Before you use the service you should evaluate whether you will accept the terms 
	 and conditions of the third party service, and grant eBay the right to pass Your 
	 Information on to that third party.
  </p><p>Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure 
    that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable 
    information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this 
    Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may 
    be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under 
    certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access 
    transmissions or private communications. Further, we can (and you authorise 
    us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government 
    officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. 
    Therefore, although we use industry standard practises to protect your privacy, 
    we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable 
    information or private communications will remain private.
  </p><p>For a complete list of ways we disclose information about you, please see 
    the <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/aw/UK/privacy-appendix-reg.html">Appendix</a>.
  </p><p> 
  </p></li><li><a name="user-info"></a><b>Your Use of Other Users' Information.</b>
  <p>
  </p><p>In order to facilitate interaction among all eBay community members, our 
    service allows you to access other users' email addresses and phone numbers. 
    Further, as a seller you will be sent via email the User ID and email address 
    of the winning bidder(s), and as a winning bidder you will be send via email 
    the User ID and email address of the seller. By entering into our User Agreement, 
    you agree that, with respect to other user's personally identifiable information 
    that you obtain through the site or through an eBay-related communication 
    or eBay-facilitated transaction, eBay hereby grants to you a licence to use 
    such information only for: (a) eBay-related communications that are not unsolicited 
    commercial messages (which includes Legal Buddy Programme Members requests for user 
	contact information to investigate an intellectual property or other infringement 
	claim), (b) third party services offered through eBay (i.e. escrow, insurance, shipping 
	and fraud complaints) and (c) any other purpose that such user expressly opts 
    into after adequate disclosure of the purpose(s). In the case of (c), you 
    must give users an opportunity to remove themselves from your database and 
    a chance to review what information you have collected about them. In addition, 
    under no circumstances, except as defined in this Section, can you disclose personally 
	identifiable information about another user to any third party without our consent 
	and the consent of such other user after adequate disclosure.
  </p><p>eBay and our users do not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the 
    foregoing, you are not licensed to add an eBay user–even a user who has purchased 
    an auction item from you–to your mail list (email or physical mail) without 
    their express consent after adequate disclosure.
  </p><p> 
  </p></li><li><a name="email-auction"></a><b>Email This Auction to a Friend Service.</b>
  <p>
  </p><p>The terms applicable to the Email This Auction to a Friend service apply 
    to your use of that service. Without limiting the foregoing, you may not use 
    the service to send spam.
  </p><p>We do not use the email addresses you enter for any purpose other than to 
    send your email. We do not rent or sell these email addresses, either. Indeed, 
    we discard the email addresses after they have been used to send your email.
  </p><p> 
  </p></li><li><a name="control-password"></a><b>Control of Your Password.</b>
  <p>
  </p><p>You may not disclose your password to any third parties or share it with 
    any third parties. If, despite the foregoing, you lose control of your password, 
    you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information 
    and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, 
    if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately 
    change your password as detailed in Section 8.
  </p><p> 
  </p></li><li><a name="change-info"></a><b>Reviewing and Changing Your Personally Identifiable 
    Information.</b>
  <p>
  </p><p>Once you register, you will be able to review and change much of your personally 
    identifiable information at eBay, including:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Your User ID and email address. If you change your User ID we keep track 
      of your old User ID(s) and your new User ID..
    </li><li>Your name, company, address, city, county, postal code, country, primary phone 
      number, secondary phone number, fax number or gender.
    </li><li>Your password.
    </li><li>Your credit card number and expiration date, if you supplied one.
  </li></ul>
  <br>
  <p>Once posted, you cannot change or remove any public postings made in our 
     chat rooms or other message areas or the feedback area.
  </p><p>Upon your request, we will remove your credit card number and credit card 
    expiration date from our databases. To make this request, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ebay.com">privacy@ebay.com</a>. 
    However, if you have a free email service account, you may not request to 
    remove your credit card from file unless you wish to terminate your account 
    or place a different credit card on file. Such information will be removed 
    after one billing cycle of your last sale on eBay unless your account is in 
    dispute, in which case your information will be kept on file until the dispute 
    is resolved.
  </p><p>We will retain in our files information you have requested to remove in some 
    circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce 
    our User Agreement. Further, such prior information is never completely removed 
    from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we back 
    up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally 
    identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases in 
    response to your requests.
  </p><p>You must promptly update your information if it changes.
  </p><p> 
  </p></li><li><a name="third-party"></a><b>Third Party Collectors of Information.</b>
  <p>
  </p><p>Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect 
    from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, 
    whether they are bidders, buyers or sellers on our system or other sites throughout 
    the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the 
    personal information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third 
    party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy customs and policies. 
    Since eBay does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are 
    subject to the privacy customs and policies of that third party. We encourage 
    you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
  </p><p> 
  </p></li><li><a name="security"></a><b>Security.</b>
  <p>
  </p><p>eBay uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your 
    personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers. 
    However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
  </p><p> 
  </p></li><li><a name="general"></a><b>General.</b>
  <p>
  </p><p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the 
    eBay User Agreement.
