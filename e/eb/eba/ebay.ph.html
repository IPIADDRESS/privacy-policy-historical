This enables us, in particular, to provide you, with your consent as legally required, with information about products and services, which we believe might interest you, and improve our products, services, content, and advertising by analyzing your use of the services of other eBay Inc. corporate family members, in particular through the matching of certain data (e.g. cookie IDs). Furthermore, this allows us to better prevent, detect, mitigate and investigate fraud, security breaches and other prohibited or unlawful activities, including the assessment of corresponding risks. We will also grant access to personal data about you to other eBay Inc. corporate family members for the aforementioned purposes. To the extent that other eBay Inc. corporate family members have access to your personal data, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this User Privacy Notice.</p>

<h3>5.7 Additional information regarding our payment services for sellers</h3>

<p>With regard to our payment services for sellers in the EU, we additionally point out that eBay S.Ã  r.l. is subject to professional secrecy, which requires special transparency with regard to the processing and, in particular, the transmission of your personal data. We therefore expressly draw your attention to the fact that eBay S.Ã  r.l. may pass on your personal data to trustworthy third parties and business partners where necessary to provide our payment services for sellers, as described above in this Section 5 of the User Privacy Notice. This includes in particular the following third parties and business partners:</p>

<h3>6.1 Data transfers to eBay Inc. corporate family members</h3>

<p>The transmission of personal data between different eBay Inc. corporate family members is based on our worldwide data protection principles, which are binding internal data protection regulations (Binding Corporate Rules, BCRs), or on the basis of other appropriate safeguards (e.g. standard data protection clauses issued or approved by the European Commission (2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)). Through our Binding Corporate Rules, the eBay Inc. corporate family members undertake to protect your personal data and to comply with data protection obligations. Further information on our binding company-wide guidelines and our worldwide data protection principles can be found in the <a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/our-company/privacy-center/" target="_blank">eBay Privacy Center</a>.</p>

<h3>6.2 Other data transfers (from the European Economic Area to third countries)</h3>

<p>We will only transfer your personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to third countries, i.e. countries outside the EEA, on the basis of appropriate safeguards. Third countries providing an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for companies covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland, the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand and Uruguay. Recipients in the USA can be partially certified according to the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome" target="_blank">EU-U.S. Privacy Shield</a>, so that appropriate safeguards for an international data transfer exist. In other cases, eBay provides the necessary safeguards, e.g. through the conclusion of data protection contracts adopted by the European Commission (e.g. standard data protection clauses (2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)) with the recipients, or through other measures provided for by law. A copy of the documentation of the measures taken by us is available <a href="#section3">on request</a>.</p>

<p>Your personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see <a href="#section5">Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients</a> for more information on the processing purposes). Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged to keep your personal data longer (e.g. for tax, accounting or auditing purposes). In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.</p>

<p>The specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines. How long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law. The following factors typically affect the retention period:</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 6px;">
	<li class="unorderedList">
	<div style="padding-left:4px;">
	<p><b class="boldTxt">Necessity for the provision of our Services</b><br>

	</div>
	</li>
	<li class="unorderedList">
	<div style="padding-left:4px;">
	<p><b class="boldTxt">Special categories of personal data</b><br>

	<li class="unorderedList">
	<div style="padding-left:4px;">
	<p><b class="boldTxt">Consent-based processing of personal data</b><br>

	<li class="unorderedList">
	<div style="padding-left:4px;">
	<p><b class="boldTxt">Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations</b><br>

<div class="ex-cnt">
<p><b class="boldTxt">What happens when you share your personal data on our sites or applications?</b><br>
Other users have access to the information you share on eBay or disclose to other users. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile.</p>

<p>When you use our Services, your public user ID may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public user ID and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.</p>

<p>To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, user ID, email address and other contact and shipping information.</p>

<p><b class="boldTxt">Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay</b><br>
When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been cancelled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, email address, contact information, shipping and billing information). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing.</p>

<p>Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.</p>

<p>You may use the personal data that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose constitutes a violation of our <a href="/pages/help/policies/user-agreement.html">User Agreement</a>.</p>

<p><b class="boldTxt">Personal data relating to third parties</b><br>
If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.</p>

<p><b class="boldTxt">Filtering of messages sent via our messaging tools</b><br>
We filter the messages sent via our messaging tools automatically according to certain criteria and check conspicuous messages manually if necessary. The messages are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation, we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.</p>

<p>This is to protect legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing, or other illegal activities) or enforcing our <a href="/pages/help/policies/user-agreement.html">User Agreement</a> and our other <a href="/pages/help/policies/overview.html">rules and policies</a> (e.g. illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the <a href="/pages/help/policies/rfe-spam-non-ebay-sale.html">prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay</a>.</p>

<p><b class="boldTxt">Are you obliged to provide your personal data to us?</b><br>
Some of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g. data by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the User Agreement and the Payments Services Agreement. The provision of any other personal data is voluntary, but may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.</p>

<p><b class="boldTxt">Children's Privacy</b><br>
Our services are not intended for the use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws. According to our User Agreement, children are not permitted to use our Services.</p>

<p><b class="boldTxt">Staying Signed in</b><br>
When you sign in to your account on our Services, we give you the option to stay signed in to your account for certain amount of time. If you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you not to choose to stay signed in. You or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will be able to view and access most parts of your account and take certain specific actions during this signed in period without any further authorization.
