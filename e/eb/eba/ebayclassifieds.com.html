<h3 class="Heading-00203">Overview</h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">Privacy is of great concern to most users of 
the Internet, and is a critical part of an enjoyable and satisfactory 
user experience. We at VeriSign are acutely aware of and sensitive to 
the privacy concerns of our subscribers and other visitors to our Web 
site. Whether you are a customer of our various products and services 
or a visitor to our site, we assure you that we do not collect personal 
information from you unless you provide it to us. If you are enrolling 
for a VeriSign digital certificate ("Digital ID"), you may 
be asked to provide certain personal information. Please note, however, 
that we are asking for this information for the limited purposes of 
creating your Digital ID, providing the services that may be part of 
your Digital ID, and authenticating your identity in order to issue 
you a Digital ID. If you are using Express Checkout by VeriSign (“Express 
Checkout”), you may be asked to provide certain personal information, 
which we will use for the limited purpose of authenticating your identity 
in order to complete your online transaction.&nbsp; If you are enrolling 
in VeriSign’s Digital Brand Management Services, you may be asked to 
provide certain personal information in order for us to create your 
company’s account with us.&nbsp; You should be assured that we do not 
provide or sell personal information about our customers or site visitors 
to vendors that are not involved in the provision of VeriSign's public 
certification and other services.</p>
<p class="Body-0020Text">VeriSign has a service involving authentication 
of individuals in the healthcare sector (the “Healthcare Authentication 
Service”) which allows certain individuals to obtain a Digital ID and 
provide additional personal and professional information in an electronic 
profile (the “Subscriber Profile”) for the purpose of permitting that 
individual to access the Web site or use the services of a third party 
that would be relying on the information in that Digital ID and Subscriber 
Profile (the “Relying Third Party”).&nbsp; In VeriSign’s Healthcare 
Authentication Service, the Digital ID and the ability to create the 
Subscriber Profile are offered by a third party such as the American 
Medical Association (the “Non-VeriSign Digital ID Provider”).&nbsp; 
If you are providing personal information using the Healthcare Authentication 
Service, the information is used by VeriSign to issue you a Digital 
ID, to authenticate you, and also to permit the Relying Third Party 
to access your Subscriber Profile to authenticate you.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This Privacy Statement applies to the verisign.com site. Many of our 
subsidiaries maintain their own privacy policies that may be viewed 
on their Web sites. For our Public Certification Services and for our 
payment services, VeriSign has a "network" of domestic and 
international "Affiliates" that provide certain certification 
and payment services on a worldwide basis. We strive to provide our 
visitors and subscribers with the highest level of privacy possible, 
and therefore require that our Affiliates offer no less protection than 
that offered in this Privacy Statement. In addition, each of our Affiliates 
must meet the data protection requirements of their relevant national 
laws.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span class="Body-0020Text--Char" style=" font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;
">Please note that our site contains links to other sites. VeriSign 
is not responsible for the privacy practices, privacy statements, or 
content regarding these other sites.</span>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<h3 class="Heading-00203">Privacy Policy Enforcement</h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">VeriSign supports TRUSTe's comprehensive assurance 
process. In order to ensure compliance with its Privacy Program, TRUSTe 
monitors our site by conducting initial and periodic reviews and "seeding" 
(tracking unique identifiers in our site's database). TRUSTe also relies 
on online users to report violations of posted privacy statements or 
specific privacy concerns. If a TRUSTe participant is suspected of not 
conforming to the TRUSTe principles, TRUSTe will investigate the issue, 
which could result in penalties, additional audits, or revocation of 
the participant's right to use the TRUSTe trustmark. Extreme violations 
may even be escalated to the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"). 
These enforcement measures are intended to provide some assurances that 
you can rely on our representations in this Privacy Statement. For more 
information on the TRUSTe assurance process, see <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/compliance.php"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">http://www.truste.org/consumers/compliance.php</span></a> &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
If you feel that we are violating this Privacy Statement, please contact 
us at <a href="mailto:practices@verisign.com"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">practices@verisign.com</span></a>. 
Please specify "Privacy Statement" in the subject line of 
your e-mail.&nbsp; You may also call us at 1-650-426-5555.&nbsp; If 
you feel that we do not provide you with an appropriate response, you 
may file a report with TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</span></a></p>
<h3 class="Heading-00203">Information We Gather from You</h3>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Personal Information</h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">We do not collect any personal information 
from a visitor to our site unless that visitor explicitly and intentionally 
provides it. Under no circumstances do we collect any personal data

to provide different personal information. For certain products and 
services, we may require your name, address, telephone number, e-mail 
address, credit card number, bank account information, IP address, and/or 
social security number. Other products and services may require different 
or supplemental information from you in order to apply. For a detailed 
listing of the type of personal information requested for our various 
products, please refer to the enrollment page for the particular product 
or service.</p>
<h3 class="Heading-00203">Statistical Information About Your Visit</h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">When you visit our site, our computers may 
automatically collect statistics about your visit. This information 
does not identify you personally, but rather identifies information 
about a visit to our site. We may monitor statistics such as how many 
people visit our site, the user's IP address, which pages people visit, 
from which domains our visitors come and which browsers people use. 
We use these statistics about your visit for aggregation purposes only. 
These statistics are used to help us improve the performance of our 
Web site.</p>

in this Section. A "cookie" is a piece of information that 
our Web site sends to your browser, which then stores this information 
on your system. If a cookie is used, our Web site will be able to "remember" 
information about you and your preferences either until you exit your 
current browser window (if the cookie is temporary) or until you disable 
or delete the cookie. Many users prefer to use cookies in order to help 
them navigate a Web site as seamlessly as possible. You should be aware 
that cookies contain no more information than you volunteer, and they 
are not able to "invade" your hard drive and return to the 
sender personal or other information from your computer.</p>
<p class="Body-0020Text">Our uses of "cookies" are limited 
to the following specific situations. The first situation is with respect 
to temporary cookies. There are two instances in which we use temporary 
cookies. First, if you are accessing our services through one of our 
online applications (such as through our enterprise Managed PKI service, 
through our Digital Brand Management Services application, or our Express 
Checkout service) our Web server may automatically send your browser 
a temporary cookie, which is used to help your browser navigate our 
site. The only information contained in these temporary cookies is a 
direction value that lets our software determine which page to show 
when you hit the back button in your browser. This bit of information 
is erased when you close your current browser window. If you come to 
our site from one of our business partners, our Web server may also 
send your browser a temporary cookie that reflects an "origination 
code" for that business partner. We use this information for statistical 
and marketing purposes. Second, if you are using VeriSign's Personal 
Trust Agent to log into an access-controlled section of our site or 
to use our Express Checkout service or our Healthcare Authentication 
Service, we set a temporary session cookie to establish that you have 
been authenticated. The information contained in these cookies consists 
of random data that is used by the server to authenticate the browser 
requests to the server for that particular session. It does not include 
any type of personally identifiable information. This bit of information 
is erased when you close your current browser window. If you choose 
not to accept a temporary cookie, you will not be able to navigate in 
these online applications or use the Personal Trust Agent or VeriSign's 
Personal Trust Services.</p>
<p class="Body-0020Text">The second situation in which we may use cookies 
is when you visit our Web site and request documentation or a response 
from us. When you are filling out a form you may be given the option 
of having our Web site deliver a cookie to your local hard drive. If 
you are an Express Checkout customer, you may be given the option of 
having our Web site deliver a cookie to your local hard drive to assist 
you with logging into our site. This type of cookie is not temporary, 
although you can always delete or disable it through your browser preferences. 
If you choose not to accept this type of cookie, you will still be able 
to use our Web site. You might choose to receive this type of cookie 
in order to save time in filling out forms and/or revisiting our Web 
site. We only send this type of cookie to your browser when you have 
clicked on the box labeled "Please remember my profile information" 
when submitting information or communicating with us or, in the case 
of Express Checkout, when you have clicked on the box labeled "Remember 
my e-mail." Even if you choose to receive this type of cookie, 
you can always set your browser to notify you when you receive any cookie, 
giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it in each situation 
in which one is sent. To find more information about cookies, if you 
are using Microsoft Internet Explorer® as your browser, go to the Microsoft

<h3 class="Heading-00203">Bulletin Boards, Chat Rooms and Forums </h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">If you use a&nbsp;forum, bulletin board, chat room 
or other chat tool on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally 
identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or 
used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited 
messages.&nbsp; VeriSign is not responsible for the personally identifiable 
information you choose to submit in these forums.&nbsp; You are also responsible 
for using these forums in a manner consistent with the Rules of Engagement 
or other terms and conditions set forth on the relevant forum site.</p>
<h3 class="Heading-00203">How We Use and With Whom We Share the Personal 
Information We Gather</h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">We assure you that the personal information 
we gather from you is used by us only as explained below.</p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Sending you responses and updates</h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">We generally respond to any e-mail questions, 
requests for product or service information, and other inquiries that 
we receive. We may also retain this correspondence to improve our products, 
services, and Web site, and for other disclosed purposes. Frequently 
we retain contact information so that we can send individuals updates 
or other important information about our services and products. Occasionally 
these updates or other important information may be sent out by third 
parties on our behalf. Please be assured that any third party who contacts 
you in this capacity has executed a confidentiality agreement with us 
that contains a provision ensuring the privacy and security of any transferred 
information and limits the third party's use of the shared information 
to sending updates or providing services on our behalf.  Our subsidiary 
companies may also send you information about their services and products. 
In situations where you have supplied your information in connection 
with a question or request for information about a product or service 
offered by a VeriSign business partner, we may also send the information 
you have supplied to the VeriSign business partners that offer such 
products or services. Please be assured that these VeriSign business 
partners have agreed to ensure the privacy and security of any transferred 
information and may only use the shared information to send you information 
about products or services about which you asked.</p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Facilitating the support, renewal, and purchase 
of our products and services (except if you are using our Healthcare 
Authentication Service)</h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">If you are using VeriSign's Healthcare Authentication 
Service this paragraph does not apply. We may use the information you 
submit to contact you to discuss the support, renewal, and purchase 
of our products and services. We may provide our subsidiary companies 
with your information so that they may send you information about their 
services and products. We may also provide the information you have 
submitted to us to a VeriSign subsidiary, business partner, representative 
or Affiliate (either within or outside the United States) so that the 
subsidiary, business partner, representative or Affiliate can contact 
you and facilitate the support, renewal, and purchase of VeriSign products 
and services. Our Affiliates are either members of the VeriSign Trust 
Network (a certificate-based public key infrastructure that permits 
interoperable and secure electronic commerce and communications) or 
payment services affiliates, and in both cases they help us provide 
our foreign-based (and certain domestic) customers with support, assistance, 
and the provision of products and services in their local markets. You 
may receive a communication directly from one of our subsidiaries, business 
partners, representatives or Affiliates. Please be assured that any 
subsidiary, business partner, representative or Affiliate who contacts 
you for one of these purposes has agreed to use the information we supply 
only in accordance with a confidentiality agreement. To find out the 
names and locations of the subsidiaries, business partners, representatives 
and/or Affiliates to whom we have provided your information, please 
contact us at the address given at the end of this Privacy Statement.</p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Facilitating the support and renewal of our 
products and services (for our Healthcare Authentication Service)</h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">If you are using VeriSign's Healthcare Authentication 
Service where there is a Non-VeriSign Digital ID Provider (such as the 
Physician Authentication Service which is offered by the American Medical 
Association), this paragraph applies to you. We may use the information 
you submit when enrolling for your Digital ID to contact you to discuss 
the support and renewal of our products and services. We may also provide 
the information you have submitted to us to a VeriSign business partner 
so that the business partner can contact you and facilitate the support 
and renewal of VeriSign products and services. You may receive a communication 
directly from one of our business partners. Please be assured that any 
business partner who contacts you for one of these purposes has agreed 
to use the information we supply only in accordance with a confidentiality 
agreement. To find out the names and locations of the business partners 
to whom we have provided your information, please contact us at the 
address given at the end of this Privacy Statement.</p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Facilitating the provision of certain included 
products and services (if you are applying for certain types of Digital 
IDs or certain of our Digital Brand Management Services)</h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">Certain types of Digital IDs come with additional 
third-party services or products that are included with the Digital 
ID. If you purchase one of these Digital IDs, we may forward some or 
all of the information in your application to third party providers 
so that they can provide you with the service or product and follow 
up with you directly regarding their service or product or an upgrade. 
Please be assured that we have agreements with these third-party service 
or product providers that prevent them from disclosing the information 
to other parties.</p>
<p class="Body-0020Text">Likewise, certain of our Digital Brand Management 
Services will involve the disclosure of some or all of your information 
to a registrar or registry of domain names or to a third party service 
provider so that they can provide you with the service you have requested. 
For further explanation about this disclosure or the types of third 
party services available in Digital Brand Management Services, please 
refer to your contract with VeriSign for the purchase of these services.</p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Validating your identity (if you are applying 
for certain types of Digital IDs)</h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">Certain types of Digital IDs require that we 
compare some of the information in your application to information contained 
in a third-party database or with some other third party source. We 
do this in order to authenticate your identity and other attributes, 
and also to prevent identity theft. We have confidentiality agreements 
in place with these third-party databases restricting the disclosure 
of your information. In certain limited situations, we have contracts 
in place permitting the third-party database to disclose the information 
to its subcontractors or affiliates, but only for authenticating your 
identity and only in accordance with confidentiality agreements.</p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204"><a name="01000003"></a>Forming the contents of a Digital 
ID</h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">The exact information that appears in our different 
types of Digital IDs is set forth in the relevant enrollment page and 
this Privacy Statement. Generally this information is limited to e-mail 
address and name, but certain classes of Digital IDs contain additional 
information. For example, SSL Certificates may contain the organization's 
Dun and Bradstreet number. <span class="Body-0020Text--Char" style=" font-weight: bold;
 font-style: italic;">Please note that all information that you provide 
us that forms the content of a Digital ID will be "published." 
Publication of Digital IDs in an accessible location (a repository) 
is an integral part of enabling the widespread use of Digital IDs. Your 
Digital ID will be published in our repository so that a third party 
may access, review, and rely upon your Digital ID. You should have no 
expectation of privacy regarding the content of your Digital ID.</span></p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Permitting a Non-VeriSign Digital ID Provider 
or a Relying Third Party to access the information you provide (if you 
are using the Healthcare Authentication Service)</h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">If you are using the Healthcare Authentication 
Service, we may permit your Non-VeriSign Digital ID Provider to review 
the information you provide. For example, if you are using the Physician 
Authentication Service provided by the American Medical Association, 
we would permit the American Medical Association to review the information 
you provide. The use of your information by such Non-VeriSign Digital 
ID Provider should be governed by your agreement with that Non-VeriSign 
Digital ID Provider.</p>
<p class="Body-0020Text">In all cases where you are using the Healthcare 
Authentication Service, we may permit Relying Third Parties to review 
the information you provide.</p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Processing payments (if you are using our 
payment services)</h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">If you use the VeriSign Payment Services payment 
gateway for online transactions, we may provide your personal information 
to appropriate financial institutions, processors, and third parties 
under contract with VeriSign or our Affiliates for providing a subset 
of the payment services (for example, credit authorization and fraud 
screening). For financial institutions and processors, the use of personally 
identifiable consumer information is governed by federal and state privacy 
laws. For other third parties under contract with VeriSign, the use 
and distribution of your personal information will be used by such entity 
for its internal use related to fulfilling the transaction services 
for VeriSign, will be treated as confidential by this entity, and will 
be transferred between VeriSign and this entity only via encrypted means. 
We may also permit the merchant through which you placed your order 
to review the personal information you provide. The merchant's use of 
your personal information should be governed by your agreement with 
the merchant.</p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Assisting the merchant with your online purchase 
(if you are using Express Checkout)</h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">If you use Express Checkout to purchase a product, 
the merchant from whom you are making the purchase is given a copy of 
the information you have given us. The merchant's use of your personal 
information should be governed by your agreement with the merchant and 
by the merchant's privacy policy (if any).</p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Disclosure by Law and Protection of VeriSign 
and Others</h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">If we are required by law to disclose certain 
information to local, state, federal, national or international government 
or law enforcement authorities, we will do so (for example, we may disclose 
the identity of purchasers of certain software products to the U.S. 
Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration, as required 
under the terms of our export licenses). We will also disclose information 
to third parties as necessary in order to comply with applicable laws 
and regulations. In addition, VeriSign may share information in order 
to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities 
or suspected fraud, or enforce or apply VeriSign's agreements.</p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Surveys</h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">From time-to-time we may request information 
from customers via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely 
voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose 
this information. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring 
or improving the use of and satisfaction with this Web site, and improving 
our customer service and product offerings.</p>
<h3 class="Heading-00203">Your Ability to Opt-Out of Further Notifications</h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">From time-to-time, we notify our subscribers 
of new products, announcements, upgrades and updates. (In the case of 
the VeriSign Healthcare Authentication Service, we will not notify you 
of new products, announcements, upgrades and updates, and therefore, 
you do not need to opt out of receiving these notices.) If you would 
like to opt-out of being notified, please contact us at the address 
given at the end of this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p class="Body-0020Text">If you would like to change your preferences 
online, please visit <a href="http://www.verisign.com/compref/"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">http://www.verisign.com/compref/</span></a> 
Please be aware that you may not opt out of receiving information regarding 
the security, initial use, expiration, product enhancement or migration 
of our Digital IDs or other products or services.</p>
<p class="Body-0020Text">Please note that if you are using Express Checkout, 
the information you provide to us is used only to assist a merchant 
in making your online purchase, facilitating the support of Express 
Checkout or as required by law. We do not use this Express Checkout 
information to send you further notifications or communications other 
than those needed to support the product. Since we do not send you non-essential 
communications using your Express Checkout information, there is no 
need to indicate an opt-out preference. Please note that the merchant 
in Express Checkout may retain your information and you should follow 
that merchant's procedure to opt-out of further notifications.</p>
<h3 class="Heading-00203">Our Security Procedures</h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">We consider the protection of all personal 
information we receive from our Web site visitors and subscribers as 
critical to our corporate mission. Please be assured that we have security 
measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration 
of any personal information we receive from you. As with any transmission 
over the Internet, however, there is always some element of risk involved 
in sending personal information. In order to try to minimize this risk, 
we encrypt all information that you submit in ordering one of our products 
or services using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. Our security 
procedures are also subject to at least an annual SAS-70 Type II audit 
by an internationally-recognized accounting firm.</p>
<h3 class="Heading-00203">How You Can Update or Correct Your Personal 
Information</h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">We cannot update or correct information contained 
in a Digital ID without destroying the integrity of the Digital ID because 
we digitally sign each subscriber's Digital ID as a part of the Digital 
ID issuance process. If we were to subsequently modify or remove any 
information listed in a Digital ID, our digital signature would not 
verify the Digital ID's new content. Furthermore, if a subscriber (sender) 
then digitally signed a message with his or her private key, a third 
party would not be able to properly verify the sender's signature (created 
using the sender's private key) because the sender's Digital ID would 
have been altered after the key pair's creation. For more information 
and tutorials on digital signatures, Digital IDs, keys, and related 
subjects, click here <a href="http://www.verisign.com/repository"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">http://www.verisign.com/repository</span></a></p>
<p class="Body-0020Text">If you would like to update or correct any 
personal information in our records that is not contained in your Digital 
ID, please contact us via e-mail at <a href="mailto:id-support@verisign.com"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">id-support@verisign.com</span></a> 
(for Class 1 and Class 2 Digital IDs) at <a href="mailto:support@verisign.com"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">support@verisign.com</span></a> 
(for Class 3 Digital IDs)), at <a href="mailto:vps-support@verisign.com"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">vps-support@verisign.com</span></a> 
(for payment transaction services), or at the address given at the end 
of this Privacy Statement. You may correct or update any information 
in your Express Checkout profile by accessing your account and making 
these changes. You may correct or update any information in that you 
have supplied in using Digital Brand Management Services by logging 
into the Digital Brand Manager and making the necessary changes to your 
information or, alternatively, contacting our customer service group 
at <a href="mailto:dbms-support@verisign.com"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">dbms-support@verisign.com</span></a> 
to request these changes.</p>
<p class="Body-0020Text">If you are using the VeriSign Healthcare Authentication 
Service and you would like to update or correct any information in your 
Subscriber Profile, you would need to contact the Non-VeriSign Digital 
ID Provider.</p>
<h3 class="Heading-00203">How You Can Revoke (Deactivate) Your Digital 
ID</h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">When a third party wants to rely on a Digital 
ID, it is important for the third party to know its status (for example, 
whether it is valid, suspended (where available) or revoked). The third 
party may do this by accessing our repository and querying for the status 
of the Digital ID. We do not generally delete Digital IDs (and their 
content) from our on-line repository because a third party might not 
then be able to check its status. You may, however, revoke (deactivate) 
your Digital ID. A revoked Digital ID will still appear in our repository 
with an indication that it has been revoked. If you are a Digital ID 
subscriber and would like to have your Digital ID revoked (deactivated) 
from our database, please visit our site at <a href="../products-services/security-services/ssl/revoke.html"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">http://www.verisign.com/products-services/security-services/ssl/revoke.html</span></a> 
and follow the listed instructions or contact us via e-mail at <a href="mailto:id-support@verisign.com"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">id-support@verisign.com</span></a> 
(for Class 1 and Class 2 Digital IDs) or at <a href="mailto:support@verisign.com"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">support@verisign.com</span></a> 
(for Class 3 Digital IDs) or at the address given at the end of this 
Privacy Statement.</p>

<h3 class="Heading-00203">Former Customers of Guardent, Inc.</h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">Guardent, Inc. was acquired by VeriSign on 
February 26, 2004.&nbsp; Guardent adhered to the Safe Harbor Privacy 
Principles with respect to personal data originating in the European
