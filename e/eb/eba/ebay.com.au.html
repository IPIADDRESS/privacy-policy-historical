<h3>5.6 Data Sharing between eBay Inc. Corporate Family Members</h3>

<p>As set out above under "Personal data from other sources", we also receive access to personal data about you from other <a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/our-company/our-businesses/" target="_blank">eBay Inc. corporate family members<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>. This enables us, in particular, to provide you, with your consent as legally required, with information about products and services, which we believe might interest you, and improve our products, services, content, and advertising by analysing your use of the services of other eBay Inc. corporate family members, in particular through the matching of certain data (e.g. cookie IDs). Furthermore, this allows us to better prevent, detect, mitigate and investigate fraud, security breaches and other prohibited or unlawful activities, including the assessment of corresponding risks. We will also grant access to personal data about you to other eBay Inc. corporate family members for the aforementioned purposes. To the extent that other eBay Inc. corporate family members have access to your personal data, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this User Privacy Notice.</p>

<h3>5.7 Additional information regarding our payment services for sellers</h3>

<p>With regard to our payment services for sellers in the EU, we additionally point out that eBay S.Ã  r.l. is subject to professional secrecy, which requires special transparency with regard to the processing and, in particular, the transmission of your personal data. We therefore expressly draw your attention to the fact that eBay S.Ã  r.l. may pass on your personal data to trustworthy third parties and business partners where necessary to provide our payment services for sellers, as described above in this Section 5 of the User Privacy Notice. This includes in particular the following third parties and business partners:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Other payment service providers, including financial institutions</li>
	<li>Companies offering financial products, analyses and scoring (e.g. credit agencies or bureaus)</li>
	<li>Authorities, agencies and other governmental bodies (e.g. to combat fraud)</li>
	<li>Auditors and other professional advisors.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can request a complete list of all third party providers and business partners for our payment services for sellers in the EU by <a href="#section3">contacting us</a>.</p>

<h3>5.8 Automated decision-making</h3>

<p>We use technologies that are considered automated decision making or profiling. We will not make any automated decisions about you that would significantly affect you unless such a decision is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract with you, we have obtained your consent, or we are required by applicable law to use such technology. You will find information on your right to object to this processing of your data below under section <a href="#section8">8. Rights as a data subject</a>.</p>

<h3>5.9 Main consequences if you do not provide your personal data to us</h3>

<p>If you do not provide us with the information we request or if we cannot collect this information from other sources, we may not be able to provide you with our services.</p>

<h2 id="section6" style="display: inline-block;">6. International data transfers</h2>

<p>Some recipients of your personal data are located outside your country or have offices in countries where data protection laws may provide a different level of protection than the laws in your country. When transferring personal data to such recipients, we provide appropriate safeguards.</p>

<div class="hide">
<h3>6.1 Data transfers to eBay Inc. corporate family members</h3>

<p>The transmission of personal data between different eBay Inc. corporate family members is based on our worldwide data protection principles, which are binding internal data protection regulations (Binding Corporate Rules, BCRs), or on the basis of other appropriate safeguards (e.g. standard data protection clauses issued or approved by the European Commission (2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)). Through our Binding Corporate Rules, the eBay Inc. corporate family members undertake to protect your personal data and to comply with data protection obligations. Further information on our binding company-wide guidelines and our worldwide data protection principles can be found in the <a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/our-company/privacy-center/" target="_blank">eBay Privacy Center<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.</p>

<h3>6.2 Other data transfers (from the European Economic Area to third countries)</h3>

<p>We will only transfer your personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to third countries, i.e. countries outside the EEA, on the basis of appropriate safeguards. Third countries providing an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for companies covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland, the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand and Uruguay. Recipients in the USA can be partially certified according to the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome" target="_blank">EU-U.S. Privacy Shield<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>, so that appropriate safeguards for an international data transfer exist. In other cases, eBay provides the necessary safeguards, e.g. through the conclusion of data protection contracts adopted by the European Commission (e.g. standard data protection clauses (2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)) with the recipients, or through other measures provided for by law.

<img alt="Storage duration and erasure" src="https://secureir.ebaystatic.com/pictures/aw/OCS_SelfService/Icon_ebay_UPN_DataRetentionDeletion_FullColor.svg" style="float:left">
<h2 id="section7" style="display: inline-block;">7. Storage duration and erasure</h2>

<p>Your personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see section <a href="#section5">5. Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients</a> for more information on the processing purposes). Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged to keep your personal data longer (e.g. for tax, accounting or auditing purposes). In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defence against legal claims. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.</p>

<div class="expand_collapse_list">
<h3 class="title">Learn more</h3>

<div class="hide">
<p>The specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines. How long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law. The following factors typically affect the retention period:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Necessity for the provision of our Services</strong><br>
	This includes such things as executing the User Agreement with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.</li>
	<li><strong>Special categories of personal data</strong><br>
	If we store special categories of personal data, a shorter retention period is usually appropriate.</li>
	<li><strong>Consent-based processing of personal data</strong><br>
	If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent.</li>
	<li><strong>Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations</strong><br>
	Corresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from laws or official orders. It may also be necessary to store personal data with regard to pending or future legal disputes. Personal data contained in contracts, notifications and business letters may be subject to statutory storage obligations depending on national law.</li>

<div class="hide">
<p>Your rights in detail:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> to the processing of your personal data by us at any time. As a result, we may no longer process your personal data based on this consent in the future. The withdrawal of consent has no effect on the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
	<li>You have the right to obtain <strong>access</strong> to your personal data that is being processed by us. In particular, you may request information on the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, the existence of the right to request rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data or to object to such processing, the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, any available information as to the personal data's source (where they are not collected from you), the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling and, where appropriate, meaningful information on its details. Your right to access may be limited by national law.</li>
	<li>You have the right to obtain from us without undue delay the <strong>rectification</strong> of inaccurate personal data concerning you. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.</li>
	<li>You have the right to obtain from us the <strong>erasure</strong> of personal data concerning you, unless processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. The right to erasure may be limited by national law.</li>
	<li>You have the right to obtain from us <strong>restriction of processing</strong> to the extent that
	<ul>
		<li>the accuracy of the data is disputed by you,</li>
		<li>the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of the personal data,</li>
		<li>we no longer need the data, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or</li>
		<li>you have objected to the processing.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller ("<strong>right to data portability</strong>").</li>
	<li>You have the right to lodge a complaint with a <strong>supervisory authority</strong>. As a rule, you can contact the supervisory authority of your usual place of residence, your place of work or the registered office of the <a href="#section2">controller</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="policy-highlight-warning">If your personal data is processed on the basis of legitimate interests, you have the <strong>right to object</strong> to the processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation. This also applies to profiling. If your personal data is processed by us for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.</p>

<p>The exercise of the above data subjects' rights (e.g. right to access or erasure) is generally free of charge. Where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may charge an appropriate fee (at most our actual costs) in accordance with the applicable statutory regulations or refuse to process the application.</p>

<h3 class="title">Learn more</h3>

<div class="hide">
<h3>What happens when you share your personal data on our sites or applications?</h3>

<p>Other users have access to the information you share on eBay or disclose to other users. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, storefronts, Feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile.</p>

<p>When you use our Services, your public username may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public username and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.</p>

<p>To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, delivery and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, username, email address and other contact and delivery information.</p>

<h3>Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay</h3>

<p>When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been cancelled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, email address, contact information, delivery and billing information). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing.</p>

<p>Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.</p>

<p>You may use the personal data that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as delivery, fraud complaints and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose constitutes a violation of our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a>.</p>

<h3>Personal data relating to third parties</h3>

<p>If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.</p>

<h3>Filtering of messages sent via our messaging tools</h3>

<p>We filter the messages sent via our messaging tools automatically according to certain criteria and check conspicuous messages manually if necessary. The messages are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation, we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.</p>

<p>This is to protect legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing or other illegal activities) or enforcing our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a> and our other <a href="/help/policies/default/ebay-rules-policies?id=4205">rules and policies</a> (e.g. illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the <a href="/help/policies/payment-policies/offers-buy-sell-outside-ebay-policy?id=4272">prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay</a>.</p>

<h3>Are you obliged to provide your personal data to us?</h3>

<p>Some of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g. data by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the User Agreement and the Payments Services Agreement. The provision of any other personal data is voluntary, but may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.</p>

<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

<p>Our services are not intended for the use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws. According to our User Agreement, children are not permitted to use our Services.</p>

<h3>Staying Signed in</h3>

<p>When you sign in to your account on our Services, we give you the option to stay signed in to your account for certain amount of time. If you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you not to choose to stay signed in. You or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will be able to view and access most parts of your account and take certain specific actions during this signed-in period without any further authorisation.

<h2 style="display: inline-block;">Personal information we collect</h2>
&nbsp;

<p><strong>What is personal information?</strong></p>

<p>Personal Information is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>

<p>We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymised or aggregated so that it can no longer be used to identify a specific natural person, whether in combination with other information or otherwise.</p>

<p>We collect personal information from you and other sources when you use our Services.</p>

<p>If you do not provide us with the information we request or if we cannot collect this information from other sources, we may not be able to provide you with our services.</p>

<h2>Other important privacy information</h2>

<p>This section describes some additional privacy information related to your use of our Services that you may find important.</p>

<div class="expand_collapse_list">
<h3 class="title">Learn more: Other important privacy information</h3>

<div class="hide">
<h3>When you share your personal information on our sites or applications â what happens?</h3>

<p>Other users have access to the information you share on eBay. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, your collections, the sellers and collections you follow, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile or your collections.</p>

<p>When you use our Services, your public user ID may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public username and specific items. If you associate your name with your user ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name may then be able to identify your eBay activities.</p>

<p>To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, delivery and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, username, email address and other contact and delivery information.</p>

<h3>Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay</h3>

<p>When you transact with another user, we enable you to obtain or we may provide you with the personal information of the other user (such as their name, account ID, email address, contact details, delivery and billing address) to complete the transaction. Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and we encourage you to inform the other user about your privacy practices and respect their privacy. In all cases, you must comply with the applicable privacy laws, and must give the other user a chance to remove them from your database and them a chance to review what information you have collected about them.</p>

<p>You may use the personal information that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other services offered through eBay (such as escrow, delivery, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates. Using personal information of other users that you have access to for any other purpose constitutes a violation of our <a href="/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a>.</p>

<h3>Unwanted or threatening email</h3>

<p>We do not tolerate abuse of our Services. You do not have permission to add other users to your mailing list (email or postal), call, or send him/her text messages for commercial purposes, even if this user purchased something from you, unless the user has given his/her explicit consent. Sending unwanted or threatening email and text messages is against our <a href="/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a>. To report eBay-related spam or spoof emails please forward the email to <a href="mailto:spam@ebay.com">spam@ebay.com</a> or <a href="mailto:spoof@ebay.com">spoof@ebay.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Communication tools</h3>

<p>We may scan messages automatically and check for spam, viruses, phishing and other malicious activity, illegal or prohibited content or violations of our User Agreement, this privacy notice or our other policies.</p>

<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

<p>Our websites are general audience websites and not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users deemed to be children under their respective national laws.</p>

<h3>Third Party Privacy Practices</h3>

<p>This privacy notice addresses only our use and handling of personal information we collect from you in connection with providing you our Services. If you disclose your information to a third party, or visit a third party website via a link from our Services, their privacy notices and practices will apply to any personal information you provide to them or they collect from you.</p>

<p>We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your personal information once you provide it to a third party and we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your personal information. This is true even where the third parties to whom you disclose personal information are bidders, buyers or sellers on our site.</p>
