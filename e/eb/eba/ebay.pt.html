<p class="Body-0020Text">VeriSign adheres to the EU Safe Harbor Privacy 
Principles with respect to certain personal data that it receives about 
European Union residents in the course of providing certain services.&nbsp; 
Information about VeriSignâs participation in Safe Harbor can be found 
in the section below entitled âSafe Harbor Participationâ.â</p>
<h3 class="Heading-00203">Overview</h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">Privacy is of great concern to most users of 
the Internet, and is a critical part of an enjoyable and satisfactory 
user experience. We at VeriSign are acutely aware of and sensitive to 
the privacy concerns of our subscribers and other visitors to our Web 
site. Whether you are a customer of our various products and services 
or a visitor to our site, we assure you that we do not collect personal 
information from you unless you provide it to us. If you are enrolling 
for a VeriSign digital certificate ("Digital ID"), you may 
be asked to provide certain personal information. Please note, however, 
that we are asking for this information for the limited purposes of 
creating your Digital ID, providing the services that may be part of 
your Digital ID, and authenticating your identity in order to issue 
you a Digital ID.&nbsp; If you are enrolling in VeriSignâs Digital Brand 
Management Services, you may be asked to provide certain personal information 
in order for us to create your companyâs account with us.&nbsp; You 
should be assured that we do not provide or sell personal information 
about our customers or site visitors to vendors that are not involved 
in the provision of VeriSign's public certification and other services.</p>
<p class="Body-0020Text">This Privacy Statement applies to the verisign.com 
site. Many of our subsidiaries maintain their own privacy policies that 
may be viewed on their Web sites. For our Public Certification Services 
and for our payment services, VeriSign has a "network" of 
domestic and international "Affiliates" that provide certain 
certification and payment services on a worldwide basis. We strive to 
provide our visitors and subscribers with the highest level of privacy 
possible, and therefore require that our Affiliates offer no less protection 
than that offered in this Privacy Statement. In addition, each of our 
Affiliates must meet the data protection requirements of their relevant 
national laws.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span class="Body-0020Text--Char" style=" font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;
">Please note that our site contains links to other sites. VeriSign 
is not responsible for the privacy practices, privacy statements, or 
content regarding these other sites.</span>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<h3 class="Heading-00203">Privacy Policy Enforcement</h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">VeriSign supports TRUSTe's comprehensive assurance 
process. In order to ensure compliance with its Privacy Program, TRUSTe 
monitors our site by conducting initial and periodic reviews and "seeding" 
(tracking unique identifiers in our site's database). TRUSTe also relies 
on online users to report violations of posted privacy statements or 
specific privacy concerns. If a TRUSTe participant is suspected of not 
conforming to the TRUSTe principles, TRUSTe will investigate the issue, 
which could result in penalties, additional audits, or revocation of 
the participant's right to use the TRUSTe trustmark. Extreme violations 
may even be escalated to the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"). 
These enforcement measures are intended to provide some assurances that 
you can rely on our representations in this Privacy Statement. For more 
information on the TRUSTe assurance process, see <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/compliance.php"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">http://www.truste.org/consumers/compliance.php</span></a> &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
If you feel that we are violating this Privacy Statement, please contact 
us at <a href="mailto:practices@verisign.com"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">practices@verisign.com</span></a>. 
Please specify "Privacy Statement" in the subject line of 
your e-mail.&nbsp; You may also call us at 1-650-426-5555.&nbsp; If 
you feel that we do not provide you with an appropriate response, you 
may file a report with TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</span></a></p>
<h3 class="Heading-00203">Information We Gather from You</h3>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Personal Information</h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">There are two ways in which you may explicitly 
and intentionally provide us with and consent to our collection of certain 
personal information:</p>
<p class="Body-0020Text" style=" margin-left: 36pt;"><span class="Body-0020Text--Char" style=" font-weight: bold;
">E-mail Request for Information or Registrations for Guides or Seminars</span> 
- We use links throughout our site to provide you with the opportunity 
to contact us via e-mail to ask questions, request information and materials, 
register or sign up for guides or seminars, or provide comments and 
suggestions. You may also be offered the opportunity to have one of 
our representatives contact you personally to provide additional information 
about our products or services. To do so, we may request additional 
personal information from you, such as your name and telephone number, 
to help us satisfy your request.</p>
<p class="Body-0020Text"><span class="Body-0020Text--Char" style=" font-weight: bold;
">Enrollment</span> - If you choose to enroll for one of our products 
or services, we will request certain information from you. Depending 
on the type of product or service that you request, you may be asked 
to provide different personal information. For certain products and 
services, we may require your name, address, telephone number, e-mail 
address, credit card number, bank account information, IP address, and/or 
social security number. Other products and services may require different 
or supplemental information from you in order to apply. For a detailed 
listing of the type of personal information requested for our various 
products, please refer to the enrollment page for the particular product 
or service. </p>
<p class="Body-0020Text">Under no circumstances do we collect any personal 
data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious 
or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, or sex life.</p>
<h3 class="Heading-00203">Statistical Information About Your Visit</h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">When you visit our site, our computers may 
automatically collect statistics about your visit. This information 
does not identify you personally, but rather identifies information 
about a visit to our site. We may monitor statistics such as how many 
people visit our site, the user's IP address, which pages people visit, 
from which domains our visitors come and which browsers people use. 
We use these statistics about your visit for aggregation purposes only. 
These statistics are used to help us improve the performance of our 
Web site.</p>
<h3 class="Heading-00203">Use of Cookies</h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">We only use "cookies" as described 
in this Section. A "cookie" is a piece of information that 
our Web site sends to your browser, which then stores this information 
on your system. If a cookie is used, our Web site will be able to "remember" 
information about you and your preferences either until you exit your 
current browser window (if the cookie is temporary) or until you disable 
or delete the cookie. Many users prefer to use cookies in order to help 
them navigate a Web site as seamlessly as possible. You should be aware 
that cookies contain no more information than you volunteer, and they 
are not able to "invade" your hard drive and return to the 
sender personal or other information from your computer.</p>
<p class="Body-0020Text">Our uses of "cookies" are limited 
to the following specific situations. The first situation is with respect 
to temporary cookies. There are two instances in which we use temporary 
cookies. First, if you are accessing our services through one of our 
online applications our Web server may automatically send your browser 
a temporary cookie, which is used to help your browser navigate our 
site. The only information contained in these temporary cookies is a 
direction value that lets our software determine which page to show 
when you hit the back button in your browser. This bit of information

<h3 class="Heading-00203">Bulletin Boards, Chat Rooms and Forums </h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">If you use a&nbsp;forum, bulletin board, chat room 
or other chat tool on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally 
identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or 
used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited

<p class="Body-0020Text">We assure you that the personal information 
we gather from you is used by us only as explained below.</p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Sending you responses and updates</h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">We generally respond to any e-mail questions, 
requests for product or service information, and other inquiries that 
we receive. We may also retain this correspondence to improve our products, 
services, and Web site, and for other disclosed purposes. Frequently 
we retain contact information so that we can send individuals updates 
or other important information about our services and products. Occasionally 
these updates or other important information may be sent out by third 
parties on our behalf. Please be assured that any third party who contacts 
you in this capacity has executed a confidentiality agreement with us 
that contains a provision ensuring the privacy and security of any transferred 
information and limits the third party's use of the shared information 
to sending updates or providing services on our behalf.  Our subsidiary 
companies may also send you information about their services and products. 
In situations where you have supplied your information in connection 
with a question or request for information about a product or service 
offered by a VeriSign business partner, we may also send the information 
you have supplied to the VeriSign business partners that offer such 
products or services. Please be assured that these VeriSign business 
partners have agreed to ensure the privacy and security of any transferred 
information and may only use the shared information to send you information 
about products or services about which you asked.</p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Facilitating the support, renewal, and purchase 
of our products and services </h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">We may use the information you submit to contact 
you to discuss the support, renewal, and purchase of our products and 
services. We may provide our subsidiary companies with your information 
so that they may send you information about their services and products. 
We may also provide the information you have submitted to us to a VeriSign 
subsidiary, business partner, or independent reseller (either within 
or outside the United States) so that the subsidiary, business partner, 
or independent reseller can contact you and facilitate the support, 
renewal, and purchase of VeriSign products and services.&nbsp; You may 
receive a communication directly from one of our subsidiaries, business 
partners, or independent resellers. Please be assured that any subsidiary, 
business partner, or independent reseller who contacts you for one of 
these purposes has agreed to use the information we supply only in accordance 
with a confidentiality agreement. To find out the names and locations 
of the subsidiaries, business partners, and/or independent resellers 
to whom we have provided your information, please contact us at the 
address given at the end of this Privacy Statement.</p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Facilitating the provision of certain included 
products and services (<span class="Heading-00204--Char" style=" font-style: italic;
">if you are applying for certain types of Digital IDs or certain of 
our Digital Brand Management Services)</span></h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">Certain types of Digital IDs come with additional 
third-party services or products that are included with the Digital 
ID. If you purchase one of these Digital IDs, we may forward some or 
all of the information in your application to third party providers 
so that they can provide you with the service or product and follow 
up with you directly regarding their service or product or an upgrade. 
Please be assured that we have agreements with these third-party service 
or product providers that prevent them from disclosing the information 
to other parties.</p>
<p class="Body-0020Text">Likewise, certain of our Digital Brand Management 
Services will involve the disclosure of some or all of your information 
to a registrar or registry of domain names or to a third party service 
provider so that they can provide you with the service you have requested. 
For further explanation about this disclosure or the types of third 
party services available in Digital Brand Management Services, please 
refer to your contract with VeriSign for the purchase of these services.</p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Validating your identity (<span class="Heading-00204--Char" style=" font-style: italic;
">if you are applying for certain types of Digital IDs)</span></h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">Certain types of Digital IDs require that we 
compare some of the information in your application to information contained 
in a third-party database or with some other third party source. We 
do this in order to authenticate your identity and other attributes, 
and also to prevent identity theft. We have confidentiality agreements 
in place with these third-party databases restricting the disclosure 
of your information. In certain limited situations, we have contracts 
in place permitting the third-party database to disclose the information 
to its subcontractors or affiliates, but only for authenticating your 
identity and only in accordance with confidentiality agreements.</p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204"><a name="01000001"></a>Forming the contents of a Digital 
ID</h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">The exact information that appears in our different 
types of Digital IDs is set forth in the relevant enrollment page and 
this Privacy Statement. Generally this information is limited to e-mail 
address and name, but certain classes of Digital IDs contain additional 
information. For example, SSL Certificates may contain the organization's 
Dun and Bradstreet number. <span class="Body-0020Text--Char" style=" font-weight: bold;
 font-style: italic;">Please note that all information that you provide 
us that forms the content of a Digital ID will be "published." 
Publication of Digital IDs in an accessible location (a repository) 
is an integral part of enabling the widespread use of Digital IDs. Your 
Digital ID will be published in our repository so that a third party 
may access, review, and rely upon your Digital ID. You should have no 
expectation of privacy regarding the content of your Digital ID.</span></p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Processing payments (<span class="Heading-00204--Char" style=" font-style: italic;
">if you are using our payment service)</span></h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">If you use the VeriSign Payment Services payment 
gateway for online transactions, we may provide your personal information 
to appropriate financial institutions, processors, and third parties 
under contract with VeriSign or our independent resellers for providing 
a subset of the payment services (for example, credit authorization 
and fraud screening). For financial institutions and processors, the 
use of personally identifiable consumer information is governed by federal 
and state privacy laws. For other third parties under contract with 
VeriSign, the use and distribution of your personal information will 
be used by such entity for its internal use related to fulfilling the 
transaction services for VeriSign, will be treated as confidential by 
this entity, and will be transferred between VeriSign and this entity 
only via encrypted means. We may also permit the merchant through which 
you placed your order to review the personal information you provide. 
The merchant's use of your personal information should be governed by 
your agreement with the merchant.</p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Disclosure by Law and Protection of VeriSign 
and Others</h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">If we are required by law to disclose certain 
information to local, state, federal, national or international government 
or law enforcement authorities, we will do so (for example, we may disclose 
the identity of purchasers of certain software products to the U.S. 
Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration, as required 
under the terms of our export licenses). We will also disclose information 
to third parties as necessary in order to comply with applicable laws 
and regulations. In addition, VeriSign may share information in order 
to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities 
or suspected fraud, or enforce or apply VeriSign's agreements.</p>
<h4 class="Heading-00204">Surveys</h4>
<p class="Body-0020Text">From time-to-time we may request information 
from customers via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely 
voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose 
this information. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring 
or improving the use of and satisfaction with this Web site, and improving 
our customer service and product offerings.</p>
<h3 class="Heading-00203">Your Ability to Opt-Out of Further Notifications</h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">From time-to-time, we notify our subscribers 
of new products, announcements, upgrades and updates. If you would like 
to opt-out of being notified, please contact us at the address given 
at the end of this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p class="Body-0020Text">If you would like to change your preferences 
online, please visit <a href="http://www.verisign.com/compref/"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">http://www.verisign.com/compref/</span></a>.  
If you receive a marketing communication from our subsidiaries, business 
partners or independent resellers, you should opt-out with that entity 
directly.&nbsp; Please be aware that you may not opt out of receiving 
information regarding the security, initial use, expiration, product 
enhancement or migration of our Digital IDs or other products or services.</p>
<h3 class="Heading-00203">Our Security Procedures</h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">We consider the protection of all personal 
information we receive from our Web site visitors and subscribers as 
critical to our corporate mission. Please be assured that we have security 
measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration 
of any personal information we receive from you. As with any transmission 
over the Internet, however, there is always some element of risk involved 
in sending personal information. In order to try to minimize this risk, 
we encrypt all information that you submit in ordering one of our products 
or services using the <a href="../ssl/ssl-information-center/how-ssl-security-works/index.html"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">Secure 
Sockets Layer</span></a> (SSL) protocol. Our security procedures are 
also subject to at least an annual SAS-70 Type II audit by an internationally-recognized 
accounting firm.</p>
<h3 class="Heading-00203">How You Can Update or Correct Your Personal 
Information</h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">If you need to update or correct information 
contained in a Digital ID you will need to revoke your Digital ID and 
obtain a new one because we digitally sign each subscriber's Digital 
ID as a part of the Digital ID issuance process. If we were to subsequently 
modify or remove any information listed in a Digital ID, our digital 
signature would not verify the Digital ID's new content. Furthermore, 
if a subscriber (sender) then digitally signed a message with his or 
her private key, a third party would not be able to properly verify 
the sender's signature (created using the sender's private key) because 
the sender's Digital ID would have been altered after the key pair's 
creation. For more information and tutorials on digital signatures, 
Digital IDs, keys, and related subjects, click here <a href="http://www.verisign.com/repository"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">http://www.verisign.com/repository</span></a></p>
<p class="Body-0020Text">If you would like to update or correct any 
personal information in our records that is not contained in your Digital 
ID, please contact us via e-mail at <a href="mailto:id-support@verisign.com"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">id-support@verisign.com</span></a> 
(for Class 1 and Class 2 Digital IDs) at <a href="mailto:support@verisign.com"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">support@verisign.com</span></a> 
(for Class 3 Digital IDs)), at <a href="mailto:vps-support@verisign.com"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">vps-support@verisign.com</span></a> 
(for payment transaction services), or at the address given at the end 
of this Privacy Statement. You may correct or update any information 
that you have supplied in using Digital Brand Management Services by 
logging into the Digital Brand Manager and making the necessary changes 
to your information or, alternatively, contacting our customer service 
group at <a href="mailto:dbms-support@verisign.com"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">dbms-support@verisign.com</span></a> 
to request these changes.</p>
<h3 class="Heading-00203">How You Can Revoke (Deactivate) Your Digital 
ID</h3>
<p class="Body-0020Text">When a third party wants to rely on a Digital 
ID, it is important for the third party to know its status (for example, 
whether it is valid, suspended (where available) or revoked). The third 
party may do this by accessing our repository and querying for the status 
of the Digital ID. We do not generally delete Digital IDs (and their 
content) from our on-line repository because a third party might not 
then be able to check its status. You may, however, revoke (deactivate) 
your Digital ID. A revoked Digital ID will still appear in our repository 
with an indication that it has been revoked. If you are a Digital ID 
subscriber and would like to have your Digital ID revoked (deactivated) 
from our database, please visit our site at <a href="../ssl/revoke.html"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">http://www.verisign.com/ssl/revoke.html</span></a> 
and follow the listed instructions or contact us via e-mail at <a href="mailto:id-support@verisign.com"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">id-support@verisign.com</span></a> 
(for Class 1 and Class 2 Digital IDs) or at <a href="mailto:support@verisign.com"><span class="Hyperlink--Char">support@verisign.com</span></a>

  Data to communicate regarding VeriSign products or services, and disclose 
  such data to subsidiaries, business partners and independent resellers 
  of VeriSign services for the same purposes.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="Body-0020Text">With respect to any sharing of EU Personal

  Individuals may contact VeriSign as indicated below in order to review 
  their EU Personal Data.&nbsp; However, customer contacts may first wish
