<ol><li>Subject to other provisions in this Agreement you will be compensated for each Qualifying Transaction in accordance with the applicable Program Details.

Compensation will be calculated based on EPN’s tracking data at the end of each month, which is definitive and shall control in the event of any tracking dispute.</li>
<li>If an end user has clicked on multiple Links from different Affiliates prior to a Qualifying Transaction (resulting in multiple cookies placed on the end user’s computer), EPN shall only compensate the Affiliate whose Link was the last clicked by the end user so long as the applicable Advertiser did not conduct any promotional activities (a) subsequent to such click and prior to the Qualifying Transaction and (b) that would have placed a cookie overwriting the cookie from the last Affiliate’s Link.</li>
<li>EPN has the right to change any existing Program Details with respect to Qualifying Transactions and compensation in its sole discretion with three (3) days’ notice to you.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Payments.</strong>
<ol><li><strong>Timing.</strong> Subject to Section II.B (Accurate Information), each month, EPN will issue to you any positive balance in your account for transactions reported for the previous month, so long as your account balance exceeds the required minimum account balance of 10 USD, 10 CAD, 10 EUR or 10 GBP, as applicable. The number or amount of transactions, credits for payments and debits for chargebacks as calculated by EPN shall be final and binding on you.</li>
<li><strong>Form of Payment.</strong> The currency of your account is determined by your country of residence. You can collect payments (a) with a verified PayPal account or (b) by direct deposit if available for your country of residence. The conversion rate will be determined in accordance with EPN’s operating standards using the rates prevailing on the date the Qualifying Transaction is completed.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Taxes.</strong> You are responsible for any taxes that may be due in connection with your participation in the Network or otherwise on the services provided by you. EPN does not pay additional compensation to you for taxes. If the withholding of any tax is required in respect of any payment to you, EPN will (1) withhold the applicable amount from such payment and (2) pay such amount to the relevant authorities in accordance with any Applicable Law in the relevant jurisdiction(s). Upon request from you, EPN will provide a copy of the tax receipt documenting payment of the tax to the relevant authorities. You agree to complete and provide to us or to the applicable taxing authority at least 10 days prior to the payment due date, such forms, certifications or other documents as may be reasonably requested by EPN, to reduce or exempt withholding taxes with respect to payments made to you when and where required by Applicable Law. If it is later determined that EPN should have withheld and/or paid additional tax but did not withhold or pay such tax, then you shall pay the applicable tax and hold EPN harmless from any penalties or interest thereon.</li>
<li><strong><a id="5-4" name="5-4">Non-Payment, Withholding, Reversal and Chargebacks</a></strong>
<ol><li>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, EPN shall have no duty to pay you for Qualifying Transactions during any current or previous month when you were in breach of this Agreement or an agreement covering your participation in eBay’s Buy API Program (if applicable), or if EPN, in its sole discretion, has reason to believe that you or your Agent(s) have breached this Agreement or have engaged in potentially fraudulent activities.</li>
<li>EPN may debit your account in an amount equal to a payment previously made to you or a compensation that has been credited to your account, but has not been paid yet, if EPN determines in its sole discretion that there has been (a) duplicate entry or other clear error; (b) non-bona fide transactions or other fraudulent activity; (c) a breach of, or other failure to complete or reversal of the Qualifying Transaction; or (d) failure to comply with any terms of this Agreement. EPN may apply a chargeback to your account at any time, including previous payment cycles.</li>
<li>EPN will make all commercially reasonable efforts to pay any positive balance that is due to you. In certain circumstances, based on EPN’s records, it may not be possible for EPN to pay you because for a period of 24 months or more: (a) your account has been inactive, meaning that you have not logged into your account or you have not accepted funds, payments or other amounts that EPN has attempted to pay or deliver to you; (b) EPN has been unable to reach you, or has not received adequate payment instructions from you, after contacting you at the email address shown in EPN’s records; or (c) you have not generated the minimum amount of commissions to qualify for payment. In these circumstances, EPN may, without further notice to you, turn the unpaid or undelivered amounts over to the applicable regulatory authorities in accordance with Applicable Law.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Tracking and True-Up Payments
<ol><li>Although EPN strives to track all Qualifying Transactions accurately, there may be instances where EPN fails to track all Qualifying Transactions. </li>
<li>In cases where EPN discovers that EPN has failed to capture all Qualifying Transactions, EPN shall strive to determine the discrepancies between intended and actual Qualifying Transactions and conduct true-up payments.  If EPN deems appropriate, EPN may design a methodology for calculating true-up payments in EPN’s sole discretion. </li>

                    the browser’s start page would constitute a bundling

                response to a user’s deliberate and voluntary click (or, for a

                and Content or when Participating Sites and Content is open on
                a user’s computer or mobile device. Your Software Application
                is prohibited if in EPN’s sole discretion it is likely to
                confuse the end user or trick the end user into thinking the
                Software Application is part of the Participating Sites and
                Content. Regardless, if your Software Application presents an
                ad for Advertiser when the end user is already on Participating
                Sites and Content, the Software Application must not send the
                end user to Participating Sites and Content via a Tracking Code
                on user’s computer or mobile device and you shall not earn
                compensation for any transaction resulting from such activity.

                <strong>Advance Review and Approval by EPN.</strong>
                Before distributing any Software Application or participating
                in any Program, you must provide EPN with a complete statement
                of the characteristics of your Software Application. Before EPN
                provides its approval, you must integrate your Software
                Application with EPN so EPN may evaluate the integration and
                its effect on Advertisers’ brand and Advertisers’ customer
                experience. EPN will withhold all compensation for traffic
                directed through Software Applications not approved by EPN. If
                a new version of your Software Application makes material
                changes to your participation in the Network, you must provide
                EPN with a complete statement of such changes for written
                approval. For purposes of this Section, “material changes”
                include any change to the methods of installation of your
                Software Application, the partners who distribute your Software
                Application, or the circumstances in which your Software

            <strong>Cookie Stuffing. </strong>
            You may not stuff cookies or other tracking tags on an end user’s

            that are only viewing your website, Promotional Content or

        <li>
            <strong>Non-Bona Fide Qualifying Transactions. </strong>
            You may not cause Qualifying Transactions to be made in bad faith,
            including but not limited to using invisible methods to generate
            impressions, clicks or transactions that are not initiated by the
            affirmative and genuine action of an end user, or using any cookie,
            device, program, robot, iframe or hidden frame, pop-up window or
            any other operation or process that interferes with EPN’s ability
            to properly identify and track transactions. Any method that
            artificially generates clicks, impressions, or activity is
            prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, clicks or
            impressions generated when you or your Agents click on your own
            Promotional Content containing Tracking Code, automated clicking
            tools or traffic sources, robots, or other deceptive software. To
            be considered valid, clicks and conversions must result from
            genuine user interest. EPN will use its sole discretion to
            determine instances of invalid click activity, which may come in
            different forms and may include activity not due to any deliberate
            action on your part. EPN is not obliged to disclose details about
            the functioning of EPN’s fraud detection systems. Because EPN needs
            to protect its proprietary detection system, EPN may be unable to
            provide you with all information about your account activity,
            including any web pages, end users, or third-party services that

You represent and warrant that you will maintain privacy policies sufficient to protect the Personal Data and compliant with the Applicable Law. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">14.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration:underline">Liability and Indemnification</span>: You shall be liable for any of your acts and/or omissions relating to the obligations in this DPRA that result in a Security Breach of eBay’s Personal Data.

<p><strong>Payment Structure for Qualifying Transactions: </strong>A Qualifying Transaction occurs when (1) an end user makes a purchase on a participating Affiliate website within 24 hours after clicking your Promotional Content for a “Buy It Now” item, (2) an end user places a bid on an auction within 24 hours after clicking your Promotional Content and wins such auction within 10 days for an “Auction” item, or (3) an end user makes a purchase through eBay’s API on a digital property that is owned and operated by you and that complies with all other terms and conditions of your agreement for participation in eBay’s Buy API Program. For any Qualifying Transactions, you receive a percentage of the revenue eBay Inc. earns from that purchase, based on the category-level commission rates shown below. Note that there are certain items and categories for which eBay Inc. earns low or no revenue; in such cases, you will therefore earn low or no revenue share. These items and categories may include, but are not limited to gift cards, items sold by charities, and special promotional deals.  You will only be paid once for each Qualifying Transaction; no duplicate payments will be made under eBay’s Buy API Program.</p>
