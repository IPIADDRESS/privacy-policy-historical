<p>With respect to personal data received<strong> </strong>or<strong> </strong>transferred  pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Radial is subject to the regulatory  enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. &nbsp;In certain  situations, Radial may be required to disclose personal data in response to  lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or  law enforcement requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Categories of  Individual Data Subjects</strong><br>
In general, Radial may obtain EU Personal Data in the United  States about several different types of individuals, including consumers, Clients  (defined below), suppliers and other business partners. Radial's practices with  respect to each of these types of individual data subjects are described below.</p>
<p>Consumers<br>
  Radial provides a wide variety of services and solutions to  its business clients (each, a "Client") that facilitate services for  their customers ("Consumers"). In these cases, personal data collected  from Consumers is owned by the applicable Client, and Radial processes this  data on the Client's behalf. There may be limited instances in which Radial  owns and processes personal data collected from Consumers on its own behalf,  rather than on behalf of a Client. In all instances, Radial will obtain access  to EU Personal Data about Consumers in the course of operating websites,  processing payments, fulfilling orders, implementing marketing campaigns and  providing customer care and other related services. Such data may include,  name, billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number,  credit card or other payment information, and other information, depending on  the particular Client, website or other application at issue. In all instances,  Radial will not share, sell, rent, or trade with third parties for promotional  purposes any personal data processed by Radial, unless Radial is directed to do  so by a Client who owns such personal data.</p>
<p>Clients, Suppliers and Other Business Partners<br>
  Radial may obtain various types of EU Personal Data about  employees and agents of its Clients, suppliers and other business partners.  Such data may include contact information (e.g. names, addresses, telephone and  fax numbers, and email addresses); user IDs and passwords; information  collected through Internet-based and ecommerce activities; and other  transaction-related data.<br>
  Radial may use these types of EU Personal Data for business  purposes, including to establish and maintain Client, supplier and other business  relationships; to deliver or provide products or services; to provide access to  Internet-based applications; to perform accounting functions; and to conduct  other activities as necessary or appropriate in connection with the  establishment, servicing and development of the business relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Why We Collect  Information</strong><br>
  We (including all members of our corporate family) may  collect and use the information collected at our Sites for any internal purpose,  and we may provide that information to our business partners and vendors to be  used by them in connection with such purposes. For example, we may use this  data to monitor our Sites and to collect aggregate data for marketing purposes  and for other future uses, or to determine the most appropriate information to  send to those who request it.</p>
<p>You may choose voluntarily to give us personally  identifiable information, such as your name, address, phone number, email  address, or other information about yourself.&nbsp;  In addition, we may collect non-personal information automatically as  you navigate our sites. This information may include (but may not be limited  to): location data, IP address, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP),  referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our sites (e.g., HTML pages, graphics,  etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, device data such as  mobile identifiers, carrier network information, the mobile website or mobile  app used, and cookie or pixel tag data.</p>
<p>Certain forms on our sites may also request contact and  profile information, such as user name, email address, website, phone number,  or company information. Completion of these forms is entirely voluntary but may  be required in order to request certain services from Radial. Resume submissions  on our Sites are used to screen candidates and contact them for interviews.</p>
<p>Radial may also use our sites to periodically survey our clients  for purposes of improving the quality of our service and customer satisfaction.  Client participation is completely voluntary, and any information we collect  from you as part of our surveys will be treated with the same respect as any  other information gathered in accordance with this Notice.</p>
<p><strong>How We Collect It</strong><br>
  Our Sites use web beacons and other technologies to collect information  when you access our websites, and we may store that information in “cookies”.</p>
<p>We only obtain personally identifying information if it is  supplied voluntarily. If you have chosen to receive marketing messages from us  about our products and services, we may use information from our log files,  cookies, or web beacons to help us make those communications more useful or  interesting to you. We may periodically track the open-rates and click behavior  of our emails and other messages and advertisements to help us identify which  portions of our advertisements are most popular and effective with our  customers.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Cookies  and Other Technologies</strong><br>
  When you access our sites, we and our affiliates, business  partners and vendors may place small data files on your computer or other  device. We use these data files, commonly known as “Cookies” to help us  identify you as a site visitor or Client, customize our content and enhance  your site experience. These third parties may also use a technology called “Tags”  or “Web Beacons”. Similar in function to Cookies, Web Beacons allow us to  understand the movements of visitors to our Sites. The tracking technologies on  our Sites do not collect personal information. We use this information to  analyze trends, to administer our Sites, to track users' movements around the  Sites, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a  whole.&nbsp; Radial does not provide personal  information through the use of web beacons and cookies to these parties.</p>
<p>You should note that although most browsers are initially  set up to accept cookies, you may be able to change your browser settings to  cause your browser to refuse first party or third party cookies or to indicate  when a third party cookie is being sent. However, disabling or limiting cookies  may cause certain features of this site to not function properly. Check your  browser’s “Help” files or other similar resources to learn more about handling  cookies on your browser.</p>
<p><strong>Data Supplementation</strong><br>
  We may receive information about you from other sources,  including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have  purchased data, and combine this data with information we already have about  you. &nbsp;This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new  customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you.  Examples of the types of personal information that may be obtained from public  sources or purchased from third parties and combined with information we  already have about you may include address information about you from third  party sources, such as the U.S. Postal Service, to verify your address. This  information is used for payment processing, fraud prevention and fulfillment  services. </p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track</strong><br>
  California law requires us to state how we respond to Do Not  Track (DNT) signals. Because there is currently no industry or legal standard  for recognizing or honoring DNT, we do not currently respond to DNT signals. We  await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine  when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take. </p>
