<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">1. Introduction</a></h2>
<p> eBike Insurance are committed to both respecting your privacy and providing a secure website so your personal information is protected. <br>
  You can be assured any information you provide to us will be used strictly in accordance with the terms laid out in this statement. 
  eBike Insurance is a trading name of Southern Rock Insurance Company Limited. </p>
<a class="terms" href="#top">back to top</a><br>
<h2><a name="collecting" id="collecting">2. Collecting Information</a></h2>
<p> We will only look to request necessary information from you and will only use and disclose this information in the course
  of arranging and administering your insurance, and to inform you of other services which we feel maybe appropriate to you.<br>
  The type of information we will collect will include, for example, your name and postal address, date of birth, telephone number,
  email address, credit/debit card details and bank account details.<br>
  The information we hold will be, to the best of our knowledge, accurate and up to date. Under the Data Protection Act you have
  the right to see the personal information that we hold about
  you in our records. <br>
  All personal information is treated confidentially and is safely stored on our computer, with security systems preventing unauthorised access. </p>
<a class="terms" href="#top">back to top</a>
<h2><a name="con" id="con">3. Confidentiality</a></h2>
<p> We will endeavour to treat all your personal information as private and confidential. 
  Other than under the terms of this privacy statement we will not disclose any of your information to anyone.<br>
  We would like to bring your attention to our obligations to disclose information in the following exceptional cases permitted by law.<br>
  These are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Where we are legally forced to</li>
  <li>Where there is a duty to the public to disclose information</li>
  <li>Where you have given permission to disclose information</li>
  <li>Where we have to protect our interest</li>
</ul>
<p> In the event that you have to make a claim then we will need to disclose information with any other parties involved in that particular claim. 
  For example these parties may include the third party involved with the claim, the third party's insurer or the third party's solicitor.<br>
  As highlighted in our Terms Of Business, your policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID). 
  The MID is run by the Motor Insurers Information Centre (MIIC). 
  MID data may be used by the DVLA and DVLNI for the purpose of Electronic Vehicle Licensing and by the Police for the purposes of establishing
  whether a driver's use of the vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor insurance policy and/or for preventing and detecting crime. 
  If you are involved in an accident, the MID may be used by Insurers, MIIC and the Motor Insurer's Bureau to identify relevant policy information. 
  People pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident may also obtain relevant information held on the MID. 
  For more information visit www.miic.org.uk </p>
<p> eBike Insurance will also pass information to the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register which is run by Insurance Database
  Services Limited (IDS Ltd), and the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud
  and Theft register, run by the Association of British Insurers
  (ABI). The aim is to help us to check information provided and
  also prevent fraudulent claims. When dealing with your request
  for insurance these registers maybe searched. When you inform
  us of an incident, we will pass this information relating to
  it to the registers. </p>
<a class="terms" href="#top">back to top</a>
<h2><a name="info" id="info">4. Information Security</a></h2>
<p> How we protect your personal information from misuse and abuse
  is of great importance to us. We are constantly reviewing and
  enhancing our technical and physical security procedures to
  protect your personal data from unauthorised access. </p>
<p> You will only be able to access your policy by inputting your
  unique policy number and your email address. The eBike Insurance
  site also uses secure socket layer (SSL) 128-bit encryption
  technology to encrypt sensitive information such as your financial
  information. </p>
<p> When you request a quote from us, we will process the data on
  a secure server. </p>

  administering your policy, claims handling and responding to complaints or policy enquiries.<br>

  to you.<br>
  We will also contact you to remind you your insurance is due for renewal. </p>
