					<p>eBike Insurance are committed to both respecting your privacy
						and providing a secure website so your personal information
						is protected.<br>
						You can be assured any information you provide to us will be
						used strictly in accordance with the terms laid out in this
						statement.<br>

					<br><a class="terms" href="#top">back to top</a><br>
					<p><strong><a name="collecting" id="collecting"></a><br>
						2. Collecting Information</strong></p>
					<p>We will only look to request necessary information from you
						and will only use and disclose this information in the course
						of arranging and administering your insurance, and to inform
						you of other services which we feel maybe appropriate to you.<br>
						The type of information we will collect will include, for example,
						your name and postal address, date of birth, telephone number,
						email address, credit/debit card details and bank account details.<br>
						The information we hold will be, to the best of our knowledge,
						accurate and up to date. Under the Data Protection Act you have
						the right to see the personal information that we hold about
						you in our records. <br>
						All personal information is treated confidentially and is safely
						stored on our computer, with security systems preventing unauthorised
						access.</p>

						3. Confidentiality</strong></p>
					<p>We will endeavour to treat all your personal information as
						private and confidential. Other than under the terms of this
						privacy statement we will not disclose any of your information
						to anyone. <br>
						We would like to bring your attention to our obligations to
						disclose information in the following exceptional cases permitted
						by law. These are<br>

						insurer or the third party’s solicitor.<br>
						As highlighted in our Terms Of Business, your policy details
						will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID). The MID

						Vehicle Licensing and by the Police for the purposes of establishing
						whether a driver’s use of the vehicle is likely to be
						covered by a motor insurance policy and/or for preventing and
						detecting crime. If you are involved in an accident, the MID
						maybe used by Insurers, MIIC and the Motor Insurer’s Bureau
						to identify relevant policy information. People pursuing a claim
						in respect of a road traffic accident may also obtain relevant
						information held on the MID. For more information visit www.miic.org.uk<br>
						Ebike Insurance will also pass information to the Claims and
						Underwriting Exchange Register which is run by Insurance Database
						Services Limited (IDS Ltd), and the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud
						and Theft register, run by the Association of British Insurers
						(ABI). The aim is to help us to check information provided and
						also prevent fraudulent claims. When dealing with your request
						for insurance these registers maybe searched. When you inform
						us of an incident, we will pass this information relating to
						it to the registers.</p>

						4. Information Security</strong></p>
					<p>How we protect your personal information from misuse and abuse
						is of great importance to us. We are constantly reviewing and
						enhancing our technical and physical security procedures to
						protect your personal data from unauthorised access.</p>
					<p>You will only be able to access your policy by inputting your
						unique policy number and your email address. The eBike Insurance
						site also uses secure socket layer (SSL) 128-bit encryption
						technology to encrypt sensitive information such as your financial
						information.<br>

						a secure server. </p>
