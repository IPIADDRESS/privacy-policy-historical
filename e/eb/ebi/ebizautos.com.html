	<h3>EBIZAUTOS AND LOOKSLIKE, INC. ARE COMMITTED TO YOUR PRIVACY!</h3>
	
	<p>Your privacy is important, so we have created the following Privacy Policy to 
	let you know what information we collect when you visit our web site, why we 
	collect it, and how it is used. This Privacy Policy applies to all information 
	that you provide to Lookslike, Inc. and that Lookslike, Inc. maintains 
	electronically, whether you provide the information through www.ebizautos.com 
	(the "Site"), or through other means. Additionally, this Privacy Policy applies 
	to any personal information obtained from your (and, if applicable, your 
	family's) use of the Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information 
	that you may provide to third parties; for example, other sites linked to this 
	Site. You should contact such third parties directly to determine their 
	respective privacy policies. This Privacy Policy is governed by our
	<a href="terms-of-use.cfm" title="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a>. We may 
	periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy. It is your responsibility to 
	review this Privacy Policy frequently and remain informed about any changes to 
	it, so we encourage you to visit this page often. We believe very strongly that 
	private information should remain private. We would like to hear your feedback 
	about this statement. If you have comments or questions, please e-mail us by 
	clicking <a href="mailto:support@ebizautos.com" title="here">here</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN</h3>
	
	<p>This Site is not intended for or directed to persons under the age of 18. Lookslike, 
	Inc. does not provide services for children. Lookslike, Inc. does not knowingly 
	solicit data from children and does not knowingly market to children. By 
	providing Lookslike, Inc. with any information, you represent to Lookslike, Inc. 
	that you are 18 years of age or older.</p>

	
	<h3>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU? WHY? </h3>
	
	<p>We collect and maintain a variety of information about you to assist you in the 
	management of your auction inventory. The information we maintain includes, 
	among other things:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Your name, your phone number and address (street and e-mail)</li>
	<li>Information about your dealership</li>
	<li>Information on motor vehicles you submit through this Site in accord with 
	our Terms of Service</li>

	</ul>
	<p>Lookslike, Inc. is NOT in the business of selling, 
	renting, or sharing your personally identifiable information to others and we 
	disclose "personally identifiable" information only in the following ways.</p>
	
	<p>We will only export data and information you provide us on this Site in 
	accord with our Terms of Service. We also use your information for other things 
	that may include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
	
	<h3>CONTACTING YOU</h3>
	
	<p>Lookslike, Inc. uses your personally identifiable information to communicate with you in 
	the event we have any questions with regard to your online information form. We 
	may also contact you to tell you about products and services provided by our 
	other affiliates and other third-party organizations.</p>
	
	<h3>USE OF COOKIES</h3>

	<p>Cookies are a standard technology used by commercial web services to store small pieces 
	of information on your hard drive by sending a small string of text to your 
	browser. They make your use of this Site more pleasing and efficient by 
	"personalizing" your user interface, for example, or identifying which parts of 
	a site you have previously visited. They also enable us to pre-populate, or 
	automatically fill out, forms and schedules, or to assist you in visiting 
	multiple pages within the Site during the same session without having to 
	re-enter your password multiple times. For your convenience, we also use 
	longer-lasting cookies to display your email address on our sign-in form so that 
	you do not have to retype your email address each time you log in to your 
	eBizAutos account. They enable us to tailor the information you receive and to 
	assist third party organizations with whom we have strategic alliances by 
	identifying you as a Lookslike, Inc. client, employee or eBizAutos website user. 
	Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, unless you have configured yours 
	not to accept them. In order for us to provide you with services on eBizAutos, 
	your browser must accept cookies, as they are essential for site administration 
	and security. Lookslike, Inc. does not use cookies either to collect 
	individually identifiable information or to collect non-individually 
	identifiable information using a cookie that is combined with a personal 
	identifier.</p>
	
	<h3>USE OF IP ADDRESS</h3>
	<p>IP addresses are numbers that are automatically assigned to your computer, and, if 
	associated with other individually identifiable information, could be considered 
	personal information. User IP address information is used only for our internal 
	tracking purposes.</p>
	
	<h3>CERTAIN EXCEPTIONAL DISCLOSURES </h3>
	<p>We may disclose your information if necessary to protect our legal rights, if the 
	information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct, or Lookslike, Inc. 
	has good faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to the 
	requirements of law or comply with governmental orders, court orders, or legal 
	process served on eBizAutos or Lookslike, Inc., or (2) to protect and defend the 
	property or rights of Lookslike, Inc., the users of this Site or the public. 
	This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for 
	fraud protection and credit risk protection. If Lookslike, Inc. should ever file 
	for bankruptcy, be acquired by, or merge with another company, we may sell the 
	information you provide to us on the this Site to a third party or share your 
	personal information with the acquiring or merging company.</p>
	
	<h3>HOW DO WE PROTECT INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</h3>

	
	<p>We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store 
	certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and 
	management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity 
	of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we 
	believe the measures implemented by our web site reduce the likelihood of 
	security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. Your 
	information is protected in accordance with our <a href="security.cfm" title="Security Policy">Security Policy</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP USER INFORMATION? </h3>
	
	<p>We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we 
	reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according to changing 
	requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage 
	space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In 
	addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain 
	indefinitely. Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to 
	the extent feasible and within our direct control. Please note that we have 
	greater control over recently collected data than over archived data. Once data 
	is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate 
	specific requests. In those cases, our general data retention policy applies.</p>
	
	<h3>YOUR CONSENT TO THIS POLICY </h3>
	
	<p>By using this Site, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This is our entire and 
	exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. Our
	<a href="terms-of-use.cfm" title="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a> take 
	precedence over any conflicting Policy provision. We may change our Privacy 
	Policy by posting a new version of the policy on this page, which it is your 
	responsibility to review frequently.</p>
