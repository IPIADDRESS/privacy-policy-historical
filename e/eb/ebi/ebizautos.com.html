		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

		<h2>LOOKSLIKE, INC. IS COMMITTED TO YOUR PRIVACY!</h2>
			
		<p>We value Your patronage and respect Your privacy rights.  As part of the 
		normal operation of Our services, We collect and, in some cases, may disclose information about You.  We have created 
		the following Privacy Policy to let You know what information We collect when You visit Our Sites, why We collect it, 
		and how it is used.  This Privacy Policy applies to all information that You provide to Lookslike, Inc. ("Us," "We," or "Our") 
		and that We maintain electronically, whether You provide the information through Our Sites, or through other means.  
		Additionally, this Privacy Policy applies to any Personal Information (defined below) obtained from Your use of any websites 
		operated by Us, including any site from which You accessed this policy, which may include eBizAutos.com and/or Zibe.com 
		(collectively, the "Sites").  This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information that You may provide to third parties; 
		for example, other sites linked to Our Sites.  You should contact such third parties directly to determine their 
		respective privacy policies.</p>
		
		<p>This Privacy Policy is governed by Our <a href="terms-of-use.cfm" title="Terms of Use" onclick="window.open(this.href,'privacy'); return false;">Terms of Use</a>, 
		which is incorporated herein by reference.  We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy.  In such an event, 
		We will send You an email containing the revised terms or a notification containing a link to where the revised terms 
		can be viewed at least three (3) days before they go into effect.  If You do not expressly object to the validity of 
		the new terms and conditions via e-mail within this three (3) day period, then the newly revised Privacy Policy will be 
		considered agreed upon.  If You reject the newly revised Privacy Policy, then We may terminate Our relationship with You.  
		If You believe We have not adhered to this Privacy Policy or if You have any other questions regarding this Privacy Policy, 
		please contact Us at <a href="mailto:support@ebizautos.com" title="support@ebizautos.com">support@ebizautos.com</a>. </p>
		
		<h3>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU AND WHY? </h3>
		
		<p>We collect and maintain a variety of Personal Information about You to 
		enable Us to provide You with the best service. "Personal Information" is information about You by which You may be identified.  
		We currently collect Personal Information through e-mail and the various online inquiry forms on Our Sites.  The Personal 
		Information we collect and maintain about you includes:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>your name, </li>
			<li>your email address, </li>
			<li>your phone number, </li>
			<li>your zip code, </li>
			<li>and any information we receive from you on our credit application form.</li>			
		</ul>
		
		<p>We only collect Personal Information that you voluntarily provide to us.*
		We also use Your Personal Information for other things that may include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><span>Contacting You</span><br>
				We may use Your Personal Information to communicate with You in the event We have any questions with regard 
				to any online inquiry You may have or if, in accord with Our Terms and Conditions, We need to contact you.  
				We may also contact You to tell You about products and services provided by Our Partners, other affiliates and 
				other third-party organizations.
			</li>
			<li><span>Interactions</span><br>
				Each time You interact with Our Sites, the details of Your interaction are 
				collected and retained by Us.
			</li>
			<li><span>Correspondence</span><br>
				We intend to retain any correspondence, including facsimiles, mail and e-mails, set to Us.  
				We also may retain correspondence such as customer service e-mails from Us to You.  We may delete such records over time.
			</li>				
			<li><span>Use of IP Address</span><br>
				IP addresses are numbers that are automatically assigned to Your computer, and, if associated 
				with other individually identifiable information, could be considered personal information.  Your user IP address information is used only for 
				Our internal tracking and marketing purposes.
			</li>
			<li><span>Use of Cookies</span><br>
				Cookies are a standard technology used by commercial web services to store small pieces of 
				information on your hard drive by sending a small string of text to your browser. They make Your use of Our Sites more pleasing and efficient 
				by "personalizing" Your user interface, for example, or identifying which parts of a site You have previously visited. They also enable Us 
				to pre-populate, or automatically fill out, forms and schedules, or to assist You in visiting multiple pages within Our Sites during the same 
				session without having to re-enter your password multiple times.  For Your convenience, We also use longer-lasting cookies to display Your 
				email address on Our sign-in form so that You do not have to retype your email address each time You log in to Your Account on any of Our Sites.  
				Cookies enable us to tailor the information You receive and to assist our Partners by identifying You as having an Account with Us.  
				Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, unless You have configured Yours not to accept them. In order for Us to provide You with services
				on Our Sites, Your browser must accept cookies, as they are essential for site administration and security. We do not use cookies either to 
				collect individually identifiable information or to collect non-individually identifiable information using a cookie that is combined with a 
				personal identifier.
			</li>				
		</ul>

		<h3>WHAT GENERAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU AND WHY?</h3>

		
		<p>"General Information" is information about You or Your activities on Our Sites that do not identify You 
		personally.  When You use the Internet, Your web browser or software may communicate certain information to the host websites You visit.  
		This information may include the unique number assigned to Your server or Internet connection, the capabilities and features of Your computer, 
		You geographic location, and Your movement and activity within a particular Site.  We collect the same information on all of Our Sites.  We use this 
		General Information to generate statistics about visitors to Our Sites.</p>
		
		<h3>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
	
		<p>The information We collect is used to (i) to respond to Your inquiries; (ii) provide customer services and 
		resolve any complaints; (iii) improve Our Sites and service and resolve any technical problems; (iv) communicate with You concerning the products and 
		services offered on the Sites by Us or any of Our Partners; (v) cross-reference with other Personal Information that We have acquired about You or may 
		acquire about You through other sources; (vi) create aggregate data; (vii) ensure compliance with the Our Terms of Use; and (viii) comply with any 
		applicable laws and regulations.  We may provide Your information to government officials and agencies as required by law, and Partners as part of 
		business operations, transaction processing, and marketing efforts, as identified below.  For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Partner” shall mean 
		any person or entity with whom We enter into any kind of business transaction who is under an obligation to Us to use reasonable care to keep Personal 
		Information confidential.</p>
		
		<h3>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT </h3>
		
		<p>Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, We will not sell, trade, or disclose to third parties any 
		Personal Information obtained by Us through Our Sites or from Our Partners about You. <strong> If disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we cannot control, and are not responsible for, the manner 
		in which any of such companies and other entities use Your Personal Information. </strong>  We may disclose Personal Information (i) to companies and other entities who 
		work with Us or those companies to fulfill Your request; (ii) to companies that help process the transactions You request, in order to protect Your 
		transactions from fraud and verify Your identity; (iii) that We in good faith believe is necessary or appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud, 
		intellectual property infringements or other activity that is illegal or may expose Us or You to legal liability, or to conduct investigations of violations 
		of the Our Terms of Use; (iv) when required by law or to comply with a court order, subpoena, search warrant or other legal process; (v) to comply with legal, 
		regulatory or administrative requirements of governmental authorities (including, without limitation, requests from the governmental agency authorities to view 
		Your Personal Information); (vi) to protect and defend Us, Our subsidiaries and affiliates and any of their officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, 
		contractors and partners, in connection with any legal action, claim or dispute; (vii) to prevent imminent physical harm; (viii) to share aggregated statistical 
		or demographic data with Our affiliates, business partners or for public relations (this aggregated information is not tied to Personal Information); (ix) to 
		provide data, including Personal Information about You, with Our parent, affiliates, subsidiaries and Partners; (x) to sell or otherwise provide to third parties 
		in the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation; and (xi) to sell or otherwise provide to third parties in the event of a future merge or acquisition by another company.  
		In the event We merge or are acquired by another company, the successor company will have access to Your Personal Information in order to continue to provide services, 
		but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended as described in the subsection labeled "Changes to this Privacy Policy" below.</p>

		
		<h3>HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
		
		<p>At times, We offer secure Web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and We store certain kinds of 
		data in encrypted form.  We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored 
		on Our system.  Although no computer system is completely secure, We believe the measures implemented on Our Sites reduce the likelihood of security 
		problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. </p>
		
		<h3>HOW LONG WE KEEP USER INFORMATION</h3>
	
		<p>We generally keep user data on Our server or in Our archives for as long as We reasonably need it.  We may 
		alter this practice according to changing requirements.  For example, We may delete some data if needed to free up storage space.  We may keep other data 
		for longer periods if the law requires it.  In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely.</p>

		<p>Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within Our direct 
		control.  Please note that We have greater control over recently collected data than over archived data.  Once data is removed from the system and archived, 
		it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests.  In those cases, Our general data retention policy applies.</p>
		
		<h3>PERSONAL CHOICE IN THE DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

		
		<p>If You do not want Us to share Your Personal Information with Our Partners for marketing purposes, or if You do 
		not want to receive certain communications and offers from Us You can “opt out” of such sharing, communications and offers by visiting <a href="mailto:support@ebizautos.com" title="support@ebizautos.com">support@ebizautos.com</a>. </p>

		an e-mail message to <a href="mailto:support@ebizautos.com" title="support@ebizautos.com">support@ebizautos.com</a> explaining the correction or change and 
		providing any relevant confirmation or reference number.</p>
		
		<h3>SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN</h3>

		
		<p>Our Sites are targeted primarily for use by persons 18 years of age and older.  
		We do not currently market to or create special areas for use by children.  Accordingly, We do not knowingly collect age 
		identifying information, nor do We knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13 years.  
		However, We hereby advise all visitors to Our site under the age of 13 not to disclose or provide any Personal Information 
		on Our Sites.  In the event that We discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to Us, 
		in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (please see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at 
		www.ftc.gov for more information about this Act), We will delete the child’s Personal Information from Our 
		files to the extent technologically possible.</p>
	
		<h3>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
