    </div>
    <h3>We Use  Common Tracking Tools</h3>
    <p>We or  vendors we have hired use several common tracking technologies. These may include  browser and flash cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies. </p>
                <h3>Our  Tracking May Be Used to Serve Ads</h3>
                <p>We use  common tracking tools to decide which ads to insert into the  pages you visit.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>As  part of this customization, we (or companies we work with) observe your  behavior on this website to provide you with ads that are related to the  searches you run on our website. </li>
                  <li>We  may also get information about your browsing history on other websites from our  trusted business partners. We use this information to provide you with ads on  our website related to your browsing history outside of our website. </li>
                  <li>Additionally,  trusted business partners may use your behavior on this website to decide which  ads to show you on other websites. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>You Can  Control Cookies</h3>
                <p>You can  control cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. To reject browser  cookies, you must set your browser to reject browser cookies. To control flash  cookies, <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">click here</a>. Why?  Because flash cookies do not reside in your browser, and therefore your browser  settings will not affect them. If you configure your computer to block cookies,  you may not be able to access certain functionality on our sites.&nbsp; </p>
                <h3>You Can  Control Tracking-Based Ads</h3>
                <p>Many of the  ad networks we work with participate in the Self-Regulatory Program for Online  Behavioral Advertising. This program allows consumers to opt-out of having  their online behavior tracked for advertising purposes. If you want to opt out, <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
                  <h3>We Also Use Common Tracking Tools for  Non-Advertising Purposes</h3>
    <ul type="disc">
                  <li>To understand our subscribers and       website visitors so that we may improve our sites</li>
                  <li>To track new visitors to our websites.</li>
                  <li>To recognize past subscribers.</li>
                  <li>To store your password if you are       registered on our website</li> <br><br>
    </ul>
                <center><span class="copyHeader2">Privacy Policy</span></center><br>
    <p align="left">Our Users are able  to visit many of our website pages without telling us who they are or revealing  any information about themselves. We may track IP addresses from which Users  visit us and analyze this data in the aggregate to determine usage for trends  and statistics. Users remain anonymous unless they voluntarily tell us who they  are.</p>
                  
<h3>Personal Information (“PII”) We Collect and How We Use It. </h3>

<p>We ask Users to provide certain  PII about themselves when they sign up for subscriptions, make purchases in our  store, or contribute content to a Britannica site. PII means your&nbsp; name, address, telephone number, e-mail  address, and/or credit or charge card information. It is up to you whether you  provide any PII; however, you must provide some PII to purchase a subscription  or submit content or make a store purchase.&nbsp;  When you provide your PII with your content submissions, realize we have  no control over how other Users will use that information. </p>

<p>Britannica uses PII for:  allowing Users to obtain an account and to receive communications; verifying  the identities of contributors of content; making ongoing enhancements to the  sites; marketing and promotional purposes; and evaluating site usage by  analyzing PII and related data in the aggregate. In addition, with respect to  Britannica site Users located outside North America, we may share pertinent PII  with our local subsidiaries.</p>
                  
<p>We may share PII with: </p>

<p><strong>Authorized service providers.</strong> We may share PII with service providers that perform certain services on our  behalf, such as &nbsp;processing credit card  payments, performing business and sales  analysis,  and supporting our Web site functionality. </p>

<p><strong>Business partners.</strong> When you  make purchases or engage in our promotions, we may share PII with the  businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services,  promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes. When you elect to engage in a particular merchant's offer or program, you authorize us to provide your email  address and other information to that merchant.</p>

<p><strong>Direct mail partners.</strong> From time  to time we may share our postal mailing list with selected providers of goods  and services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive  mailings from these providers, you can notify us at any time by following the  instructions set forth below <em>in "How to Opt Out, Correct, Update, or  Remove Personal Information.</em>"</p>

<p><strong>Law enforcement. </strong>We also may disclose your information:In  response to a subpoena or as otherwise required by law. When we believe  disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent,  or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other  wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Britannica,  our Users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate  with law enforcement; or to enforce our Web site terms and conditions or other  agreements or policies. </p>

<p><strong>Purchasers of our business.</strong> In connection with a  substantial  corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger,  consolidation or asset sale.&nbsp; Our privacy  policy would continue to cover your PII. </p>
<br>


<h3>Prospect and Referral Information</h3>

<p>If a  User visits a Britannica site and submits an e-mail address to Britannica but  fails to complete the registration or purchase process, we may use such  "prospect" information to contact the prospective User from time to  time with Britannica offers and information about new features, new services,  and special discounts we think the User may see as valuable. Similarly, if a  User forwards a Britannica e-mail to a friend, we may use the  "referral" information provided to contact the friend from time to  time with Britannica offers and information about new features, new services,  and special discounts we think the friend may see as valuable. We do not sell  or rent any contact information for such "prospects" or  "referrals." </p><br>

<h3>Non-Personally identifiable  Information (“Non-PII”) We Collect and How We Use It</h3>
                  
<p>Like other commercial websites, we collect information about consumer  activities and behaviors to improve our websites, provide standard advertising  controls, to determine user response to advertisements and promotions, to  deliver targeted advertisements that we or our partners believe will be of most  interest to you, and to prepare aggregate reports. </p>
 
 <p>Non-PII collected includes the  following: IP address, domain, browser type and language, referring website addresses,  date/time of visits, page view data, and search keywords. Non-PII is collected  using the following standard web technologies:</p>
    <ul>
                    <li>“Cookies” are data files, which often include an  anonymous unique identifier, sent to your browser from a website. Cookies can  only be read by the party placing the cookie, they cannot erase or alter any of  your data and when used in the context of collecting non-PII, they do not  include personal data. For more information about cookies visit<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank"> http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</li>
                    <li>“Log files” track actions occurring on sites and  collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service  provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, click data and  types of advertisements viewed.</li>
                    <li>“Web beacons” are electronic files used to track  your navigation of a website or collection of sites, and browsing behavior.</li>
    </ul>

                <p>Collectively these technologies  enable us to better understand our Users. Cookies do not allow us to gather any  PII.</p>

<p><strong>Demographic Information. </strong>At  times we ask subscribers to provide us with demographic or profile information  regarding their preferences and interests. This demographic information is not  required. We use aggregated demographic information to draw conclusions about  Users' wishes and preferences. We also provide demographic User information in  the aggregate to third parties in connection with advertising campaigns. You may  withdraw your consent at any time by following the instructions provided under  the heading "<em>How to Opt Out, Correct, Update, or Remove Personal  Information</em>" below.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies and Beacons – Use by Britannica.</strong> To help  you personalize your online experience, Britannica uses "Cookies."  "Cookies" are small files that Britannica transfers to Users’ browers  or, in the case of mobile sites, to Users’ devices, for record-keeping  purposes. One of the primary purposes of Cookies is to provide a convenience  feature to save you time. For example, Cookies allow us to recognize you when  you re-enter a Britannica site so that you will not have to log in each time  you visit. Cookies also allow us to collect anonymous traffic data, such as the  number of unique and return visitors who use the Britannica sites. In addition,  Britannica places Cookies with Users visiting from advertising banners and hyperlinks  on other  sites to track the success of a particular advertising campaign or  marketing program. Most browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies. If you  prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you've received a Cookie  or, alternatively, to refuse to accept Cookies. It is important to note that  you may not be able to use certain features on a Britannica site if you choose  not to accept Cookies. The use of Cookies is an industry standard and occurs at  most major websites. To manage browser cookies, please see your browser's  privacy settings. To manage Flash cookies, please use the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Adobe Flash Player Settings Manager</a>.</p>

<p>We use  web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one Britannica page  to another and to improve site performance. </p>
   
<p><strong>Cookies and Beacons – Use by Third Parties.</strong> Advertisers  and advertising networks use cookies and beacons to target ads served to Britannica.com.  What does it mean to "serve ads"? When you visit a website, your  Internet browser transmits a "request" to the computer that hosts the  website (the "host server") requesting that server to send you (or  "serve") the web page that you are seeking. Most web pages contain  components that are pulled from different sources, for example, a web page at a  news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports results  from a different source, and advertisements from other servers. Our web pages  contain coding that directs your browser to fill the ad spaces on the web pages  with content served by advertisers and networks of advertisers to whom we have  sold the ad spaces. The advertisers and networks use cookies and beacons to  help manage ad delivery and frequency, and to identify audience segment for  customized advertising ("targeting"). These cookies are used to  identify your IP address, so that when you visit another website using the  same advertising network, the network will recognize the cookie as one of its  own, read the information on the cookie (the record of which sites in the  network you have visited) and serve you an ad that you might be interested in,  based on your past visits to other sites in the network. Advertising targeted based  on past web surfing is known as "behavioral advertising."</p>

<p>Britannica  does not permit any advertisers or networks to collect PII about visitors to Britannica.com using cookies or beacons. Our  Privacy Policy does not cover the use of information that they may have  collected from you on other sites. If you would like to learn more about  behavioral advertising or to opt out of having this information used by  companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver  targeted ads, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>. Many of the same companies  are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.  You can learn more and opt out of receiving targeted ads from them at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</p>

<p>Some  advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links  below. When you opt-out of a network, you may receive an "opt-out"  cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the  future. You will continue to receive ads from that network, but not  behaviorally targeted ads. If you erase your browser's cookies, you may need to  perform this process again.</p>
