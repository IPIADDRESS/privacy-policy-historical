							you to have a positive experience at the web sites operated by the EBSCO 
							Information Services group and its two divisions, EBSCO Subscription Services 
							and EBSCO Publishing. We want you to know that your privacy rights will be 
							honored. EBSCO Information Services will never abuse your privacy rights. We 
							discuss our information collection practices below. </font>
					</p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This Privacy Policy sets forth 
							the privacy practices in effect at the EBSCO Information Services group 
							websites. If you do not agree to these terms, do not access this web site. </font>
					</p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>What Information Is Collected 
								and How is it Used?</strong></font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>A. General Collection and Use 
									of Personal Identifying Information</strong><br>
								We will only collect and use personal identifying information (such as a first 
								and last name, physical address including a street name, e-mail address, etc.) 
								when a user voluntarily provides it to us. In order to use some portions of our 
								web sites, or in order to undertake certain actions (such as setting up an 
								account to make a purchase of an article), a user must first complete a 
								registration form or provide an e-mail address that will require disclosure of 
								personal identifying information. </font>
						</p>
						<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, the EBSCOhost 
								service available at the EBSCO Publishing web site employs a Personalization 
								feature that requires completion of a registration form before a user can use 
								that feature. The Personalization feature of EBSCOhost is a powerful tool that 
								provides users with the means to create and save histories of searches they 
								have conducted. We believe the Personalization feature is a useful tool that 
								will enhance the user's experience at the site, but it does require the user to 
								provide personal identifying information to us. </font>
						</p>
						<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We will use the personal 
								identifying information we collect for limited internal purposes that may 
								include, but are not limited to, processing your transactions, establishing the 
								identity of account holders, customer service, development, content processing, 
								content classification, and providing you with information concerning our 
								services. We will retain this information. We also may use that personal 
								identifying information to improve and customize our content. In order to 
								contact us by e-mail, you must provide an e-mail address.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We reserve the right to disclose 
								your personal identifying information if we are required to do so by law, or in 
								the good faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably 
								necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect or 
								advance the rights, property, safety, or well-being of our company, our 
								employees, customers, or the public.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
								<strong>B. Collection and Use of Information From Children</strong><br>
								Some pages at our sites, particularly at the EBSCO Publishing site, are 
								designed to be used by children. With respect to those pages, we comply with 
								the provisions of the Children's On-Line Privacy Protection Act 
								("COPPA"). Accordingly, at those pages designed for use by children, 
								we limit our collection of information to non-personal identifying information. 
								At those pages, we do not collect personal identifying information (such as 
								e-mail addresses, first and last name). We only use the non-personal 
								identifying information we collect for internal uses, such as improving and 
								customizing our content. We will not share or distribute this information to 
								any third party.</font></p>
						<p>
							<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
								<br>
								<strong>C. Collection of Non-Personal Identifying Information</strong><br>
								We collect and use non-personal identifying information, including IP addresses 
								and web server log files to track trends, administer the web site, track user 
								movement, and gather demographic information. We use this non-personal 
								identifying information in the aggregate. We do not combine these types of 
								non-personal identifying information with personal identifying information. We 
								may also share aggregated demographic information with our business partners, 
								sponsors, advertisers, and companies that control, are controlled by, or are 
								under common control with EBSCO Information Services. </font>
						</p>
						<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cookies and Web Service Log File 
								Data<br>
								We may place a "cookie" or other tracking or information gathering 
								device used in the industry in the browser files of a user's computer. A cookie 
								is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about 
								the user. Cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to 
								enhance the experience on our web site. We are able to access only the cookies 
								that our sites set on your computer and we are only able to determine the type 
								of computer operating system and browser that you are using. We collect 
								information from cookies and other information gathering devices and log files 
								in the aggregate. We do not link the information collected through cookies or 
								other devices to personal information that users submit online while 
								participating in our activities. Users can set their browsers or third party 
								software to reject cookies. If a user rejects the cookie, the user may be 
								unable to use portions of our web site. Some of the web sites we provide links 
								to also may use cookies. As noted in the "Links to Third Party Sites" 
								section of the Legal/Trademark section of our site, we have no control over 
								these linked web sites or access to or control over cookies or other technology 
								used by linked web sites.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information for Parents<br>
								Most of the EBSCO Information Services sites are not directed toward children 
								(as defined by COPPA) and these sites are not designed to collect personal 
								identifying information from children. A few pages at our sites, particularly 
								at the EBSCO Publishing site, contain publications that are designed to be used 
								by children. At those pages, we do not collect personal identifying 
								information. At the remaining EBSCO Information Services sites, children should 
								not provide information on these sites, and should ask a parent help them. We 
								urge parents to experience the World Wide Web with their children. If parents 
								have any suggestions or comments please e-mail or write us. Go to Contact Us.<br>
								<br>
								Security<br>
								EBSCO Information Services has taken steps to ensure that personal identifying 
								information collected in the future is secure, and we have limited the number 
								of people who have access to the information, by electronic security systems 
								and password protections that guard against unauthorized access. EBSCO 
								Information Services provides links to web sites outside of EBSCO Information 
								Services. These web sites may not have the same privacy policies as EBSCO 
								Information Services. EBSCO Information Services takes reasonable care in 
								recommending these web sites but is not responsible for their content or 
								privacy policies. We urge users to read the privacy statement of an outside web 
								site when leaving our site and linking to an outside web site. </font>
