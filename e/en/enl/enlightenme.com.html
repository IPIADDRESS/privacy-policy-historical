<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">None of this information is associated with you as an individual (see information about cookies below). We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and to make the Web site easier for you and other visitors to use.
<br>
<br>
<b>What about pages that ask for personal information?</b>
<br>
When visitors supply information about themselves for a specific purpose, we use the information for that purpose (such as to provide the service or information the visitor has requested). For example, you may be asked to give us individual information to purchase a product or service, receive information, manage online account registration, or apply for a job. The information may range from your zip code, to your phone number, account number, a credit card number, age, gender, mother's maiden name, social security number, e-mail address, organization URL, resume, or mailing address.<br><br>
When visitors use our Web site to order services, we may use this personally identifiable information as we would use the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner. For example, to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a non-published number), or to evaluate your service needs and contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. If you do not want us to contact you, you can remove your name from our telephone or mail solicitation lists by clicking on <a href="http://www.superpages.com/about/contact.html">Contact Us</a>. Please note that this removes your name from SuperPages and BigBook, however, to be removed from other websites in the Verizon family of companies ("Verizon Family"), contact them directly.<br><br>Verizon does not knowingly collect information from children through this web site.  This web site, and any web site to which users may link from this web site, may contain content provided by advertisers or other third parties that may not be suitable for children.  Verizon asks parents or legal guardians to assist Verizon by supervising the activities of children at this web site.
<br>
<br>
<b>What happens to information when I fill out registration forms?</b> <br>
The registration forms request accurate contact information (like name and e-mail address) and preferences that help us better serve you. Your name and e-mail address are used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters. You may change your email, user ID or password online; or you can choose to remove your name from our user list by going to Contact Us and emailing us a request to remove your name. 
<br>
<br>
To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand the site's capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future. We will update this privacy statement as policies change to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Do you sell or give my information to companies outside of the "Verizon Family?"</b> 
<br>
We do not sell or disclose personally identifiable information obtained online about our visitors, to anyone outside of the "Verizon Family" unless you specifically authorize it, to complete a transaction that you initiated, it is required by law, or disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property. If you provide personally identifiable information to us in the context of an event Verizon sponsors with another company, such as a contest, or if you register on a co-sponsored site or feature, you may also be providing the personally identifiable information to the co-sponsor. This will be made clear to you before you submit the information and you can decide whether or not to participate. 
<br>
<br>
Verizon may share non-personally identifiable information with non-"Verizon Family" companies in order to assess the results of a promotion, event or third party relationship, to provide information to current or prospective customers, to complete a search or to otherwise enhance your online experience.

<b>Do you accommodate links to other sites?</b> <br>
This website contains links to other web sites.  These other web sites may, among other things, allow you to bid on and/or purchase products that you initially viewed on this web site. These other web sites may (or may not) be co-branded with Verizon or SuperPages.com or BigBook branding.

If the second level domain of the URL for the page containing the link is different than the second level domain of the URL for the page to which you have linked, you have linked to a different web site.  For example, if you link from a page located at the URL <u>www.thirdleveldomain.superpages.com</u> to a page located at the URL <u>www.superpages.secondleveldomain.com</u>, you have linked to another site. Please note that any of Verizon's trademarks or service marks  (e.g., SuperPages, BigBook, etc) may be included in the URL of a co-branded or private label web site that is owned and operated by a third party, in a location other than that occupied by the second level domain (e.g., as the third level domain).</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The companies that own or operate these web sites may track and/or collect information about you, but Verizon does not have control over the privacy practices (including, without limitation, those relating to tracking user activity, collection of user data, use of user data, and security) of these companies (although, when a user activates a link from this web site one of these other web sites, Verizon may pass the user's referral URL and IP address to the server hosting such other site). We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices (including, without limitation, those related to tracking, collection, use and security) employed by (or in connection with) other sites, and we are not responsible for the content on, or operation of, other sites (including, without limitation, any transactions conducted through such other sites).

<b>What is Verizon's position regarding online advertising and third party ad servers? </b><br>
Verizon accepts advertisements from third parties that serve advertising into the SuperPages and/or BigBook sites.

Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. To disable cookies, see "Setting Cookie Preferences" at the end of this policy. 
<br>
<br>
However, you need to understand that some websites/ad serving companies have the ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion, if you reenter the same site on another occasion, or some other site tracked by the ad serving company/network, and specifically provide personal data. 
<br>
<br>
Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent ad serving companies from reestablishing history on a visitor. The visitor must either continue to decline cookies each time it reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or opt-out. When you opt-out, your unique user ID cookie is erased and you are reassigned an anonymous, non-id cookie. This new cookie tells websites that you have opted out and they will then know not to attempt to assign other cookies to you in the future. Opt-out cookies do not contain a unique user ID number therefore websites are not able to identify your computer uniquely. 
<br>
<br>
Customers who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have their browser advise them each time a web site attempts to send a cookie to your system. At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel a cookie.

<br>
Customers who choose to "opt out" after deleting cookies will receive an anonymous/non personally identifiable cookie.

<b>Who do I contact if I am concerned about online advertising and privacy?</b> 
<br>
All concerns or questions about your privacy related to online advertising should be addressed through our Customer Care Center which can be reached by clicking on <a href="http://www.superpages.com/about/contact.html">Contact Us</a>. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Does Verizon use the information provided online to profile its customers?</b> 
<br>
The combination of offline and online information provided by the customer has the ability to enhance the customer experience, and make the consumer's interaction with Verizon more meaningful and relevant. Verizon requires notification of any consumer profiling or purchasing behavior being captured by Verizon online and combined with offline information be clearly stated to the consumer at the time of online data collection. The consumer will have the ability to choose not to have that information aggregated and be part of subsequent marketing campaigns by so indicating at the point of the application, or by choosing to Opt-Out of future marketing campaigns from Verizon by clicking on <a href="http://www.superpages.com/about/contact.html">Contact Us</a>.

<b>How do I know I am on a secured site?</b> <br>
Every secure page on this web site has been secured with a digital certificate. You know you are on a secure page of this web site when you see a lock in the status bar at the bottom of your browser. In Internet Explorer, you can view your status bar by clicking on View, Status Bar. When you see the lock, double click it and a popup window opens and displays who issued the digital certificate securing that page and the dates it is valid. 
<br>
<br>
<b>How does Verizon prevent unauthorized access to my account information?</b> <br>
Your password is set at a minimum of six characters, which provides added protection for your personal information. On secured pages, this site uses SSL encryption up to 128-bits. 
<br>
<br>
<b>What security measures are in place to restrict access to personal data?</b> <br>
There are a variety of security measures in place that limits internal access to data stored by the Verizon site. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only and requires an employee to have a secure ID and password to access the information. In addition, logs are reviewed regularly to spot any inconsistencies. The site is continually updated with the latest known security patches that are periodically published by the system vendor. Any information that you give is password protected. For your protection, the system automatically locks out a user after 3 incorrect tries and after 20 minutes of idle time per secure session. If you forget your password, you will be prompted to supply your customer ID number and your password will be e-mailed to you.
<br>
<br>
<b>What information is stored by the site or in cookies?</b> <br>
Registration information, bill and online shopping, data and contact e-mail addresses are stored in Verizon databases which are physically secure environments that are not accessible via the Internet. This information is only available to you through the use of a secure ID and password, and the information is transferred from our databases for your viewing.
