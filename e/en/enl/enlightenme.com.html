In some cases, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information that you provide, such as search parameters in connection with a search you conduct through This Website, ratings and reviews, and zip code.</p>
<p>To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand This Website’s capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future. We will update this Privacy Policy as our practices change to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.</p>
<h3>How does Dex Media use, store and share information collected on This Website?</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific Purpose</span>. When users supply personally identifiable information about themselves for a specific purpose (for example, to register to use a feature on This Website, to purchase a product or service, to obtain a free listing, to register for a program or to use a feature of a program, to receive information, or to apply for a job), we may use, store, and/or share such information for such purpose.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Similar to Information Collected in Traditional Non-Electronic Manner</span>. We also may use, store and/or share personally identifiable information users provide as we would use, store and/or share the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner. For example, we may use such personally identifiable information to assess your credit rating. We may also use store and/or share this information to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a non-published number), to contact you in connection with a program you are participating in, user reviews and/or to evaluate your service needs, and to contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. When users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a feature on This Website, we may also use, store and/or share such personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of such feature. (For example, if you register to use the personalized directory service, we may use the personally identifiable information you provide to provide you with a more personalized and useful service, and if you create a review of a business on This Website, we may publish your initials, city and state in connection with such review.) When users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion that we may run on This Website, we may use, store and/or share such information to administer such contest, sweepstakes or promotion and to notify winners.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Communicate with You</span>. We may also use, store and/or share personally identifiable information you provide or that is automatically collected to communicate with you (e.g., to send you e-mails) and to otherwise serve you. For example, we may use your name and e-mail address to send you e-mails to (a) provide information regarding our company, marketing information about our products and services or the products and services of other companies, and newsletters, (b) conduct online surveys, (c) confirm your registration on This Website, a service registration, or orders placed online and (d) otherwise communicate with you. However, you may request not to receive (i.e., “opt-out” of receiving) commercial e-mail messages (the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service) from us (on a category-by-category basis), by clicking on <a href="http://account.dexmedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp" target="_blank">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page. If you have previously opted out of receiving commercial e-mail messages related to one or more categories, you may cancel your request to opt-out of (i.e., consent to receive commercial e-mail messages from us related to) such categories (on a category-by-category basis) by clicking on <a href="http://account.dexmedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp" target="_blank">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page. Please note that we reserve the right to send certain types of e-mail messages that are not subject to opt-out (see information about <a href="#email">e-mails</a>, below) to online users, including those who have opted out of receiving commercial e-mail messages. Your personally identifiable information may also be used, stored and/or shared by non-“Dex Media Family” companies, with which we have agreements, to provide you information about their products and services.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Protect Dex Media’s Property or Other Rights</span>. In addition, Dex Media may use, store and/or share personally identifiable information you provide and information Dex Media automatically collects through This Website (and may combine personally identifiable information you provide with information Dex Media automatically collects through This Website and non-personally identifiable information you knowingly provide) as it deems appropriate to protect its property or other rights (for example, to enforce any policies or contractual provisions regarding use of the “ratings and reviews” feature or the “send a listing” feature).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Improve Website and Targeted Advertising</span>. We use, store and/or share information Dex Media automatically collects through This Website to improve This Website, to monitor its performance, to make This Website easier for you and other users to use, to manage features and programs made available through This Website and to provide behavioral tracking data to non-“Dex Media Family” companies, with which we have agreements, for the purpose of presenting you with, among other things, targeted advertising on third party websites. For example, Dex Media may use information Dex Media automatically collects in the ways described in the section entitled <a href="#Cookies">“What is a cookie and why does Dex Media use them?”</a>, below.</p>

When you provide your personally identifiable information to any third party, Dex Media is not responsible for any third party’s use of such personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Automatically Collected</span>. As indicated above, Dex Media may share information it automatically collects through This Website with non-“Dex Media Family” companies. Dex Media may share this information in order to assess the results of a promotion, event or third party relationship, to provide information to current or prospective customers, to complete a transaction, service, search or other activity that the user initiated or requested, to non-“Dex Media Family” companies, with which we have agreements, to, among other things, facilitate targeted advertising on third party websites, or to otherwise enhance your online experience.

These other sites may (or may not) be “co-branded” or “private-labeled” with (or otherwise contain) the Dex Media® name and logo, Superpages®, Superpages.com®, Localsearch.comSM, SuperGuarantee®, SuperpagesDirect®, SuperpagesMobile®, DirectoryStore®, SuperYellowPages.com®, SuperTradeExchange®, Dex®, Dex One®, Dex Media™, DexKnows®, DexKnows.com®, How Findable Are You?™ trademarks or other trademarks or branding of Dex Media. <strong>You can tell if you have linked from one site to another site by looking at the URL in the browser window (or, if the link opens a new browser window, by looking at the URL found by “right-clicking” on the page in the window and selecting “properties”). If the second level domain of the URL for the page containing the link is different than the second level domain of the URL for the page to which you have linked, you have linked to a different site.

<h2>Security</h2>
<h3>What security measures are in place to restrict access to personally identifiable information?</h3>
<p>Dex Media is committed to protecting your personally identifiable information that you provide through This Website. This Website is protected with a variety of security measures such as change control procedures and physical access controls (and passwords, as applicable). We also implement other control mechanisms in an effort to help protect personally identifiable information that you provide through This Website from being lost, misused or altered inappropriately.<br>
This Website supports 128 bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to transmit certain information (e.g., credit card information provided by the user and social security numbers provided by the user). SSL is a transport level technology for authentication and data encryption between a web server and a web browser. SSL sends data over the “socket”, which is a secure channel at the connection layer.</p>
<h2><a name="Cookies"></a>Cookies</h2>
<h3>What is a cookie and why does Dex Media use them?</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small data string our server writes to your device’s internal drive that contains your unique User ID for This Website. Cookies help us to identify new and returning users to This Website, analyze click-stream data, and track historical activity on This Website, which allows us to give you a more personalized, useful experience on This Website. Cookies may be placed by us, by a third-party that provides services to us, or a non-“Dex Media Family” company, with which we have an agreement.</p>
<p>Cookies help Dex Media to enhance the user’s online, mobile experience and can be used to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>deliver the appropriate geographic message</li>
<li>manage frequency of ad exposure; avoid over delivery of the same message</li>
<li>tailor an advertisement or other content to better match your interests and preferences</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>ensure that you see the correct products and pricing applicable to the state in which you live</li>
<li>keep track of your order as you order services</li>
<li>understand advertising effectiveness</li>
<li>manage features and programs made available through This Website</li>
<li>collect anonymous traffic data</li>
</ul>
<p>A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your device or computer. However, customers are free to delete website cookies. Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your device or computer, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.</p>
<p>You can choose to change your browser settings to disable cookies if you do not want us to establish and maintain a unique User ID. Please be aware that cookies may be required to complete certain functions on This Website, such as ordering products or services, and, also in connection with personalized sections of This website, for example My Superpages. To disable cookies, follow your browsers instructions. To opt-out of the placement of behavioral tracking cookies, see “How to Opt-out of Behavior Tracking Cookies” below.</p>
<p>However, you need to understand that some websites/ad serving companies have the ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion, if you reenter the same site on another occasion, or some other site tracked by the ad serving company/network, and specifically provide personal data.</p>
<p>Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent ad serving companies from reestablishing history on a user. The user must either continue to decline cookies each time it reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or opt-out. When you opt-out, your unique user ID cookie is erased and you are reassigned an anonymous, non-id cookie. This new cookie tells websites that you have opted out and they will then know not to attempt to assign other cookies to you in the future. Opt-out cookies do not contain a unique user ID number therefore websites are not able to identify your computer uniquely.</p>
<p>Users who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have their browser advise them each time a website attempts to send a cookie to your system. At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel a cookie. Users who choose to “opt out” after deleting cookies will receive an anonymous/non personally identifiable cookie.</p>
