<h2>Privacy Policy Effective Date / Updates</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of April 16, 2015. Our business changes constantly.

You are advised to check this web page (or such other page accessible by clicking on the Privacy Policy link in the footer of This Website) frequently to see recent changes.

<h2><a name="informationcollected"></a>Information Dex Media and Non-Dex Media Family Companies Collect, Store, and/or Share</h2>
<h3>What information does This Website gather, store and/or share?</h3>
<p>When you visit This Website, Dex Media may collect, store and/or share the following types of information:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide</li>
<li>Personally and Non-Personally Identifiable Information Dex Media Collects Automatically</li>
<li>Non-Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide</span>. Dex Media collects and may store and share personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide to us. For example, Dex Media may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information (such as name, address, e-mail address and telephone number). Dex Media will not share credit card information or social security numbers. If you purchase a product or service, Dex Media may ask you to provide additional information such as your credit card information. If you register for the SuperGuarantee® Program, Dex Media will ask you to provide additional information about any service appointment you register and may track your searches and any registrations, claims and ratings/reviews you file on This Website. If you file a claim under the SuperGuarantee® Program or apply for the Superpages LocalServe® Program, Dex Media may ask you to provide additional information such as your Social Security number. If you request information relating to the sale or purchase of a vehicle on This Website, we may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information and information relating to the vehicle. Finally, in some cases (for example, if you register with us or sign-in on This Website or purchase a product or service) Dex Media may also ask you to provide other information such as a personal ID, password, security question and answer, and birthday.</p>
<p>If you choose to use an available referral service on This Website (e.g., to send a postcard, listing, page link, contest invitation, etc.), we will ask for certain personal information from the recipient (e.g., the recipient’s name, e-mail address, mobile telephone number) and your name and e-mail address. Dex Media uses the personally identifiable referral information you provide to facilitate this communication on a one-time basis, and may also store and use such personally identifiable information for analysis purposes (e.g., tracking the success of the referral feature). You are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personally and Nonpersonally Information Automatically Collected</span>. In addition, as you (and other users) browse This Website, our web servers, and non “Dex Media Family” companies with which Dex Media has an agreement may, automatically collect and track certain information about such visits, usually through the use of browser <a href="#Cookies">cookies</a>, JavaScript files and tagging, web address tracking codes, file impression counts, “web beacons”, and the analysis of http headers (“Tracking Methods”). These Tracking Methods provide information such as the user’s IP address, the user’s domain name, the user’s browser type, the user’s user agent, how many users visit This Website, which pages the user visits and for how long, the date and time the user accesses This Website, the Internet address of the site from which the user directly linked to This Website and the links on This Website on which the user clicks. In addition, Dex Media may collect certain search parameters relating to searches conducted by the user which are not entered by the user.</p>
<p>Dex Media may collect and store information, including personally identifiable information, related to your usage of third-party sites that you access through the Websites, including emails that you send through the Websites.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide</span>. In some cases, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information that you provide, such as search parameters in connection with a search you conduct through This Website, ratings and reviews, and zip code.</p>
<p>To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand This Website’s capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future. We will update this Privacy Policy as our practices change to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.</p>
<h3>How does Dex Media use, store and share information collected on This Website?</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific Purpose</span>. When users supply personally identifiable information about themselves for a specific purpose (for example, to register to use a feature on This Website, to purchase a product or service, to obtain a free listing, to register for a program or to use a feature of a program, to receive information, or to apply for a job), we may use, store, and/or share such information for such purpose.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Similar to Information Collected in Traditional Non-Electronic Manner</span>. We also may use, store and/or share personally identifiable information users provide as we would use, store and/or share the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner. For example, we may use such personally identifiable information to assess your credit rating. We may also use store and/or share this information to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a non-published number), to contact you in connection with a program you are participating in, user reviews and/or to evaluate your service needs, and to contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. When users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a feature on This Website, we may also use, store and/or share such personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of such feature. (For example, if you register to use the personalized directory service, we may use the personally identifiable information you provide to provide you with a more personalized and useful service, and if you create a review of a business on This Website, we may publish your initials, city and state in connection with such review.) When users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion that we may run on This Website, we may use, store and/or share such information to administer such contest, sweepstakes or promotion and to notify winners.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Communicate with You</span>. We may also use, store and/or share personally identifiable information you provide or that is automatically collected to communicate with you (e.g., to send you e-mails) and to otherwise serve you. For example, we may use your name and e-mail address to send you e-mails to (a) provide information regarding our company, marketing information about our products and services or the products and services of other companies, and newsletters, (b) conduct online surveys, (c) confirm your registration on This Website, a service registration, or orders placed online and (d) otherwise communicate with you. However, you may request not to receive (i.e., “opt-out” of receiving) commercial e-mail messages (the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service) from us (on a category-by-category basis), by clicking on <a href="http://account.dexmedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp" target="_blank">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page. If you have previously opted out of receiving commercial e-mail messages related to one or more categories, you may cancel your request to opt-out of (i.e., consent to receive commercial e-mail messages from us related to) such categories (on a category-by-category basis) by clicking on <a href="http://account.dexmedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp" target="_blank">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page. Please note that we reserve the right to send certain types of e-mail messages that are not subject to opt-out (see information about <a href="#email">e-mails</a>, below) to online users, including those who have opted out of receiving commercial e-mail messages. Your personally identifiable information may also be used, stored and/or shared by non-“Dex Media Family” companies, with which we have agreements, to provide you information about their products and services.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Protect Dex Media’s Property or Other Rights</span>. In addition, Dex Media may use, store and/or share personally identifiable information you provide and information Dex Media automatically collects through This Website (and may combine personally identifiable information you provide with information Dex Media automatically collects through This Website and non-personally identifiable information you knowingly provide) as it deems appropriate to protect its property or other rights (for example, to enforce any policies or contractual provisions regarding use of the “ratings and reviews” feature or the “send a listing” feature).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Improve Website and Targeted Advertising</span>. We use, store and/or share information Dex Media automatically collects through This Website to improve This Website, to monitor its performance, to make This Website easier for you and other users to use, to manage features and programs made available through This Website and to provide behavioral tracking data to non-“Dex Media Family” companies, with which we have agreements, for the purpose of presenting you with, among other things, targeted advertising on third party websites. For example, Dex Media may use information Dex Media automatically collects in the ways described in the section entitled <a href="#Cookies">“What is a cookie and why does Dex Media use them?”</a>, below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mobile Advertising.</span> We use information Dex Media automatically collects through the Mobile Products to improve our mobile products, to monitor its performance, to make Mobile Products easier for you and other users to use, to manage features and programs made available through Mobile Products.</p>
<h3>Can I review and request changes to personally identifiable information that I provide through registration forms on This Website?</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Create and Update Profile</span>. If you use an available capability on This Website to register with us and create a profile, at any time after you register and create a profile, you may review and request changes to any personally identifiable information you provided through the registration form, by viewing and updating your profile within the application. If you use an available capability on Mobile Products to register with us, you may review and request changes to any personally identifiable information you provided through my.superpages.com.<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opt-Out of Receiving Commercial E-Mail Messages</span>. In addition, (i) you may request not to receive (i.e., “opt-out” of receiving) commercial e-mail messages from us (on a category-by category basis), by clicking on <a href="http://account.dexmedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp" target="_blank">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page, and (ii) if you have previously opted out of receiving commercial e-mail messages related to one or more categories, you may cancel your request to opt-out of (i.e., consent to receive commercial e-mail messages from us related to) such categories (on a category-by-category basis) by clicking on <a href="http://account.dexmedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp" target="_blank">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page. Please note that we reserve the right to send certain types of e-mail messages that are not subject to opt-out (see information about <a href="#email">e-mails</a>, below) to online users, including those who have opted out of receiving commercial e-mail messages.</p>
<h3>Do you sell or provide my information collected through This Website to companies outside of the “Dex Media Family?”</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Provided by You</span>. Except as otherwise disclosed in this policy, we do not sell personally identifiable information you provide to us through This Website to anyone outside of the “Dex Media Family” unless (i) you specifically authorize it, (ii) it is to complete a transaction, service or activity that you initiated or requested, (iii) it is to provide a service on behalf of Dex Media (for example, Dex Media may contract with an entity outside of the “Dex Media Family” to send e-mail messages on behalf of Dex Media), in which case such non- “Dex Media Family” entities are not permitted to use such information for any purpose other than to provide such service, (iv) it is to assess your credit ranking or report your failure to fulfill your payment obligations in connection with the purchase of (or application to purchase) products or services through This Website, (v) it is required by law or we believe that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, (vi) we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served, (vii) we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property, or (viii) Dex Media transfers all or substantially all of its assets to another entity (in which case Dex Media may disclose, sell and/or otherwise provide personally identifiable information to such entity). If you provide personally identifiable information to us in the context of an event Dex Media sponsors on This Website with another company, such as a contest, or if you register on a co-sponsored section or feature of This Website, you may also be providing such personally identifiable information to the co-sponsor. When you provide your personally identifiable information to any third party, Dex Media is not responsible for any third party’s use of such personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Automatically Collected</span>. As indicated above, Dex Media may share information it automatically collects through This Website with non-“Dex Media Family” companies. Dex Media may share this information in order to assess the results of a promotion, event or third party relationship, to provide information to current or prospective customers, to complete a transaction, service, search or other activity that the user initiated or requested, to non-“Dex Media Family” companies, with which we have agreements, to, among other things, facilitate targeted advertising on third party websites, or to otherwise enhance your online experience. For example, we may provide information Dex Media automatically collects:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>When you link to another site from This Website.</li>
<li>When you request certain information that Dex Media obtains from a third party.</li>
<li>When we host co-branded versions of This Website (or portions of This Website). Our co-branded websites may also contain clear .gif files (electronic images that allow This Website to automatically collect information about your visit to the website).</li>
</ul>
<p>When we use third party tracking services to help us analyze automatically collected information in the aggregate to evaluate the effectiveness of This Website, the third parties performing such tracking services are not permitted to use the information for any other purpose.<br>
Finally, we may also disclose information Dex Media automatically collects to non-“Dex Media Family” companies or entities if (a) it is required by law or we believe that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, (b) we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served, (c) we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property, or (d) Dex Media transfers all or substantially all of its assets to another entity (in which case Dex Media may disclose, sell and/or otherwise provide information Dex Media automatically collects to such entity).</p>
<p>Please note that Dex Media may support features and content appearing on other companies’ sites that you may visit. These companies may collect information about you, but Dex Media does not have control over the privacy practices of these companies. If you are visiting a site that indicates that it is “powered by superpages.com”, or if you <a href="#doyouaccommodate">link to another site</a> from This Website, you are advised to read the privacy policy of that site for its policies regarding information collection and usage.</p>
<h3>Do you sell my information collected through Mobile Products to companies outside of the “Dex Media Family?”</h3>
<p>Except as otherwise disclosed in this policy, we do not sell or disclose personally identifiable information you provide to us through our Mobile Website to anyone outside of the “Dex Media Family” unless (i) you specifically authorize it, (ii) it is to complete a transaction, service or activity that you initiated or requested, (iii) it is to provide a service on behalf of Dex Media, in which case such non- “Dex Media Family” entities are not permitted to use such information for any purpose other than to provide such service, (iv) it is required by law or we believe that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, (v) we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served, (vi) we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property, or (vii) Dex Media transfers all or substantially all of its assets to another entity (in which case Dex Media may disclose, sell and/or otherwise provide personally identifiable information to such entity).</p>
<h3>How long do you retain my information collected through This Website?</h3>
<p>Information that you provide to us on This Website will be retained in accordance with Dex Media’s Records Management and Retention Policy and applicable laws.</p>
<h3><a name="doyouaccommodate"></a>Do you accommodate links to other sites?</h3>
<p>Yes. This Website contains links to other sites. These other sites may, among other things, allow you to bid on and/or purchase products that you initially viewed on This Website. These other sites may (or may not) be “co-branded” or “private-labeled” with (or otherwise contain) the Dex Media® name and logo, Superpages®, Superpages.com®, Localsearch.comSM, SuperGuarantee®, SuperpagesDirect®, SuperpagesMobile®, DirectoryStore®, SuperYellowPages.com®, SuperTradeExchange®, Dex®, Dex One®, Dex Media™, DexKnows®, DexKnows.com®, How Findable Are You?™ trademarks or other trademarks or branding of Dex Media. <strong>You can tell if you have linked from one site to another site by looking at the URL in the browser window (or, if the link opens a new browser window, by looking at the URL found by “right-clicking” on the page in the window and selecting “properties”). If the second level domain of the URL for the page containing the link is different than the second level domain of the URL for the page to which you have linked, you have linked to a different site. For example, if you link from a page located at the URL www.thirdleveldomain.superpages.com to a page located at the URL www.superpages.secondleveldomain.com, you have linked to another website. Please note that any of Dex Media’s trademarks or service marks (e.g., Superpages®, Superpages.com®, Localsearch.comSM, SuperGuarantee®,</strong> Superpages®, Superpages.com®, Localsearch.comSM, SuperGuarantee®, SuperpagesDirect®, SuperpagesMobile®, DirectoryStore®, SuperYellowPages.com®, SuperTradeExchange®, Dex®, Dex One®, Dex Media™, DexKnows®, DexKnows.com®, How Findable Are You?™<strong>) may be included in the URL of a co-branded or private label site that is owned and operated by another company, in a location other than that occupied by the second level domain (e.g., as the third level domain).</strong> Other companies that own or operate these sites may track and/or collect information about you, but Dex Media does not have control over the privacy practices (including, without limitation, those relating to tracking user activity, collection of user data, use of user data, and security) of these companies(although, when a user activates a link from This Website to one of these other sites, Dex Media may pass the user’s referral URL and IP address to the server hosting such other site).

<h3>What security measures are in place to restrict access to personally identifiable information?</h3>
<p>Dex Media is committed to protecting your personally identifiable information that you provide through This Website. This Website is protected with a variety of security measures such as change control procedures and physical access controls (and passwords, as applicable). We also implement other control mechanisms in an effort to help protect personally identifiable information that you provide through This Website from being lost, misused or altered inappropriately.<br>

<h2><a name="Cookies"></a>Cookies</h2>
<h3>What is a cookie and why does Dex Media use them?</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small data string our server writes to your device’s internal drive that contains your unique User ID for This Website. Cookies help us to identify new and returning users to This Website, analyze click-stream data, and track historical activity on This Website, which allows us to give you a more personalized, useful experience on This Website. Cookies may be placed by us, by a third-party that provides services to us, or a non-“Dex Media Family” company, with which we have an agreement.</p>
<p>Cookies help Dex Media to enhance the user’s online, mobile experience and can be used to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>deliver the appropriate geographic message</li>
<li>manage frequency of ad exposure; avoid over delivery of the same message</li>
<li>tailor an advertisement or other content to better match your interests and preferences</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>ensure that you see the correct products and pricing applicable to the state in which you live</li>
<li>keep track of your order as you order services</li>
<li>understand advertising effectiveness</li>
<li>manage features and programs made available through This Website</li>
<li>collect anonymous traffic data</li>
</ul>
<p>A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your device or computer. However, customers are free to delete website cookies. Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your device or computer, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.</p>
<p>You can choose to change your browser settings to disable cookies if you do not want us to establish and maintain a unique User ID. Please be aware that cookies may be required to complete certain functions on This Website, such as ordering products or services, and, also in connection with personalized sections of This website, for example My Superpages. To disable cookies, follow your browsers instructions. To opt-out of the placement of behavioral tracking cookies, see “How to Opt-out of Behavior Tracking Cookies” below.</p>
<p>However, you need to understand that some websites/ad serving companies have the ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion, if you reenter the same site on another occasion, or some other site tracked by the ad serving company/network, and specifically provide personal data.</p>
<p>Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent ad serving companies from reestablishing history on a user. The user must either continue to decline cookies each time it reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or opt-out. When you opt-out, your unique user ID cookie is erased and you are reassigned an anonymous, non-id cookie. This new cookie tells websites that you have opted out and they will then know not to attempt to assign other cookies to you in the future. Opt-out cookies do not contain a unique user ID number therefore websites are not able to identify your computer uniquely.</p>
<p>Users who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have their browser advise them each time a website attempts to send a cookie to your system. At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel a cookie. Users who choose to “opt out” after deleting cookies will receive an anonymous/non personally identifiable cookie.</p>
