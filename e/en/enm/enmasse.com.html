The particular kinds of personal and non-personal information we collect usually depend on how you interact with us. The controller of the personal information collected is En Masse Entertainment, Inc., 1218 3rd Ave. Suite 800, Seattle, WA. 98101, USA.</p>

We may store and access it, and it may be read, copied, collected or used by other users without your consent. Please make sure your privacy settings reflect your preferences.</p>

          <p>When you participate in online multi-play games, your in-game profile information, gameplay, and statistics are visible to all. We may record your gameplay, including your controller button inputs, and replay these together with your profile information and game statistics to other players in-game without further notice to you, for example as part of a spectator mode, or for out-of-game promotional purposes.</p>

          <h3 id="how-we-collect">2. How We Collect Information</h3>

          <p>We collect information from you when you provide it to us directly, such as via an online form on our website or when you summit your support ticket to our CS team through https://support.enmasse.com. And also we and third parties use certain technologies described below to collect information to deliver excellent experiences.</p>

          <h4>A. Cookies and Other Similar Tracking Technologies</h4>
          <p>Cookies are small text pieces of data that online services you use place on your device for record-keeping purposes and stored on your Internet browser. We use cookies and similar technologies to help us understand things like what web pages, features or ads you view and what games you play. This information helps us keep track of your purchased records, measure the effectiveness of our advertising, make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly and otherwise help enhance your user experience. You can disable cookies, limit the types of cookies you allow, or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please refer to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a> or the guidance provided by your individual web browser if you'd like help in managing your cookie preferences.</p>

          <p>We use other technologies for similar purposes as a cookie. We use Internet log files (which contain technical data such as your IP address) to monitor traffic on our services, troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent fraud and enforce our User Agreement.</p>

          <h4>B. Analytics Technologies</h4>
          <p>We use our own game servers and internal and third party analytic technologies to collect information about how you use our services, your device and the health of our services.</p>

          <p>For instance, En Masse may collect and store data from your device when you use our services. This information includes technical and related information about your device info (such as operating system information and IP Address), information about your feature usage, gameplay and usage statistics. If you participate in online services, En Masse also may collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display statistical data regarding game play (including scores, rankings and accomplishments), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.</p>

          <h4>C. Advertisement Serving Technologies</h4>
          <p>Some of our services employ advertisement serving technologies that use cookies and other similar technologies like identifiers to deliver offers to you. The ads can be tailored to your interests. For instance, you may be presented with an offer for a game we think you might enjoy. Or if you express interest in a game, you might be offered an advertisement later for that game or similar services on En Masse or 3rd party’s web sites.</p>

          <p>The 3rd parties’ services via their web sites collect and use information under their own privacy policies.</p>

          <p>These technologies of the 3rd parties collect and use information so we can serve appropriate advertising to you and help track results and measure effectiveness. In addition to identifiers, this information includes:</p>

          <ul>
          <li>Advertisements served and the location of the ad;</li>
          <li>Domain type, IP address; and</li>
          <li>Advertisement response for target marketing.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The 3rd party companies may combine the information collected in the context of delivering an ad to you via our Services with other information they have independently collected across their websites. </p>

          <p>To learn more about some of these ad networks' practices, or to opt out of third party targeted advertising, you can visit <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank"> https://www.networkadvertising.org</a>, <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">https://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>, <a href="http://youradchoices.ca/" target="_blank">http://youradchoices.ca/</a>, or <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu" target="_blank">https://www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>. Note that opting out does not mean you won't see ads; it just means that the advertising you see may be less relevant to your interests.</p>

          <h4>D. Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies</h4>
          <p>En Masse strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment for all players.

          <p>We use other technologies for similar purposes as a cookie. We use Internet log files (which contain technical data such as your IP address) to monitor traffic on our services, troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent fraud and enforce our User Agreement.</p>

          <h4>B. Analytics Technologies</h4>
          <p>We use our own game servers and internal and third party analytic technologies to collect information about how you use our services, your device and the health of our services.</p>

          <p>For instance, En Masse may collect and store data from your device when you use our services. This information includes technical and related information about your device info (such as operating system information and IP Address), information about your feature usage, gameplay and usage statistics. If you participate in online services, En Masse also may collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display statistical data regarding game play (including scores, rankings and accomplishments), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.</p>

          <h4>C. Advertisement Serving Technologies</h4>
          <p>Some of our services employ advertisement serving technologies that use cookies and other similar technologies like identifiers to deliver offers to you. The ads can be tailored to your interests. For instance, you may be presented with an offer for a game we think you might enjoy. Or if you express interest in a game, you might be offered an advertisement later for that game or similar services on En Masse or 3rd party’s web sites.</p>

          <p>The 3rd parties’ services via their web sites collect and use information under their own privacy policies.</p>

          <p>These technologies of the 3rd parties collect and use information so we can serve appropriate advertising to you and help track results and measure effectiveness. In addition to identifiers, this information includes:</p>

          <ul>
          <li>Advertisements served and the location of the ad;</li>
          <li>Domain type, IP address; and</li>
          <li>Advertisement response for target marketing.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The 3rd party companies may combine the information collected in the context of delivering an ad to you via our Services with other information they have independently collected across their websites. </p>

          <p>To learn more about some of these ad networks' practices, or to opt out of third party targeted advertising, you can visit <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank"> https://www.networkadvertising.org</a>, <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">https://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>, <a href="http://youradchoices.ca/" target="_blank">http://youradchoices.ca/</a>, or <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu" target="_blank">https://www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>. Note that opting out does not mean you won't see ads; it just means that the advertising you see may be less relevant to your interests.</p>

          <h4>D. Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies</h4>
          <p>En Masse strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment for all players. When you log in to one of our services, set up an En Masse Account or make purchases, we or third parties may use cookies and similar technologies, or collect data about your machine or device, to create a machine "fingerprint" or "hash" of your machine components, for fraud prevention, security and authentication purposes.

          <h3 id="info-we-share">4. Information We Share with Third Parties</h3>

          <p>We do not share personal information in principle that directly identifies you (such as your name, e-mail or postal address) with independent third parties without your consent, unless it is either required by law or we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our rights, property or operations or to protect our players or third parties. We may share anonymous or other data that does not directly identify you, with third parties, for instance to show trends about use of our services.</p>

          <p>We might employ third parties located in and outside of your country of residence (including outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)) to collect or process personal information on our behalf for various reasons, such as maintaining our service, offering promotion/marketing or sending emails. When our third party agents or service providers collect or receive personal information, we require that they use the data only on our behalf and for purposes consistent with this policy.</p>

          <p>We do not knowingly disclose personal information about children under 18 years of age to independent third parties even with consent.</p>

          <p>However, in the event of a reorganization, divestiture, merger, sale or bankruptcy, we may transfer all information we collect to the relevant third party and will obtain your consent to do so if required by law.</p>

          <p>We do not control information sent from your browser to third parties, such as advertising networks and analytics companies that receive information in the normal course of your Internet activity. When third party technologies or social tools are integrated into our services, those third parties may collect information when you use our services. An example is the Facebook "Like" button.</p>

          <p>We remain responsible for the processing of personal information received under the Privacy Shield frameworks and subsequently transferred to a third party acting as an agent if the agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. We may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>

          <h3 id="how-we-store">5. Where We Hold Your Information</h3>

          <p>We maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. By using our services, you expressly agree that your personal and non-personal data may be processed and stored outside of the country you live and used for the purposes described in this policy.</p>

          <h3 id="how-we-protect">6. How We Protect Your Personal Information</h3>

          <p>Security of our players' information is a priority at En Masse, and we take a range of measures to help protect it, including pseudonymisation like encryption of sensitive information, and activities like prevention, monitoring and recovery of security incident for business continuity management. Even so, no security measure is perfect. This means we cannot guarantee the security of your information and do not assume any responsibility for the unauthorized use or access to your information under our control.</p>

          <h3 id="children">7. Children</h3>

We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online.</p>

          <h3 id="your-controls">8. Your Choices and Controls</h3>
