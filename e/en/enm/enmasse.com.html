<h3 id="info-we-collect">1. Information We Collect</h3>

And also we and third parties use certain technologies described below to collect information to deliver excellent experiences.</p>

<h4>A. Cookies and Other Similar Tracking Technologies</h4>

<p>The 3rd parties’ services via their web sites collect and use information under their own privacy policies.</p>

<li>Domain type, IP address; and</li>
<li>Advertisement response for target marketing.</li>
</ul>

<p>The 3rd party companies may combine the information collected in the context of delivering an ad to you via our Services with other information they have independently collected across their websites. </p>
