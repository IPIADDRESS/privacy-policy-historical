				<p align="left"><strong>We may use third-party advertising companies to

				<p align="left">These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also

				<p align="left"><strong>Certain exception disclosures</strong></p>
				<p align="left">We may disclose your information if necessary to protect our

				conduct, or envelopes.com has good faith belief that such action is 
				necessary to (1) conform to the requirements of law or comply with 
				governmental orders, court orders, or legal process served on 
				envelopes.com or (2) to protect and defend the property or rights of 
				envelopes.com, the users of its website or the public. This includes 
				exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud 
				protection and credit risk protection. If envelopes.com should ever file 
				for bankruptcy or merge with another company, we may sell the information 
				you provide to us on the envelopes.com website to a third party or share 
				your personal information with the company we merge with. </p>
				<p align="left"><strong>What are cookies? Why do we use them?</strong></p>
				<p align="left">Cookies are very tiny text files that are stored on your 
				computer when you visit certain web pages that record your preferences. 
				envelopes.com may use cookies to keep track of what you have in your 
				shopping cart and to remember you when you return to our site. They cannot 
				harm your computer and they do not contain any personal or private 
				information. You must accept cookies to order online at envelopes.com.</p>
				<p align="left"><strong>How do we protect information we collect?</strong></p>
				<p align="left">We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user 
				information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We 
				follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the 
				confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. 
				While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures 
				implemented by our web site reduce the likelihood of security problems to 
				a level appropriate to the type of data involved. envelopes.com's servers 
				use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption technology that works with 
				Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and AOL's browser, so 
				that only envelopes.com can read a customer's personal information. </p>
				<p align="left"><strong>How long do we keep user information?</strong></p>
				<p align="left">We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives 
				for as long as we reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according 
				to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed 
				to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the 
				law requires it. In addition, information posted in a public forum could 
				stay in the public domain indefinitely. </p>
				<p align="left">Data management requests are administered in an orderly 
				manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control. Note: we have 
				greater control over recently collected data than for archived data. Once 
				data is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to 
				accommodate specific requests. In those cases, our general data retention 
				policy applies. </p>
				<p align="left"><strong>Third party sites</strong></p>
				<p align="left">This Site contains links to third party websites. 
				envelopes.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content 
				of such websites. Your use of these third party websites is entirely at 
				your own risk. When you click on a link in an Offer Detail, you are 
				essentially taken to the originating Provider's site. Any log in or 
				purchase activities you perform there are done directly with the 
				individual Provider. </p>
				<p align="left"><strong>Your consent to this policy</strong></p>
				<p align="left">By using the envelopes.com web site, you agree to this 
				Privacy and Security Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy and 
				Security Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. Our Terms and 
				Conditions take precedence over any conflicting Policy provision. We may 
				change our Privacy and Security Policy by posting a new version of the 
				policy on this page. It is your responsibility to review frequently. </p>

				of any kind. We are not responsible for events beyond our direct control. 
				Florida law governs this Privacy and Security Policy, excluding conflicts
