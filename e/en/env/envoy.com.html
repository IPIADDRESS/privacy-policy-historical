Site without registering or submitting Personal Information. When you or a 
representative of your Subscriber register for our Site or any of our services, 
you or that representative provide information about you and/or your Subscriber. 
By providing us that information, you consent to our use of that information in 
accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you are enrolled as a member of a 
Subscriber, whoever completes the enrollment form or registration form (on paper

small computer files that we transfer to your computer's hard drive that allow 
us to know how often someone visits our Site and the activities they conduct 
while on our site (such as the chat rooms visited, etc.). Every computer is 
assigned a different cookie by WebMD. The information collected by cookies can 
help us dynamically generate advertising and content on web pages specifically 
designed for you and also allows us to statistically monitor how many people are 
using our site and for what purpose. Cookies also help us authenticate our 
users.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">Your browser software can be set to

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">Sponsors, partners, advertisers, or 
other third parties on WebMD may also use their own cookies when you click on 
their advertisement or link to their site or service. Some advertisers use 
companies other than WebMD to serve their ads and these companies ("Ad Servers") 
may also collect non-Personal Information through the use of cookies on our 
Site. We do not control these third parties' use of cookies, or how they manage 
the non-Personal Information they gather through them. However, we do require Ad 
Servers to agree that they will not collect any Personal Information from our 
Site without your consent and to agree they will not link any non-personal 
cookie information collected by them from our Site to Personal Information they 
or others collect in other ways or from other sites. You should review the

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">To register and pay for certain 
services on the Site offered by WebMD (in contrast to a service offered by a 
third party through the Site), e.g., a WebMD-sponsored CME course, you will be 
asked for credit card information and billing address. This information will be 
stored in a database on a secure server, and only authorized WebMD employees or 
contractors will have access to the database. However, WebMD will disclose your 
credit card and billing information to the financial institutions that process 
your charges; we may also disclose such information to third parties that 
provide credit card verification services to us. In accordance with this Privacy 
Policy, you may contact us to delete credit card information from our systems. 
We will honor your request, provided that we determine that you do not have an 
outstanding balance on your account.</font></p>

companies with which WebMD has joint marketing arrangements, such as practice 
management companies, for the purpose of contacting you to offer additional

<font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">Disclosure to WebMD Operations and 
Maintenance Contractors</font></u></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">WebMD operations and maintenance 
contractors sometimes have limited access to your Personal Information in the 
course of providing products or services to WebMD. These contractors include 
vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, and/or content 
related to better operation and maintenance of our Site and/or that send emails 
or letters to you on our behalf or who conducting market research on our behalf. 
Access to your Personal Information by these contractors is limited to the 
information reasonably necessary in order for the contractor to perform its 
limited function for WebMD. We also contractually require that our operations 
and maintenance contractors 1) protect the privacy of your Personal Information 
consistent with this Privacy Policy, and 2) not use or disclose your Personal 
Information for any purpose other than providing us with products and services.</font></p>

<font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">Disclosure to Transaction Partners</font></u></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">WebMDsSubscription Services may allow 
you to perform certain transactions with health care companies such as labs, 
payers, PBMs, pharmacies, and hospitals with which you may be affiliated 
("Transaction Partners"). WebMD may disclose your Registration Information and 
information about your use of Subscription Services to the Transaction Partners 
with which you engage in transactions (and/or their contractors).</font></p>
<p><a name="Anchor-Disclosure-39957"></a><u>
<font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">Disclosure to Co-Sponsors of Services</font></u></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">If we jointly sponsor a service on our 
Site with another party, we will share your Personal Information with our 
co-sponsor to the extent necessary for them to process and provide the service. 
For instance, WebMD offers Just In Time CME courses in conjunction with various 
accrediting agencies. If you register for such a course, we will share your 
Registration Information, but not your credit card information (if any), with 
those accrediting agencies to enable CME credit tracking.</font></p>
<p><a name="Anchor-Disclosure-25053"></a><u>
<font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">Disclosure in the Context of Linked Web 
Sites</font></u></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">WebMD will not disclose your Personal 
Information to the owners and operators of web sites linked to our Site, except 
to:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica"><u>Your Affiliated Organizations</u>: 
  The Site may contain co-brands and links to content and services offered by a 
  practice management system, payer, hospital or other organization with which 
  you or your Subscriber is affiliated (e.g., Medical Manager, Medic, Humana). 
  If you have access to the co-branded site and/or such content and services, we 
  may share your Personal Information with your affiliated organizations. For 
  instance, to enable single sign-on from our Site, we may pass your 
  Registration Information onto your affiliated organization when you click on a 
  link to their service.</font> </li>
  <li><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica"><u>Web Site Content and Service 
  Providers</u>: We allow third parties to offer content and services through 
  the Site by placing links on our Site to their web sites. One example of this 
  is the Cleveland Clinical Internal Medical Review Course, which is hosted and 
  served by Healthstream. Similarly, if you purchase an item through one of 
  WebMDs co-branded stores (e.g., from WebMD Supply Shop), you will be 
  purchasing it from a third party (e.g., medibuy.com). We will not share your 
  Personal Information with these third party content and service providers 
  without your consent, and we will make an effort to make it obvious to you 
  when you leave our Site and enter another web site, either by requiring you to 
  click on a link or by notifying you on the Site.</font> </li>
</ul>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">Please remember that this Privacy 
Policy no longer applies once you leave our Site and enter a linked third party 
web site.</font></p>

<font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">Disclosure to Other Third Parties</font></u></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">WebMD may provide your Personal 
Information to certain third parties with whom we have agreements, including 
Synergy, Inc., HealthPages and GeoAccess. WebMD also may provide limited 
Personal Information concerning your utilization of WebMD Subscription Services 
to third parties, including payers or pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs"). For 
example, WebMD may report formulary events to PBMs that monitor formulary 
compliance. In some cases, WebMD may receive compensation for providing this 
information.</font></p>
<p><a name="Anchor-Disclosure-18149"></a><u>
<font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">Disclosure of Aggregate Information</font></u></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">WebMD may provide to third parties 
non-Personal Information about you that does not allow you to be identified or 
contacted and that is combined with the non-Personal Information of other users 
("Aggregate Information"). For example, we might inform third parties regarding 
the number of users of our Site and the activities they conduct while on our 
Site. We might also inform a pharmaceutical company (that may or may not be an 
advertiser on our Site) that "30% of our users live east of the Mississippi" or 
that "15% of our users are board certified in Internal Medicine." Depending on 
the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this Aggregate 
Information. We also may not limit the third parties use of the Aggregate 
Information, except that we do require third parties to whom we disclose 
Aggregate Information to agree that they will not attempt to make this 
information personally identifiable by combining it with other databases or 
otherwise.</font></p>

<p><b><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">How WebMD Handles Privacy and 
Security Internally</font></b></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">WebMD wants your Personal Information 
to remain as secure as possible. That is why we have a two-tier security system 
that combines leading technical safeguards and a code of conduct for those 
employees that are permitted to access our customers' Personal Information. On 
the technical side, WebMD uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology 
in transmitting your Personal Information to our servers to help ensure the 
integrity and privacy of the Personal Information you provide to us via the 
Internet. Encryption involves systematically scrambling numbers and letters, so 
that even if someone managed to intercept the information, they would not be 
able to make sense of it. In order to take advantage of this encryption 
technology, you need to have an Internet browser that will support 128-bit 
encryption, such as Netscape or Microsoft Explorer. As an additional security 
measure, your password is encrypted when it is stored on our server. On the 
employee side, only a limited number of WebMD employees are authorized to access 
your Personal Information. All WebMD employees must abide by our Privacy Policy 
and those who violate our Privacy Policy are subject to disciplinary action, up 
to and including termination. Although we will make every reasonable effort to 
protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, or alteration by third 
parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in 
transmitting information over the Internet. There is also some risk that thieves 
could find a way to thwart our security systems.</font></p>

<p><b><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">Your Privacy Choices</font></b></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">At Registration and at various times 
as you use the Site, you may have the option of receiving 
informational/promotional emails or newsletters from WebMD and/or third parties, 
participating in research or marketing surveys and participating in other 
activities. You may exercise these options by placing or leaving in place a 
check mark beside a statement that expresses a preference for receiving these 
communications or participating in these activities. You may change your 
decision at any time by changing your preferences within your Profile or by 
following other directions provided in association with the individual 
communication or activity.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">Also, when you have received a

(1) delete your Personal Information from our systems if you terminate your 
membership in WebMD, (2) update the Personal Information that you have provided 
to us, and (3) change your preferences with respect to marketing contacts or 
other activities, by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@webmd.net">

information that WebMD maintains. You may not delete your Personal Information

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">It is not technologically possible to 
remove each and every record of the information you have provided to WebMD from 
our servers, even if you terminate your WebMD membership. The need to back-up 
our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of 
your Personal Information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be 
difficult or impossible for us to locate. Nevertheless, we promise that upon 
receiving your request, all Personal Information stored in the databases we 
actively use for research and daily business activities, and other readily 
searchable media, will be deleted.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">Privacy as it applies to the Internet 
is a dynamic, rapidly developing area. In the future, we may make significant 
changes to our privacy policy affecting the use of the Personal Information we 
collect. We will notify you by email of any significant changes and obtain your 
"opt-in" consent to any significant new uses of your Personal Information, if it 
was collected from you prior to a significant change in this policy. We may also 
make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that generally will not 
affect our use of your Personal Information. You should also check this posted 
Privacy Policy for any future changes. If you do not agree to the terms of this 
Privacy Policy or any revised policy, please exit the site immediately and 
terminate your membership in WebMD.</font></p>
