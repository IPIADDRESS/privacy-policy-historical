<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>
Enhance Interactive respects your privacy. Our purpose in collecting information 
from you is to help us provide you with better service, such as notifications about 
special offers and promotions. We will not willfully disclose any individually 
identifiable information about you to any third party without first receiving your 
permission, as explained in this privacy statement. Furthermore, we do not 
specifically target children under the age of 13, nor do we knowingly collect, without 
parental consent, individually identifiable information from such children. 
</p>

<h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
<p>
We may request that an entity applying for an account with Enhance Interactive 
provide us with certain personal information (such as its name, email address, etc.) 
relevant to our provision of the various services offered on our site. We do not collect 
any personal information other than that which is specifically and knowingly provided 
to us. When we request information, we explain how it may be used and give you an 
opportunity to request that the information not be used for those purposes. We also 
give you an opportunity to opt out of future communications from us. 
</p>

<h3>Cookies?</h3>
<p>
Like most sites, for account management purposes, Enhance Interactive uses 
cookies. Cookies are data files stored on your computer that identify you as a unique 
user. Cookies enable us to track user trends, preferences and patterns to better 
understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Most browsers 
permit users to refuse cookies or to be notified before a cookie is accepted. You can 
visit our site without using cookies. 
</p>

<h3>
Links to Other Sites?</h3>
<p>
The Enhance Interactive website contains links to other sites. Those sites may send 
their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. We are not 
responsible or liable for the privacy practices or content of such sites since we do not 
control them. 
</p>

<h3>With Whom Do We Share Information??</h3>
<p>
Enhance Interactive may share non-personal and non-personally identifiable 
information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other 
third parties. However, we only divulge aggregate information, such as how often the 
average user visits our website. Enhance Interactive may partner with other parties 
in connection with the various services offered on our site, such as credit card 
processors or email delivery services. In such instances, we may share limited 
personal information that is necessary for the third-party to provide its services. 
These companies are prohibited from using this information for any other purpose. 
</p>

<p>
Enhance Interactive may also provide personal information when disclosure may be 
required by law (e.g., subpoenas, search warrants and court orders). We may also 
determine that such action is reasonably necessary to protect a party's rights, 
property, or well-being. This action may include exchanging information with other 
companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud detection or protection, or in 
other situations involving suspicious or illegal activities. 
</p>

<h3>Business Transfers?</h3>
<p>
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Enhance Interactive, such as acquisition by 
or merger with another company, a user's personal information will, in most 
instances, be part of the assets transferred. 
</p>

<h3>Consent and Changes to this Privacy Statement?</h3>
<p>
By using our site or services, you consent to the collection and use of your 
information as we have outlined in this privacy statement and consent to our Terms 
of Use. Additionally, if you are using any of our services, we may also collect and 
use information in accordance with such service's applicable Terms and Conditions. 
Enhance Interactive may decide to change this privacy statement from time to time. 
If and when we do, we will post the changes on this page so that you are always 
aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances 
we disclose it. 
</p>

<h3>Who Can I Ask If I Have Additional Questions??</h3>
<p>
Feel free to contact us at any time with any questions you may have regarding our 
privacy statement. Our email address is info@enhanceinteractive.com.
</p>
<p> 
Effective September 14th, 2006.
