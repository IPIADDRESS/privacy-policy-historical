          personally identifiable.&nbsp; If you purchase a product or service
          via this website (and thereby become covered by the Act), the purchase

          right to view or receive any information about our database.&nbsp; In
          the event that the website, under advice of counsel agrees to divulge
          information, the requesting party must submit whatever information is
          demanded by the website in order to insure that the website is
          releasing information to the correct party.&nbsp; Other provisions of
          the OPPA may exempt this website from complying.&nbsp; While we take
          measures to ensure that outside parties do not have access to any
          information we have about you, we do not warranty that outside parties
          will not breach our system and thus have access to your information.&nbsp;
