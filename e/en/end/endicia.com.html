<p>This Privacy Policy of PSI Systems, Inc. d/b/a Endicia ("Endicia") describes in greater detail the privacy practices of Endicia and its corporate affiliates, meaning companies related by common ownership or control (“us,” “we,” “our”) responsible for collecting and maintaining certain information collected about you.</p>
<p>If you have questions or complaints regarding our Privacy  Policy or practices, please contact us as detailed under the&nbsp;How to  Contact Us&nbsp;heading below.</p>
<ol class="number">
    <li>
      <p><strong>WHEN THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES.&nbsp; If a Service you're  using links to this Privacy Policy, this Policy applies to you.</strong></p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) applies to our sites,  products, and services (collectively, "Services") that link to this  Policy. Endicia is the controller of all Personal Information subject to this  Policy for our Services.</p></li>
    <li>
		<p><strong>WHAT  WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION. We want to be clear about what information we  collect and how we use it to deliver our Services to you, operate our business,  and help make our Services useful, and work better for you. We do not sell or  share your Personal Information with third parties for their own commercial  uses, if you have opted out of such sharing.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>a) Types of Information We Collect.</strong> In connection with accessing our Services, we may collect information from you which can be used to identify you ("Personal Information"), such as your name, shipping/billing address, email address, phone, username and password.</p>
		<p>We collect information when you register or open an account, sign in, pay a bill, purchase a Service, call us for support, or give us feedback.  We may also get information from other companies or third parties, such as when you sync a third party account or service with your Endicia Account, or when we may use service providers to supplement the Personal Information you give us (e.g., validate your mailing address) to help us maintain the accuracy of your data and provide you with better service. Finally, we may collect content or other information that you may provide or create when you interact with our Services.</p>
		<p>We may also automatically collect certain usage information when you access our Services ("Usage Data"), such as Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, log files, unique device identifiers, pages viewed, browser type, any links you click on to leave or interact with our Services, and other usage information collected from cookies and other tracking technologies. For example, we collect IP addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information, such as using IP addresses to monitor the regions from which users navigate to our Services.  We may also collect IP addresses from users when they log into the Services as part of our log-in and security features.  We may also, when you enable location-based Services, collect Global Positioning System (GPS) location data and/or motion data.</p>
		<p>Our Services may change over time and we may introduce new features that may collect new or different types of information.</p>
		<p><strong>b) How We Use Your Information.</strong> We may use your information, including your Personal Information, for the following purposes: </p>
		<p><em>Account Registration.</em> We may use your name, address, phone number, and email address to register your account for certain Services we provide and to communicate important information to you. We may obtain additional Personal Information about you, such as address change information, from commercially available sources, to keep our records current.  If you set up an administrator account that may be accessed by people other than you, please note that they may see and have the ability to change or delete your Personal Information.  Please be careful who you give administrator access to, as you are responsible for their actions.</p>
		<p><em>To Provide Our Services and Operate Our Business.</em> We may use your information to operate our business, including providing Services you requested, provide you with support related to our Services, and to help us protect our Services, including to combat fraud and protect your information.</p>

		<p><strong>c) How We Share Your Personal Information.</strong> From time to time, we may need to share your Personal Information with others.</p>
		<p><em>Third Party Service Providers.</em> We may share your information, including Personal Information and Usage Data, with third party service providers who perform various functions to enable us to provide our Services and help us operate our business, such as website design, sending email communications, fraud detection and prevention, customer care, or performing analytics. Our contracts with these third parties require them to maintain the confidentiality of the Personal Information we provide to them, only act on our behalf and under our instructions, and not use Personal Information for purposes other than the product or service they're providing to us or on our behalf.</p>
		<p><em>United States Postal Service (USPS).</em> Endicia is regulated by the USPS. As part of the regulatory relationship, Endicia collects certain information about you on behalf of the USPS. The USPS also may send us tracking data from their scans of your mail and packages in the mailstream.

Information collected on behalf of USPS is used for their regulatory oversight function and is not used for other purposes.</p>
   		<p>As part of Endicia providing services of the USPS, the USPS requires that you agree to the USPS Privacy Act Statement and to provide information about yourself that will be maintained in a Privacy Act System of Records by the Postal Service.  Privacy Act Statement: Your information will be used to facilitate the purchase of USPS postage and fulfill transactional reporting requirements for USPS postage systems. Collection is authorized by 39 U.S.C. 401, 403, and 404. Providing the information is voluntary, but if not provided, your transaction may not be processed.

		<p><em>Protection of Endicia and Others.</em> We may share account information, Personal Information and Usage Data when we believe it is appropriate to enforce or apply our products' Terms of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Endicia, our Services, our users, or others.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.  This does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing Personal Information of our customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.   </p>
		<p><em>Information Sharing Between Endicia Entities.</em> We share your information, including your Personal Information, with and among our subsidiaries, except where prohibited by law. Subsidiaries means companies related by common ownership or control. The reasons why we share your information include for our everyday business purposes, such as to: process your transactions, maintain your accounts, operate our business, etc. We may also share your information in order for us to be able to offer our products and services to you. We may also share information about your transactions and experience so that we can operate our business effectively, detect and prevent fraud, and improve our Services.</p>

The information shared will not include your e-mail address; your phone number; any information related to your postage, mailing activity or postage meter license; or any information related to your customers or address lists.
