<p>Updated as of 10/28/2010</p>
<p>At Blink New Media, privacy is a top priority and we provide this Privacy Policy to outline our practices and procedures with respect to information collection and use to enable you to make an informed decision about sharing information with us. Blink New Media is an advertising network which means we may deliver advertisements to the websites you visit.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Acceptance of Terms</p>
<p>Please read this policy carefully since by visiting this website (“Website”) and/or sharing information with us, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy may be revised or updated at any time by us. This page was last updated as of the date at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>INFORMATION BLINK COLLECTS</p>
<p>Non-Peronal Indentifiable Information</p>
<p>As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience for all recipients of Blink New Media advertising, we may use log files, web beacons and cookies to collect data from browsers, advertiser and third party sites (“Sites”) to aggregate Information. The Information collected is used for marketing purposes, enables us to determine which advertisements perform well, allows us to more effectively match advertisements and website content to your interests, assists us in improving the operation of our services, helps us to maintain the quality of our services, enhances our services to our business partners and clients and enables us to provide general statistics to our business partners and clients regarding use of Blink New Media’s services. As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience for all recipients of Blink New Media advertising, we may use log files, web beacons and cookies to collect data from browsers, advertiser and third party sites (“Sites”) to aggregate Information. The Information collected is used for marketing purposes, enables us to determine which advertisements perform well, allows us to more effectively match advertisements and website content to your interests, assists us in improving the operation of our services, helps us to maintain the quality of our services, enhances our services to our business partners and clients and enables us to provide general statistics to our business partners and clients regarding use of Blink New Media’s services.</p>
<p>“Log files” track actions occurring on Sites and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, click data and types of advertisements viewed.</p>
<p>“Web beacons” are electronic files used to track your navigation of a website or collection of sites, the completion of transactions, submittal of applications and browsing behavior.</p>
<p>“Cookies” are files (e.g. HTTP cookies) that are stored on your Internet enabled device (which includes your computer, BlackBerry or other PDA). Cookies are used to improve the experience web users have when they see web advertisements and ensure that when a web user clicks on an advertisement, they are sent to the correct click-through destination. We may use Cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display. This allows advertisers to determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach. Cookies are also used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser, and to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement.</p>
<p>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p>We do not share any information.</p>
<p>OPTIONS</p>
<p>Blink New Media also offers an “opt-out Cookie” to block the placement of future Blink New Media Cookies on your system for 10 years from the time you opted out. If you have multiple internet browsers or users on the same computer, you will need to perform the opt-out operation for each browser and/or user. If you or your privacy software deletes the opt-out Cookie from your computer, you will need to repeat the process.</p>
<p>Install the Blink New Media Opt-Out Cookie</p>
<p>Please note that the above link for an opt-out Cookie is only applicable to Blink New Media and not any other Blink New company website. Also, please note that use of the opt-out Cookie will affect our ability to provide you content and advertisements that will more effectively match your interests and may prevent us from controlling the frequency with which you may view any particular advertisement. Please report any problems related to the opt-out process to privacy@bnmla.com.</p>
<p>PROCESSING AND STORING YOUR DATA</p>
<p>FOR EUROPEAN UNION CITIZENS</p>
<p>The European Union (“EU”) maintains strict privacy laws. These rules differ significantly from the laws of the United States of America (“US”). To reconcile these differences, the US and the EU have created a safe harbor (“Safe Harbor”) that defines mutually acceptable privacy operations. For more information see http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.</p>
<p>Blink New Media complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries. We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view the company’s certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.</p>
<p>In compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. In the first instance, European Union citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact: privacy@bnmla.com. Blink New Media has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU Safe Harbor, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. Thus, if you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Blink New Media you may contact:</p>
<p>Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. BBB EU Safe Harbor 4200 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 800 Arlington, VA 22203 Phone: 703-276-0100 Web: www.us.bbb.org Email: eusafeharbor@council.bbb.org</p>

<p>Blink New Media employs appropriate measures to ensure the security of all Information and We routinely evaluate our practices to identify security threats or opportunities for the improvement of our services. No transmission of information is guaranteed to be completely secure. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise data security. You acknowledge and agree to assume this risk when communicating with us.</p>
<p>CHANGES</p>
<p>As the standards governing Internet privacy continue to evolve, Blink New Media may find it appropriate or necessary to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. As a result, we reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time and shall post such changes on the Website. Our Website will state the date the Privacy Policy was last updated. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you use this Website to make sure you understand how your information will be used. If we materially change how we use your Information, we will notify via a prominent notice on the Website prior to implementing the change</p>
<p>RETENTION</p>
