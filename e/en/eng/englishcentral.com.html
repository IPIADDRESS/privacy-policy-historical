	<h1>ENGLISHCENTRAL PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy governs EnglishCentral.com's ("we", "us" or
		"<strong>EnglishCentral</strong>") treatment of personally identifiable information that
		EnglishCentral collects when you use the EnglishCentral.com website (the "<strong>Site</strong>"),
		when you share information about yourself on our Site as well as when you provide information to
		us in any medium. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to EnglishCentral's
		Terms of Use, which can be found at <a href="/static/terms">http://www.EnglishCentral.com/static/terms</a>. Each time
		that you use the Site and the services available to you on the Site ("Services"),
		you signify that you agree to be bound by the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.
		If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the Site
		and terminate your registration with us. The Site is owned by EnglishCentral, Inc.
	</p>
	<h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
	<p>
		<em>User Provided Information</em>.  EnglishCentral collects personal information from you when you register on the Site, update your profile, interact with other users, and use various features of the Site. To register with EnglishCentral, you must provide a user name, password, native language,  and email address. When you register you may also provide your country, gender, English ability and other information. Once you are a registered user of EnglishCentral you may be given the option to add additional personal information to your profile. We may also collect information regarding your interaction with other users and your use of the Site, including content you view linked from the Site and EnglishCentral points that you have earned, which will also be displayed on the Site. From time to time we may ask you to respond to surveys or other requests for information, and we collect the information you provide. We may collect information from you when you participate in sweepstakes and promotions offered on the Site. We use this information to continually offer you the most value as a user of the Site.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Tracking Technology</em>. EnglishCentral logs IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the Site. We may track your movement within the Site, the third-party website pages from which you were referred, your use of the media player, access times and browser types. We use this information to gauge the effectiveness of our Site, track information for statistical purposes and to improve the products and services we provide. We store information that we collect through cookies, log files and other tracking technology such as clear gifs. We use cookies on the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Persistent cookies are used to differentiate visitors of the Site from registered users, to customize the content of certain sections of the Site and to enable us to track and cater to the interests of users, in order to enhance their experience on the Site. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use some areas of the Site may be limited and you may not be able to use certain features of the Site.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Supplemental Information</em>. We may supplement the information you provide us by acquiring commercially available demographic and marketing information from third parties, for instance, to update your information and to create a profile of your preferences. We may tie your personally identifiable information to information in the profile, in order to improve the content of the Site for you or to inform you about products or services that we think will be of interest to you.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Advertisements</em>.   We may from time to time use various outside ad-serving companies and affiliates to serve advertisements on the Site. In the process of serving advertisements, the ad serving companies may place a cookie in your browser's cookie file and may use information about your visits to the Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements on the Site about products and services that may be of interest to you. By delivering ads on the Site, the ad-server is able to record what ads a user -- identified by the unique cookie -- has seen, and what pages the user was viewing when the ads were delivered. This web usage information is combined with other ad delivery information the ad-server has collected from your visits to the Site and other websites not affiliated with EnglishCentral. This non-personally identifiable information is used as part of the ad-serving process for reporting and to select and direct the ads you see online at the Site and other websites not affiliated with EnglishCentral.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Surveys or Promotions</em>. From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes, contests or other promotions promoted on the Site, which might be sponsored or conducted by EnglishCentral or by a third party. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these promotions is completely voluntary and you will have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information. If there is a third party sponsor involved please make sure to review that third party's privacy policy.
	</p>
	<h2>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
	<p>
		<em>When you Register</em>. When you register with EnglishCentral, you can create your own profile. If your profile is visible, your profile information, as well as your name and picture are displayed to other registered users as well as visitors to the Site.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Our Use</em>. We receive and store any personal information you enter on the Site or give to us voluntarily in any other way and may use it to contact you from time to time. This means we may contact you by email, phone and/or cell number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving (e.g. video etc.). We may also send you information or offers from time to time to a postal address or email address we have on file. If you provide your name for a promotional offer to enter a sweepstakes or contest, and win a prize, we will post a winner's list online, and will file your name with state agencies if required by law.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Vendors</em>. We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples might include sending email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links and providing customer service. They have access to your personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Third Party Offers</em>. We may share personally identifiable information with third parties in order to have them send you special offers and promotions or other information we think you might find of interest. We ourselves will also occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, promotions, or information which we have found that may be of interest to our users and subscribers. If you do not want us to use the information you provide in order to inform you of products and services we think might interest you, or provide your information to third party companies, it is your obligation to please let us know, by contacting us at customerservice@EnglishCentral.com.
	</p>
	<p>

Using the information you give us on these potential users, we will send them an email message including a link to the Site, and we may include an invitation to join EnglishCentral.

For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, or the delivery of a service or product is delayed we might send you an email, or other message, or if there is some service issue with something you might have ordered. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to cancel your registration on our Site by sending an email to us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@EnglishCentral.com">customerservice@EnglishCentral.com</a>.
