<h1>ENGLISHCENTRAL PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy governs EnglishCentral.com's ("EnglishCentral") treatment of personally identifiable information that EnglishCentral collects when you use the EnglishCentral.com webWebSite (the "WebSite"), when you share information about yourself on the WebSite as well as when you provide information to us in any medium. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to <a class="em" href="/en/static/terms">EnglishCentral's Terms of Use</a>. Each time that you use the WebSite and the services available to you on the WebSite ("Services"), you signify that you agree to be bound by the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the WebSite and terminate your registration with us. The WebSite is owned by BabelCentral, Inc. d/b/a EnglishCentral.com. All references to EnglishCentral or EnglishCentral.com will be deemed to include BabelCentral, Inc.</p> 
<h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2> 
<p><em>User Provided Information</em>. EnglishCentral collects personal information from you when you register on the WebSite, update your profile, and use various features of the WebSite. To register with EnglishCentral, you must provide a user name, password, native language, countryand email address and other information.. Once you are a registered user of EnglishCentral you will be given the option to add additional personal information about you to your profile. By enabling the invisible mode you can limit what information will be viewed by others. In invisible mode you will be able to send messages to other users, chat with other users, and view and post comments and messages, but other users will only be able to view your user name and country flag. They will not be able to view other information in your profile. However, while in invisible mode you cannot invite other users to join your circle of friends, and they cannot invite you to join theirs. You can enable or disable the invisible mode at any time. To do this, just click on the "My EnglishCentral" link listed throughout the WebSite and then click on "My Account" to select or unselect the preference for "invisible mode". However, enabling invisible mode will not affect information that had been previously posted. Any previously posted information may still be visible to other users. Also, disabling invisible mode will make information about your previous activity on the WebSite, even while you were in invisible mode, available to other users. Be aware that whether you are in invisible mode or not, if you choose to make public posts, submit a comment, or chat, then any personal information you actively include in such submissions, and certain basic profile data that cannot be hidden, such as your username and your country flag, will still be accessible to all registered users and any visitors to the WebSite. By posting a profile or disclosing personal information in our online forums, directly to users in chat rooms or through messages, or otherwise, your information is made public and you should not expect any privacy in such an environment. We may also collect information regarding your interaction with other users and your use of the WebSite, including content you view linked from the WebSite and EnglishCentral points that you have earned, which will also be displayed on the WebSite. From time to time we may ask you to respond to surveys or other requests for information, and we collect the information you provide. We may collect information from you when you participate in sweepstakes and promotions offered on the WebSite. We may also collect information about you through other methods, including research surveys or information we obtain from third parties, including verification services, data services, as well as public sources. We use this information to continually offer you the most value as a user of the WebSite.</p> 
<p><em>Tracking Technology</em>. EnglishCentral logs IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the WebSite. We may track your movement within the WebSite, the third-party webWebSite pages from which you were referred, your use of the media player, access times and browser types. We use this information to gauge the effectiveness of our WebSite, track information for statistical purposes and to improve the products and services we provide. We store information that we collect through cookies, log files and other tracking technology such as clear gifs. We use cookies on the WebSite. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our WebSite. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Persistent cookies are used to differentiate visitors of the WebSite from registered users, to customize the content of certain sections of the WebSite and to enable us to track and cater to the interests of users, in order to enhance their experience on the WebSite. If you reject cookies, you may still use the WebSite, but your ability to use some areas of the WebSite may be limited and you may not be able to use certain features of the WebSite.</p> 
<p><em>Supplemental Information</em>. We may supplement the information you provide us by acquiring commercially available demographic and marketing information from third parties, for instance, to update your information and to create a profile of your preferences. We may tie your personally identifiable information to information in the profile, in order to improve the content of the WebSite for you or to inform you about products or services that we think will be of interest to you.</p> 
<p><em>Third Party Links</em>. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by us on the WebSite and collected when you subscribe to or use the EnglishCentral Service or purchase products from us. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the WebSite and to read the privacy statements of other webWebSites you visit that collect personally identifiable information.</p> 
<p><em>Advertisements</em>. We may from time to time use various outside ad-serving companies and affiliates to serve advertisements on the WebSite. In the process of serving advertisements, the ad serving companies may place a cookie in your browser's cookie file and may use information about your visits to the WebSite and other webWebSites in order to provide advertisements on the WebSite about products and services that may be of interest to you. By delivering ads on the WebSite, the ad-server is able to record what ads a user -- identified by the unique cookie -- has seen, and what pages the user was viewing when the ads were delivered. This web usage information is combined with other ad delivery information the ad-server has collected from your visits to the WebSite and other webWebSites not affiliated with EnglishCentral. This non-personally identifiable information is used as part of the ad-serving process for reporting and to select and direct the ads you see online at the WebSite and other webWebSites not affiliated with EnglishCentral.</p> 
<p><em>Surveys or Promotions</em>. From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes, contests or other promotions promoted on the WebSite, which might be sponsored or conducted by EnglishCentral or by a third party. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these promotions is completely voluntary and you will have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information. If there is a third party sponsor involved please make sure to review that third party's privacy policy.</p> 
<h2>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2> 
<p><em>When you Register</em>. When you register with EnglishCentral, you can create your own profile. If your profile is visible, your profile information, as well as your screen name, activities, and picture are displayed to other registered users as well as visitors to the WebSite. Your real name is never displayed on the WebSite (unless you use it as your screen name). You can choose to allow others to search for you by using your profile name or most other information you have entered in your profile if you choose to make your profile visible.</p> 
<p>Please be aware that certain personal profile information is displayed for all users and cannot be hidden. Specifically, even if your profile is invisible, your screen name and country flag entered on your profile are always displayed on the WebSite and therefore, are viewable by all users if you post a comment or participate in chat or message boards. In addition, because this information is publicly displayed on the WebSite, it may appear in the results of searches conducted on Internet search engines while you are a registered user of the WebSite and potentially for some time period after your account is terminated, depending upon the search engine's indexing practices.</p> 
<p><em>User Content Posted Online</em>. As a registered user, you can share personal content, such as videos, journals and photos. Please be aware that by using any of these features, your personally identifiable information may be accessible to other users and visitors to the WebSite, and EnglishCentral has no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information. We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the public and private forums and interactive areas on our WebSite. Please review our Terms of Use for more information regarding your appropriate use of these areas.</p> 
<p><em>Our Use</em>. We receive and store any personal information you enter on the WebSite or give to us voluntarily in any other way and may use it to contact you from time to time. Specifically, by registering on the WebSite, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase, inquiry and/or application for purposes of telemarketing laws. Regardless of the fact that your telephone and/or cell number may be listed with the Federal Do-Not-Call Registry, or your local State Do-Not-Call list, you expressly consent to receive future information about products and services from us, and in, that regard, you hereby consent to our contacting you pursuant to the business relationship established using the information you provided to us. This means we may contact you by email, phone and/or cell number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving (e.g. video etc.). We may also send you information or offers from time to time to a postal address or email address we have on file. If you provide your name for a promotional offer to enter a sweepstakes or contest, and win a prize, we will post a winner's list online, and will file your name with state agencies if required by law.</p> 
<p><em>Vendors</em>. We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples might include sending email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links and providing customer service. They have access to your personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</p> 
<p><em>Third Party Offers</em>. We may share personally identifiable information with third parties in order to have them send you special offers and promotions or other information we think you might find of interest. We ourselves will also occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, promotions, or information which we have found that may be of interest to our users and subscribers.

<p><em>Invite a Friend</em>. If you do become a registered user, you can also share links to videos on the WebSite with other individuals by providing us with their email addresses. Using the information you give us on these potential users, we will send them an email message including a link to the WebSite, and we may include an invitation to join EnglishCentral.
