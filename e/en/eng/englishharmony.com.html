</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I&nbsp;have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate&nbsp;my firm and
continuing commitment to the privacy of personal information provided by those visiting and interacting with this web site.&nbsp;I hold the
privacy of your personal information in the highest regard. The following discloses&nbsp;my information gathering and dissemination practices for
this website.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I&nbsp;recognize the importance of protecting your privacy</span></b> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">and&nbsp;my policy is designed to assist you in understanding how&nbsp;I collect, use and safeguard the
personal information you provide to&nbsp;me and to assist you in making informed decisions when using&nbsp;my site. This policy will be
continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and my customers' needs.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What Information Do&nbsp;I Collect?</span></strong><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br></span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">When you visit this web site you may
provide&nbsp;me with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and
Web site use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse&nbsp;my Web site.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Registration Information</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><br></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">When you register for any of&nbsp;my
products, services or newsletters you will provide me information about yourself:<br>
-Name<br>
-Email address</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Email Information</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
If you choose to correspond with&nbsp;me through email,&nbsp;I may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address
and&nbsp;my responses. I&nbsp;provide the same protections for these electronic communications that&nbsp;I employ in the maintenance of
information received by mail and telephone.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
<strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">2. Web Site Use Information</span></strong><br>
Similar to other commercial Web sites, my Web site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?")
and web server log files to collect information about how&nbsp;my Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may
include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at&nbsp;my Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just
after&nbsp;my Web site.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">How Do I&nbsp;Use the Information That You Provide to Me?</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Broadly speaking,&nbsp;I use personal information for purposes of administering&nbsp;my
business activities, providing the products and services you requested, to monitor the use of the service,&nbsp;my marketing and promotional
efforts and improve&nbsp;my content and service offerings, and customize&nbsp;my site's content, layout, services and for other lawful purposes.
These uses improve&nbsp;my site and better tailor it to meet your needs.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Furthermore, such information may be shared with others on an aggregate basis. Personally
identifiable information or business information will not be shared with parties except as required by law.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Occasionally,&nbsp;I may also use the information I collect to notify you about important
changes to&nbsp;my Website, new services, and special offers I think you will find valuable. You may notify me at any time if you do not wish to
receive these offers by emailing me at the link provided on the newsletter.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break">
<br style="mso-special-character: line-break"></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What Are Cookies?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks
your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own
cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the
cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would
prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse
cookies, it is possible that some areas of my site will not function as effectively when viewed by the users. <b>A cookie cannot retrieve any
other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</b></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">How Do&nbsp;I Use Information&nbsp;I Collect from
Cookies?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
As you visit and browse my Web site, the site uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases,&nbsp;I also use cookies to
prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with my Web server's log files, allow&nbsp;me to
calculate the aggregate number of people visiting&nbsp;my Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps&nbsp;me gather
feedback to constantly improve&nbsp;my Web site and better serve&nbsp;my clients. Cookies do not allow&nbsp;me to gather any personal information
about you and&nbsp;I do not intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to&nbsp;me in your cookies.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">IP Addresses</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the
network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by&nbsp;my web server as part of demographic and profile data known
as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Sharing and Selling Information</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
I&nbsp;<b>do not</b> share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal
details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process transactions or provide services that you have requested.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that&nbsp;I collect online and maintain in my database by emailing&nbsp;me
at the usual address.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?<br></span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I&nbsp;may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when I, in good faith,
believe that the law requires it or for the protection of&nbsp;my legal rights.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What About Other Web Sites Linked to My Web Site?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
I'm not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from&nbsp;my Web site or the information or content contained therein.
Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of&nbsp;my Web
site.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Please remember that when you use a link to go from&nbsp;my Website to another web
site,&nbsp;my Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other web site, including web sites, which have a link
on&nbsp;my Website, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Your Consent</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
By using&nbsp;my Web site you consent to&nbsp;my collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.
I&nbsp;reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or without notice.</span></p>

<p><em><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">My&nbsp;Commitment To Data Security:</span></b></em></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of
information,&nbsp;I have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information&nbsp;I
collect online.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out<br></span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">This site allows visitors to unsubscribe so that they will not receive future messages. After
unsubscribing&nbsp;I will discontinue sending the particular messages as soon as technically feasible.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">A Special Note About Children</span></b></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Children are not eligible to use&nbsp;my services unsupervised and&nbsp;I ask that children
(under the age of 14) do not submit any personal information to me. If you are a minor, you can use this service only in conjunction with
permission and guidance from your parents or guardians.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Acquisition or Changes in Ownership</span></b></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">In the event that the web site (or a substantial portion of its assets) is acquired, your
information would be considered part of those assets, and may be part of those assets that are transferred.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Policy Modifications</span></b><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br></span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I&nbsp;may change this Privacy Policy from
time to time. If/when changes are made to this privacy policy,&nbsp;I will email users who have given me permission to do so.&nbsp;I will post
any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future,&nbsp;I will
not use the personal information you have submitted to me under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy
Policy, without your prior consent.</span></p>
