					<p>When visiting EnglishGrammar101.com, we want you to be assured that we would never compromise your personal privacy or share your personal information with anyone without first gaining your permission. We have created this statement so you will know why we gather data, how we gather data, and what we do with the collected data.
					</p><p>EnglishGrammar101.com is a free website and in order to attract and retain sponsors, we aggregate data and provide the results so potential sponsors will understand the value of EnglishGrammar101.com's visitors as a community of like interest.

					</p><p><b>Gathering of Information</b><br>
					We gather information in two ways; Voluntary Submission and "Cookies."
					</p><p><b>Voluntary Submission</b><br>
					When you submit an exercise, we ask you for your and your teacher's name and e-mail address. We use this information to identify you as a student and/or teacher while browsing the site, and to send you periodic e-mails notifying you of new features or other information relating to the site.  It is not our intent or purpose to gather this information for sale to a third party.
					</p><p><b>Cookies</b><br>
					A cookie is a small data file that certain web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information, such as a visitor ID, which the site uses to provide a more personalized browsing experience. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.
					</p><p><b>Uses of Information</b><br>
					We use any information you voluntarily give us to enhance your experience at our site, whether to provide you with interactive or personalized elements on the site or to better prepare future content based on your interests.
					</p><p>We aggregate this information to determine which areas of our site members like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We don't track what individual members read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better web site for you.
					</p><p>We also use the information that is gathered to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our sponsors better understand our visitor's demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free.<br>
