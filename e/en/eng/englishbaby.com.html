</tbody></table><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="2"><b>What 
information does English, baby! collect?</b></a><br> English, baby! wants to be 
your favorite online destination. To encourage your participation, your English, 
baby! experience is personalized so that you are offered the services, products 
and information most relevant to you. This requires the collection of information 
to help tell you apart from other English, baby! members. The forms are specially 
designed so that you don't have to disclose any more information than is necessary 
to participate in a given activity or use a given tool. <br><br> English, baby! 
collects two kinds of information: anonymous and personally identifiable. Anonymous 
information is not associated with specific individuals. For instance, English, 
baby! may know how many people read this Privacy Policy today, but they don't 
necessarily know their names, addresses or birthdays. Personally identifiable 
information reveals who you are and/or how you can be contacted. It includes your 
name, address, phone number and email address. <br><br> Below is a summary of 
the different ways English, baby! collects various kinds of information about 
members: <br><br> <b>Registration (mandatory to be an English, baby! member)</b><br> 
If you decide to join English, baby!, registration is the only place where you 
will be required to submit information about yourself. To become an English, baby! 
member, you need to complete a form with your email address (which can be your 
new English, baby! email address), gender, birthday, zip code, country (and other 
related information). English, baby! uses this information to provide you with 
more personalized service, and to learn more about its audience demographics. 
<br><br> Only when you choose to participate in optional English, baby! programs 
or services will registration information be linked to information you submit 
for other purposes. For example, if you decide to be an English, baby! Rep, you'll 
be asked to provide English, baby! with your full name, address, school and graduating 
class. English, baby! keeps this information in its database with your member 
name and other registration data. If you decide that you no longer want English, 
baby! to have a certain piece of information about you, email the <a href="mailto:privacy@englishbaby.com">Policy 
Manager</a>. <br><b>Your Member Profile (optional)</b><br> Information from registration 
will automatically be placed in your Member Profile. In addition, you can choose 
to tell everyone your hobbies, interests, likes and dislikes by creating a Member 
Gallery (or Alumni) Profile. You can fill out as much or as little of your Profile 
as you want. The more you fill out, the more likely it is that you'll be able 
to meet members based on things you have in common. <br><b>Wireless (optional)</b><br> 
In your account settings, you can register to receive English, baby! text messages 
on your cell phone or pager. To do this, you must submit your device's area code 
and number as well as the confirmation number English, baby! provides to you. 
The wireless information you submit is linked to your member name and stored in 
a database that only authorized English, baby! technical staff can access. For 
your protection, the tech staff has devised a system of verification to ensure 
that nobody but you can register your device. <br><b>Other places (optional)</b><br> 
English, baby! runs promotions, contests, submission opportunities, surveys and 
programs designed to improve your experience on English, baby!. To participate 
in these programs you may have to give contact (name, address, email address) 
and/or demographic (i.e., age, gender) information. This only goes to the authorized 
English, baby! employees who run the promotion, contest or program so that they 
can inform you if you win, ask you questions about your submission and deal with 
other relevant details. English, baby! understands your decision to participate 
as permission to contact you, if necessary, and to store this additional information 
in its databases with your registration data. <br> <b>Public forums (privacy warning)</b><br> 
English, baby! understands your decision to post in public areas as permission 
to contact you through your English, baby! account. <br><br> One last thing to 
keep in mind: Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on message 
boards, through email, English, baby! Member Galleries, Alumni Spotlights, Message 
Boards, or in chat, it can be collected and used by anyone, including law-enforcement 
agencies acting under subpoena power. If you post personal information in public 
places, others may send you unsolicited email messages. Always be smart about 
the information you provide online. And, be aware that if English, baby! employees 
find personally identifiable information posted in public areas, they will delete 
it. <br> <a href="#top"><font face="arial" size="1">back to top</font></a> <br><br> 
<a name="4"><b>What are cookies, and how does English, baby! use them?</b></a><br> 
English, baby! collects anonymous information through cookies. A cookie is a small 
piece of data containing a unique identification number that is sent to your browser 
from a web server, and is stored on your computer's hard drive. The unique ID 
number identifies your browser to English, baby!'s computers whenever you visit. 
Cookies do not enable anyone to access personally identifiable information that 
you have not already given us. English, baby! primarily uses cookies to connect 
members with account information stored on English, baby!'s computers. This helps 
English, baby! deliver better and more personalized service. English, baby! also 
uses cookies to estimate English, baby!'s audience size for advertisers; to track 
the number of entries in English, baby! promotions, sweepstakes and contests; 
to identify the areas of the site you visit; to hold session information; and 
to track user preferences. <br><br> Cookies are part of the technology implemented 
by your browser. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can 
reset your browser to either notify you when you have received a cookie, or to 
refuse them all together. To find out more about cookies on Netscape, <a href="http://home.netscape.com/privacy/index.html" target="_blank">click 
here</a>. For information about cookies on Microsoft Internet Explorer, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm" target="_blank">click 
here</a>. <br><br> English, baby! uses both permanent and temporary cookies. Permanent 
cookies stay with your browser, whereas temporary cookies go away after you close 
your browser. English, baby! uses permanent cookies in order to recognize you 
between visits. English, baby! uses temporary cookies to store information about 
your current visit to the site. That information goes away when you close your 
browser or shut down your computer. If you choose to not accept cookies, you cannot 
participate as a registered, signed-in member. <br> <a href="#top"><font face="arial" size="1">back 
to top</font></a> <br><br> <a name="5"><b>How does English, baby! use member information?</b></a><br> 
English, baby!'s decisions regarding the use of information collected from English, 
baby! members are based on two areas of interest: market research, and improving 
user experience by offering personalized service and content. <br><br> English, 
baby! may analyze information provided directly by you, or obtained through cookies 
or third parties to direct services and content based on your interests. This 
is done in the aggregate (for example, let's say half of English, baby!'s members 
are females who visit the boards more than the chat rooms) and at the individual 
level (for example, English, baby! User1234 mostly visits the Eavesdropping Lesson). 
Again, this helps the staff produce and appropriately feature tools and content 
tailored to your interests. <br><br> English, baby! collects market research data 
in order to generate sales to corporate clients. Market research data are always 
anonymous and are never used to sell anything to individual respondents based 
on their personal responses. Market research data, however, may be used at the 
aggregate level to: <br> 1. Increase the likelihood that a group's experience 
on English, baby! is relevant to its interests as a whole<br> 2. Formulate group-level 
statistical models that are used to accomplish goal #1 (above). <br><br> English, 
baby!'s market research data is collected in two ways: <br> 1. Among individuals 
who opt-in to take surveys during the registration process or while on English, 
baby! (those who sign up are contacted and take surveys through email).<br> 2. 
Through surveys that we publicly post on English, baby! (it is never mandatory 
to answer these surveys). <br><br> English, baby! uses data at the individual 
level to sell products and services to English, baby! members who express an interest 
in these products and services, through a poll for example, or to members who 
can be presumed to have an interest based on results from a statistical analysis. 
<br> <a href="#top"><font face="arial" size="1">back to top</font></a> <br><br> <a name="6"><b>What 
information does English, baby! log?</b></a><br> When you surf the Internet, your 
browser automatically transmits information to the web sites you visit, including 
English, baby!. Such information includes referral data (URL of the web page you 
were on before coming to English, baby!), IP address and your browser version. 
English, baby! collects this information to help improve services and moderate 
the site. All the information that is automatically submitted by your browser

does English, baby! secure collected information?</b></a><br> Your English, baby! 
Profile is password-protected so that only you and authorized English, baby! employees 
have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, 
do not give your password to anyone. If anyone ever asks you for information claiming 
they are English, baby! staff, check their Member Profile -- if it doesn't say 
they are staff, they're not. Also, if you share a computer, you should sign out 
of your English, baby! account and close the browser window before someone else 
logs on. This will protect your information on public terminals. <br><br> English, 
baby! makes every effort to ensure that your information is secure on its system. 
Only certain authorized English, baby! employees can access this information if 
it's relevant to their job duties. English, baby! has staff dedicated to maintaining 
this Privacy Policy and other privacy initiatives, periodically reviewing web 
security and making sure that every English, baby! employee is aware of our security 
practices. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 
100% secure. As a result, English, baby! cannot guarantee the security of any 
information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. <br><br> <a name="9"><b>With 
whom does English, baby! share information?</b></a><br> When you submit information 
to English, baby!, it is generally collected, processed and maintained solely 
by us. Sometimes we may allow partner companies to collect information about members 
from us or directly from you via their web site. When English, baby! is the source, 
it is usually so that we can provide a service with a partner. We choose to work 
with upstanding companies that will treat your information responsibly. But, since 
we don't own these companies, we can't speak for them on privacy issues. Before 
telling them about yourself, check out their privacy statements. If you are not 
satisfied with their information practices, you can choose to not use their service. 
<br><br> Below is a summary of the situations in which English, baby! might share 
information: <br><br> <b>Co-Branding</b><br> Some of our services, such as English, 
baby! email, are offered in conjunction with partner companies. In order to provide 
these services, English, baby! may choose to share some of you user data (e.g., 
user name and email address). <br> <b>Content Partners</b><br> Some English, baby! 
content is �sponsored by� or �presented by� other companies. English, baby! typically 
shares market research data (how the sponsorship performed, names of contest winners, 
etc.) collected on the site or via email surveys with these partners. This information 
is aggregate and not linked to specific users. <br> <b>Partner Sponsorships</b><br> 
Partners may sponsor promotions, contests and sweepstakes that require you to 
reveal details such as your name, address or phone number. Always check their 
privacy policy before revealing information about yourself. If you don't want 
these sponsors to have your personal information, you can choose to not participate.

may differ from English, baby!'s. <br><br> Finally, English, baby! reserves the 
right to disclose user information from both private and public areas of the site 
if required by law or if given reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that 
someone is causing injury to or interference with the rights of English, baby! 
members or the general public, or with English, baby!'s rights of property. <br>

your personal information. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" colspan="2">You 
can always update the personal information in your Profile by clicking on the

or account settings at any time -- all you need is your member name and password. 
<br><br> So that we can protect the integrity of sensitive data, there are certain 
pieces of information, such as your birthday, that you cannot alter yourself. 
For example, since children under 15 are not allowed to register as English, baby!

ages. <br><br> Our databases automatically update any personal information you

this in mind if you decide to communicate personal information through any of 
these applications. <br> <a href="#top"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">back

action has English, baby! taken to protect children's privacy?</b></font></a><br> 
English, baby! is intended for people 15 or over. Our registration process is

under 13. If it comes to our attention that a member has revealed on English, 
baby! that they are under 13, a member of English, baby!'s Community staff will 
immediately delete the account. <br><br> <b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note
