<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
	This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices of Enquisite Software
	Inc. (“Enquisite”). It is intended to inform our customers and
	visitors to our customers' websites, about Enquisite's data collection and
	usage relating to information we process through Enquisite Software and
	Enquisite Reports (collectively referred to as “Enquisite
	Products”).
</p>

<p>
	If you install or use Enquisite Products, you are subject to this Privacy
	Policy and Software License &amp; Terms Of Service And Conditions Of Use,
	including, but not limited to the limitations on damages, and application
	of the law of the Province of British Columbia.
</p>

<p>
	As our business changes, our Privacy Policy will also change, and we reserve
	the right to change how we handle the information we process on behalf of our
	customers. If you use Enquisite Products, you should check our website
	frequently to see recent changes. If a material change has been made to
	our Privacy Policy, we may also notify our registered users via e-mail
	of such material changes.
</p>

<p>
	<b>What does Enquisite Products do?</b>
</p>

<p>
	We provide web site data analysis services based on information provided by
	our customers regarding interactions visitors have on their websites. We
	use this data to create trend reports (“Enquisite Reports”)
	which analyze search engine traffic patterns. If you are unsure what these
	reports look like, or what information is contained within them, please review the
	<a href="http://enquisite.com/enquisite-metrics-train.pps" title="This is a PowerPoint presentation - 1.64 M">training document</a>.
</p>

<p>
	<b>What Information Does Enquisite Collect From Its Customers and How Is
	That Data Used?</b>
</p>

<p>
	Enquisite's customers are businesses, not individuals. Enquisite collects
	contact and related information from our customers and prospective
	customers who request information or services from Enquisite or who
	register for Enquisite Products. To the extent that any personal contact
	information is collected, we use this contact information for business
	purposes, such as responding to requests for information about Enquisite
	Products and services, providing access to certain services, and for
	registration of Enquisite Products.
</p>

<p>
	By submitting your information to us and by installing and/or using the
	Enquisite Products, you are consenting to our use of your data as described
	herein and are consenting to the Software License &amp; Terms Of Service And
	Conditions Of Use. If you do not consent, you should not register with
	Enquisite and you should not install and/or use the Enquisite Products.
</p>

<p>
	<b>What Information Does Enquisite Collect Through Enquisite Products From
	Visitors to Its Customers' Websites, and How Is That Data Used?</b>
</p>

<p>
	Upon confirmation of sign up, Enquisite provides a Javascript for our
	customers to embed into their websites. The Javascript data
	initiates electronic image requests for a single-pixel gif, also known as
	an action tag or web beacon, which is a small graphic image on a web page
	designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is
	visiting a site. The image is used to count web page accesses and gather
	some general statistical information, such as the IP address of a visitor's
	computer, the URL of the page the tag comes from and the time it was
	viewed, log files and other traffic data, such as referring search engine
	name, rank on the page, search query initiated and browser used (collectively
	referred to as “statistical data”). We do not collect any
	personally identifiable information from visitors to our customers'
	websites.
</p>

<p>
	The statistical data collected is processed by Enquisite to produce
	Enquisite Reports which aggregate the data collected for our customers.
</p>

<p>
	Enquisite requests that its customers adopt privacy policies that fully
	inform visitors to the customers' websites about the customers' installation
	and use of the Enquisite Products and the collection of statistical data
	from their visitors. Enquisite customers must also represent that this data
	collection does not violate any laws, confidentiality or
	other obligations between customers and their visitors.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Is Information Shared With Third Parties?</b>
</p>

<p>
	Enquisite does not sell, share, or distribute any private or personal information with any third parties. 
</p>

<p>
	We may however employ other companies and individuals to perform functions
	on our behalf. Examples include registering users, sending postal mail and
	email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and providing
	customer service. To perform these functions, these companies and
	individuals may have access to information needed to perform their
	functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
</p>

<p>
	As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy assets. In
	such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred
	business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Enquisite or
	substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of
	course be one of the transferred assets.
</p>

<p>
	We may also release information when we believe release is appropriate to
	comply with the law; enforce or apply our Software License &amp; Terms Of
	Service And Conditions Of Use and other agreements; or to protect the
	rights, property, or safety of Enquisite, our users, or others. This
	includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for
	fraud protection.
</p>

<p>
	<b>How Can I Access and Update My Customer Information?</b>
</p>

<p>
	Customers that provided contact information may contact Enquisite at our 
	<a href="http://www.enquisite.com/support.html">Support Page</a> to update
	their contact information.
