<h3>Enquisite Privacy Policy - Effective May 19, 2009</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Enquisite, Inc., a Delaware corporation (”Enquisite”). It is intended to inform our customers and visitors to our and our customers’ websites, about Enquisite’s data collection and usage relating to information we may collect on our website as well as information we process through Enquisite’s products and services (collectively “Enquisite Products”).</p>
<p>By submitting your information to us or by installing and/or using the Enquisite Products, you are consenting to our use of your data as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>As our business changes, our Privacy Policy will also change, and we reserve the right to change how we handle the information we collect. You should check our website frequently to see any changes to our Privacy Policy. If a material change has been made to our Privacy Policy, we may also notify our registered users via e-mail.</p>
<h3>Information Collection and Use - Our Website</h3>
<p>We collect contact information, such as name, address, email address and/or phone number, and credit card information for online registration of Enquisite Products. We use this information to provide services that are requested by our website visitors, customers or prospective customers (for example, to respond to your request for further information about us or our services, send a requested newsletter or white paper, or provision a customer to use Enquisite Products).</p>
<p>We consider your personal information highly confidential and will not pass it on to anyone outside of Enquisite and its affiliates and resellers, except where required to do so by law or to prevent a crime or violation of our customer contract. Affiliates, and resellers are authorized agents/resellers of Enquisite Products. We may pass on your information to them to complete a particular service or offer you requested from our website.</p>
<p>If you participate in any customer case studies or online discussions posted on the Enquisite website, you should be aware that any information you share is visible to other users. Personally identifiable information you submit to one of these forums can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
<p>We may collect general demographic and profile data on our website from time to time in order to better understand and assist our customers and to help improve our site. This data is used only in anonymous form and does not identify you or your personal details. We also reserve the right to aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to third parties for marketing, promotional, and other purposes as long as we do not disclose any information that could be used to identify you personally.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Service Providers</strong>. We use other third parties to provide certain services, such as sending postal mail and e-mail, or processing credit card payments, on our behalf. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Service-related Announcements</strong>. If you are a customer of Enquisite, we will send you strictly service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so. For instance, we may send you an email if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance. You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Service.</strong> Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we may send you a Welcome email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you, by email or telephone, in response to your inquiries.</p>

<p><strong>What Information Does Enquisite Collect Through Enquisite Products From Visitors to Its Customers’ Websites, and How Is That Data Used?</strong> Upon confirmation of sign up, we provide a Javascript code for our customers to embed into their websites to gather certain general statistical information, such as the IP address of a visitor’s computer, the URL of the page the tag comes from and the time it was viewed, log files and other traffic data (collectively referred to as “statistical data”). Enquisite does not collect any personally identifiable information from visitors to our customers’ websites.</p>
<p>The statistical data collected is processed by the Enquisite Products to produce reports that aggregate the data collected for our customers. We generally requests our customers to adopt privacy policies that fully inform visitors to the customers’ websites about the collection and use of statistical data from their visitors.</p>
