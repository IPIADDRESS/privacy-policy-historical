						This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to <a href="http://www.loudeye.com" target="_blank">www.loudeye.com</a> (the "Site"), which is owned and operated by Loudeye Corp.  Please note that this Policy does not apply to the Loudeye Radio Player. For information about the privacy policy that applies to the Loudeye Radio Player, please visit <a href="http://radio.player.loudeye.com/radioPlayer/tab_my_help/policy_privacy.html" target="_blank">http://radio.player.loudeye.com/radioPlayer/tab_my_help/policy_privacy.html</a>. Except as provided below, we do not collect any personally identifiable information about you while you use the Site. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.
						</p>
						<p>
						Please note that if we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this Policy in this section of the Site, and other places we deem appropriate so that our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what, if any, circumstances we disclose it. We will always use any information collected in accordance with the privacy policy in place at the time the information was collected.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Information We Collect: How We Use Information We Collect</strong><br>
						Except in the limited circumstances provided below, we do not collect any personally identifiable information while you use the Site. The cases in which we do collect personally identifiable information are as follows:
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Newsletter</strong><br>
						On our Site we make available "Viewpoint," a newsletter with the intention of providing you with the inside track into the trends and new technologies in the digital music industry. If you elect to receive the newsletter we will ask you to subscribe and provide the following information: your name, company name (if applicable) and email address. This information will only be used to send the newsletter. If, at any time you wish to un-subscribe, you can do so by sending an email to <a href="mailto:newsletter@loudeye.com&amp;subject=unsubscribe">newsletter@loudeye.com</a> with "unsubscribe" in the subject header. 
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Music Labels</strong><br>
						If you represent a music label and are interested in participating in Loudeye services (e.g., services that allow Loudeye customers access to samples of music in your music catalog or that allow us to include your music when we deliver files to licensed users, such as XM Radio), you can request a service agreement on our site. When you request an agreement, we will ask you for the name of your label and any sublabels, as well as an address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address and an individual contact name. This information will only be used to send you the agreement you have requested. 
						<br><br>
						We also collect and use certain types of non-personally identifiable information.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
						A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.

A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. 
						<br><br>
						Loudeye uses cookies to create profiles of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on non-specific users, which details user preferences. We use this profile to tailor each user's interaction with the Site and to personalize our Site to your particular interests.
						<br><br>
						This Policy covers the use of cookies by Loudeye only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers that may advertise through the Site.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Enhancement of Marketing Profile</strong><br>
						We purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and provide offers we think our users would be interested in. We use this information to enhance the existing user profiles. This aggregate marketing data is tied to your user profile and used to tailor your interaction with the Site.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Log Files</strong><br>
						Like most standard website servers, we use log files. This includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), platform type, and date/time stamp. This information is not linked to any personally identifiable information about you. We collect and use this information in aggregate to tailor our services and to share with advertisers.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Children</strong><br>
						We may require you to provide your age and date of birth in order to insure compliance with U.S. government restrictions on web sites providing content to, and acquiring information from, children.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</strong><br>
						We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to outside parties. Loudeye may share aggregate statistical information about our users, traffic patterns, and related site information with reputable third-party associates and vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. 
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Business Transition</strong><br>
						In the event that Loudeye goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' information, in most instances, be a part of the assets transferred. Such a transfer shall not be considered a violation of or deviation from this Policy.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Links to Third Party Sites</strong><br>
						This Site contains links to other unaffiliated sites. Please be aware that Loudeye is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware of when you leave the Site and to read the privacy policies of each website you visit. This Policy applies solely to information collected on this Site.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Our Commitment to Data Security</strong><br>
						To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</strong><br>
						Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain personally identifiable information from anyone we know to be under the age of 13.
