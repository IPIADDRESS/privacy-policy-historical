					<b>Privacy Policy for ENCYCLOPEDIA.COMâ„¢</b><br>
					Alacritude, LLC respects the privacy of our users. We have created this
					policy in order to demonstrate our privacy commitment to our users.
					By coming to a Alacritude site, you are agreeing to and accepting this
					Privacy Policy as well as the terms and conditions or other end
					user agreement for that site.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We will not distribute information that identifies you individually
						or reveals your identity ("Identifying Information") unless
						you give your prior approval in response to a request made by
						Alacritude or unless distribution of this information is permitted
						under this Privacy Policy. Your electronic approval will qualify
						as your consent for this purpose.</li>
					<li> We will not make Identifying Information available publicly
						without the prior written or electronic consent of the individual
						identified unless (a) the information is already publicly available;
						(b) required by law, court order, or as requested by other government
						or law enforcement authority; or (c) the information is posted
						by the user to an on-line bulletin board, chat room, news groups,
						or other public forum.</li>
					<li> We may collect and use information about you and your use
						of the Alacritude sites, including Identifying Information, for
						our own internal purposes such as, for example, analyzing usage
						of the Alacritude sites in order to improve them. </li>
					<li> We may use and/or distribute information about you and your
						use of the Alacritude sites in forms that do not identify you individually
						or reveal your identity. </li>
					<li> Advertisements, promotional offers, promotional emails, "free
						gifts," and links, for example, on the Alacritude sites or sent
						via email or other means from Alacritude may ask for Identifying
						Information from you. If you provide this information, your
						Identifying Information may be provided (either directly from
						you or by Alacritude) to the advertiser or web site or company making
						the offer or providing the gift. You may opt-out regarding how
						Identifying Information collected from you may be used or distributed
						when provided to Alacritude at a Alacritude site by either following
						the applicable instructions and links on the site, in the email
						or other document, or by sending an email to the Alacritude site
						Web Master at info@encyclopedia.com or as otherwise posted on
						the Alacritude sites. To ensure that your opt-out email is effective,
						you must include the words "opt-out" and "Identifying Information"
						in the subject field of such email. </li>
					<li> Of course, if you make a purchase by credit card or otherwise
						provide your credit card information, the relevant data will
						be transmitted to Alacritude's vendor providing such payment processing
						service. Similarly, if you are using a co-branded site of Alacritude
						and at least one other third party (indicated by the inclusion
						of another party's name or product/service name either in the
						URL or site or by the inclusion of a third party's(ies') logos
						or trademarks in the site), your Identifying Information may
						be used and/or distributed by Alacritude pursuant to this Privacy
						Policy and by the other party(ies) pursuant to this Policy and/or
						their applicable policy(ies).</li>
					<li> Alacritude may send users, via email or other means, information
						relating to Alacritude sites and/or information on specials, new
						products and/or promotions from our marketing partners/colleagues.
						The information described in these messages is intended to be
						of high interest or value to our users. To choose not to receive
						such messages, a user can simply click or go to a URL link located
						in every email or other message containing this kind of information,
						which will remove the user from future mailings. Or, for certain
						sites a user may edit his/her personal account information,
						which contains an option on receiving special offers, at any
						time by clicking the appropriate link on the applicable Alacritude
						site. </li>
					<li>In the course of our business, Alacritude might buy or sell sites
						or assets. In these kinds of transactions, customer information
						(such as Identifying Information) is usually one of the transferred
						business assets. In the event that Alacritude, its parent, subsidiaries,
						or affiliates is acquired, merged, or otherwise combined with
						another party, customer information (such as Identifying Information)
						will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
					<li>Alacritude may use other companies and persons to perform certain
						functions for us. These functions might include, for example,
						processing credit card payments, providing customer service,
						and sending email. These other companies and persons may have
						access to customer information (such as Identifying Information)
						that's needed to perform their functions, but they are not authorized
						to use it for any other purposes. In addition, we may share
						information with other affiliated companies and joint ventures,
						for example, but we ask those companies to honor the standards
						of this Privacy Policy. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>In order to provide our users with a more complete understanding
					of how the Alacritude sites collect and use information from our users,
					we have provided the following information:</p>
				<p><b>Internet Protocol (IP) Address</b><br>
					The Alacritude sites log IP addresses for systems administration, diagnostic,
					and site tracking purposes, and to report aggregate information
					to advertisers. The Alacritude sites do not link IP addresses to information
					identifying users individually.</p>
				<p><b>Cookies</b><br>
					The Alacritude sites use files called "cookies" to store usernames,
					passwords, and other user preferences so that users don't have
					to re-enter this information each time they use a particular Alacritude
					site. You should be aware that advertisers serving ads on the Alacritude
					sites may use their own cookies.</p>
				<p><b>Information Collection and Opt-Out</b><br>
					The Alacritude sites' registration forms ask users to enter contact
					information (like their email address), general information (like
					their city, state), and demographic information (like their zip
					code, age, or income level). The forms also require unique identifiers
					(username and password) so that users can be verified when they
					access the Alacritude sites. The contact information primarily is used
					to send users daily emails and other information they have requested
					and other information as stated in this Privacy Policy. Users may
					opt out of receiving future email updates by clicking on or going
					to the applicable link in any email or other document and following
					the instructions. The demographic information is used among other
					things, to tailor users' experiences at the Alacritude sites, distribute
					and show you content that we think you might be interested in,
					and display site content according to your preferences. </p>
				<p>In addition, advertisers or web sites that have links on the Alacritude
					sites may collect personally identifiable information about you.
					The privacy and information practices of those advertisers or web
					sites linked to the Alacritude sites are not covered by this Privacy
					Policy. </p>
				<p><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b><br>
					This Privacy Policy is subject to modification from time to time.
					You may be notified: (1) in an email sent to the email address
					you have provided to Alacritude through the Alacritude sites, or (2) Alacritude's
					posting of a notice for at least 30 days on this web site or the
					applicable Alacritude site that the Alacritude sites Privacy Policy has
					been changed. Should you wish to opt-out of such modifications
					to the Privacy Policy, you may do so by either following the applicable
					instructions and links on the site or email or sending an email
					to the Alacritude sites Web Master at the email address below, making
					sure to include the words "opt-out" and "modification" in the subject
					field.</p>
				<p>If you have any questions regarding this policy, please contact:<br>
