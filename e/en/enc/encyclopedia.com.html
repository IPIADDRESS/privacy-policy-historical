							<b>Privacy Policy for ENCYCLOPEDIA.COM</b><br>
							HighBeam esearch, Inc. respects the privacy of our users. We have created this 
							policy in order to demonstrate our privacy commitment to our users. By coming 
							to a HighBeam Research site, you are agreeing to and accepting this Privacy 
							Policy as well as the terms and conditions or other end user agreement for that 
							site.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
							We will not distribute information that identifies you individually or reveals 
							your identity ("Identifying Information") unless you give your prior approval 
							in response to a request made by HighBeam Research or unless distribution of 
							this information is permitted under this Privacy Policy. Your electronic 
							approval will qualify as your consent for this purpose.
							</li><li>
							We will not make Identifying Information available publicly without the prior 
							written or electronic consent of the individual identified unless (a) the 
							information is already publicly available; (b) required by law, court order, or 
							as requested by other government or law enforcement authority; or (c) the 
							information is posted by the user to an on-line bulletin board, chat room, news 
							groups, or other public forum.
							</li><li>
							We may collect and use information about you and your use of the HighBeam 
							Research sites, including Identifying Information, for our own internal 
							purposes such as, for example, analyzing usage of the HighBeam Research sites 
							in order to improve them.
							</li><li>
							We may use and/or distribute information about you and your use of the HighBeam 
							Research sites in forms that do not identify you individually or reveal your 
							identity.
							</li><li>
							Advertisements, promotional offers, promotional emails, "free gifts," and 
							links, for example, on the HighBeam Research sites or sent via email or other 
							means from HighBeam Research may ask for Identifying Information from you. If 
							you provide this information, your Identifying Information may be provided 
							(either directly from you or by HighBeam Research) to the advertiser or web 
							site or company making the offer or providing the gift. You may opt-out 
							regarding how Identifying Information collected from you may be used or 
							distributed when provided to HighBeam Research at a HighBeam Research site by 
							either following the applicable instructions and links on the site, in the 
							email or other document, or by sending an email to the HighBeam Research site 
							Web Master at info@encyclopedia.com or as otherwise posted on the HighBeam 
							Research sites. To ensure that your opt-out email is effective, you must 
							include the words "opt-out" and "Identifying Information" in the subject field 
							of such email.
							</li><li>
							Of course, if you make a purchase by credit card or otherwise provide your 
							credit card information, the relevant data will be transmitted to HighBeam 
							Research's vendor providing such payment processing service. Similarly, if you 
							are using a co-branded site of HighBeam Research and at least one other third 
							party (indicated by the inclusion of another party's name or product/service 
							name either in the URL or site or by the inclusion of a third party's(ies') 
							logos or trademarks in the site), your Identifying Information may be used 
							and/or distributed by HighBeam Research pursuant to this Privacy Policy and by 
							the other party(ies) pursuant to this Policy and/or their applicable 
							policy(ies).
							</li><li>
							HighBeam Research may send users, via email or other means, information 
							relating to HighBeam Research sites and/or information on specials, new 
							products and/or promotions from our marketing partners/colleagues. The 
							information described in these messages is intended to be of high interest or 
							value to our users. To choose not to receive such messages, a user can simply 
							click or go to a URL link located in every email or other message containing 
							this kind of information, which will remove the user from future mailings. Or, 
							for certain sites a user may edit his/her personal account information, which 
							contains an option on receiving special offers, at any time by clicking the 
							appropriate link on the applicable HighBeam Research site.
							</li><li>
							In the course of our business, HighBeam Research might buy or sell sites or 
							assets. In these kinds of transactions, customer information (such as 
							Identifying Information) is usually one of the transferred business assets. In 
							the event that HighBeam Research, its parent, subsidiaries, or affiliates is 
							acquired, merged, or otherwise combined with another party, customer 
							information (such as Identifying Information) will be one of the transferred 
							assets.
							</li><li>
								HighBeam Research may use other companies and persons to perform certain 
								functions for us. These functions might include, for example, processing credit 
								card payments, providing customer service, and sending email. These other 
								companies and persons may have access to customer information (such as 
								Identifying Information) that's needed to perform their functions, but they are 
								not authorized to use it for any other purposes. In addition, we may share 
								information with other affiliated companies and joint ventures, for example, 
								but we ask those companies to honor the standards of this Privacy Policy.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>In order to provide our users with a more complete understanding of how the 
							HighBeam Research sites collect and use information from our users, we have 
							provided the following information:</p>
						<p><b>Internet Protocol (IP) Address</b><br>
							The HighBeam Research sites log IP addresses for systems administration, 
							diagnostic, and site tracking purposes, and to report aggregate information to 
							advertisers. The HighBeam esearch sites do not link IP addresses to information 
							identifying users individually.</p>
						<p><b>Cookies</b><br>
							The HighBeam Research sites use files called "cookies" to store usernames, 
							passwords, and other user preferences so that users don't have to re-enter this 
							information each time they use a particular HighBeam Research site. You should 
							be aware that advertisers serving ads on the HighBeam Research sites may use 
							their own cookies.</p>
						<p><b>Information Collection and Opt-Out</b><br>
							The HighBeam Research sites' registration forms ask users to enter contact 
							information (like their email address), general information (like their city, 
							state), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income 
							level). The forms also require unique identifiers (username and password) so 
							that users can be verified when they access the HighBeam Research sites. The 
							contact information primarily is used to send users daily emails and other 
							information they have requested and other information as stated in this Privacy 
							Policy. Users may opt out of receiving future email updates by clicking on or 
							going to the applicable link in any email or other document and following the 
							instructions. The demographic information is used among other things, to tailor 
							users' experiences at the HighBeam Research sites, distribute and show you 
							content that we think you might be interested in, and display site content 
							according to your preferences.
						</p>
						<p>In addition, advertisers or web sites that have links on the HighBeam Research 
							sites may collect personally identifiable information about you. The privacy 
							and information practices of those advertisers or web sites linked to the 
							HighBeam Research sites are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
						</p>
						<p><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b><br>
							This Privacy Policy is subject to modification from time to time. You may be 
							notified: (1) in an email sent to the email address you have provided to 
							HighBeam Research through the HighBeam Research sites, or (2) HighBeam 
							Research's posting of a notice for at least 30 days on this web site or the 
							applicable HighBeam Research site that the HighBeam Research sites Privacy 
							Policy has been changed. Should you wish to opt-out of such modifications to 
							the Privacy Policy, you may do so by either following the applicable 
							instructions and links on the site or email or sending an email to the HighBeam 
							Research sites Web Master at the email address below, making sure to include 
							the words "opt-out" and "modification" in the subject field.</p>
