				<h3>What The Parties Will Do With Your Information</h3>
				<p>The Parties will neither sell nor share the personal information you provide or we collect through the website for Enough to any unaffiliated organization without your permission, with the following exceptions.  We may share personal information with third parties who provide services, such as website hosting or other services of an administrative or technical nature, solely for the purpose of providing such services and subject to confidentiality obligations.  In addition, we reserve the right to disclose personal information about visitors:  if we believe in good faith that the law permits it; to protect the rights, property, safety or security of the Parties, our visitors, our registered users or the public; to respond to an emergency; or to enforce any terms of use agreement governing use of a website controlled or operated by us.</p>
				<p>From time to time, we may send you information from other like-minded organizations whose products or services we think subscribers might find interesting, but we do not exchange, trade, rent, or give email lists to unaffiliated third parties.</p>
                <p>"<em>Special Ante Up for Africa Note</em>: For the special <a href="https://ssl1.americanprogress.org/dia/organizationsCAP/americanprogress/shop/custom.jsp?donate_page_KEY=2103&amp;t=anteup.dwt">Ante Up for Africa event</a> on July 5, 2007 and the associated unique donation page, we will share limited contact and donation information with the Ante Up for Africa organizers, Don Cheadle, Annie Duke, and Norman Epstein (the "Organizers").

We will collect relevant contact information and enable you to self-select the type of information that you'd like to receive. You will be able to unsubscribe from communications you receive from us by following the directions included in each such communication.</p>
				
				<h3>If You Submit Information To Public Areas Of The Website For Enough</h3>
				<p>Please be aware that if you decide to disclose personally identifiable information on a publicly-accessible area of the website for Enough (such as a blog), this information may become public.  The Parties do not control the acts of other visitors to the Enough website, so please be cautious when deciding to reveal personal information on a public area of the site.  Please contact us if you believe a visitor to the website for Enough is improperly collecting or using information about you or other users.</p>

Contact information will be stored in a secure location, and financial information will not be stored except when it is needed for record-keeping purposes.</p>
				
				<h3>Cookies</h3>
				<p>A cookie is a small piece of information that a website can store on a computer and later use to recognize a user.  The purpose of cookies is to enhance your ability to receive the information you want.  The Parties may use cookies to enhance the experience of users.

				<h3>IP Addresses And Log File Data</h3>
				<p>IP addresses are ID numbers for the location of your computer or network on the internet.  Log files are recordings of the traffic to and from a server.  The servers hosting the website for Enough log IP addresses for systems administration and troubleshooting.   We track page hits in the aggregate to track the popularity of pages that people visit.  With that information we can improve the quality of the site.</p>
				
				<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
				<p>The Parties are concerned about the safety and privacy of children online.  Because of this, we will make all efforts to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulations establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. We do not and will not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13, and we will develop our site with the capacity to block acceptance of information from children under 13 whenever age-related information is requested.</p>
				<p>It is possible that by fraud or deception by others we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately obtain parental consent or else delete the information from our servers. If you want to notify us of our receipt of information by children under 13, please do so by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:progress@amprog.org">progress@amprog.org</a></p>
				
				<h3>Security</h3>
				<p>The Parties have measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of visitor personally identifiable information that is under our control.  For example, only select staff and contracted individuals have access to personally identifiable information provided by visitors to non-public areas of our sites.  We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving sensitive personal and financial data from our site. Please note, however, that security breaches can occur even if reasonable steps are taken to prevent such breaches; for example, we cannot guarantee that information provided through our sites will not be illegally accessed on our servers or intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.  Please contact us if you believe there has been any breach of the security of our sites.</p> 
				
				<h3>Please Note</h3>
				<p>The Parties plan to regularly update and add new features to the website for Enough.  Because of this, the Parties expect to revise this privacy policy as the site develops.  Such amendments will be posted in the privacy policy section of the site.  You can determine whether privacy policy has been modified since your last visit by checking the "Last updated" legend at the top of the policy.  As stated above, the spirit of this policy will be maintained.  The Parties may link to other like-minded websites, but is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of those websites.  Additionally, both American Progress and Crisis Group and their affiliates have separate content and privacy policies for their websites, which you should consult when accessing areas of their websites.</p>
