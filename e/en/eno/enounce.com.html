    <p>Enounce, Incorporated is committed to your privacy and has developed this privacy
    statement to notify you of what personally identifiable information of yours or third
    party personally identification is collected from you, how this information is used and
    what choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the
    information. </p>
    <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong><br>
    Enounce, Incorporated collects information from our users at several different points on
    our web site, on product order forms, and	 through product registration. Enounce,
    Incorporated is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. Enounce,
    Incorporated won't share, license or sell data to third parties. Enounce, Incorporated will
    not give e-mail names to any of our partners and affiliates. </p>
    <p><strong>Registration</strong><br>
    In some cases a user must register to use our software products. During registration a
    user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This
    information is used solely for the purposes of customer support or to contact the user
    about software upgrades only for the product they have registered. At the time of
    registration a user may indicate that they do not want to be contacted with any news or
    notices.</p>



    <p><strong>Order</strong><br>
    We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact
    information (like name and billing address) and financial information (like credit card
    number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill
    customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is
    used to get in touch with the user. </p>
    <p><strong>Log Files</strong><br>
    We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements, and
    gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to
    personally identifiable information. </p>
    <p><strong>Sharing</strong><br>
    We will only share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers.
    This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We
    use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. This
    company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any
    secondary purposes. </p>
    <p><strong>Links</strong><br>
    This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Enounce Incorporated is
    not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We
    encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy
    statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.
    This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. </p>
      <p><strong>Security</strong><br>
    This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit
    sensitive information via the web site, your information is protected both on-line and
    off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such
    as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is
    protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page,
    such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape
    Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or
    open, when you are just 'surfing'. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive
    information on-line, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information
    off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned
    above, is restricted in our offices or on servers within our control. Only employees who
    need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a
    customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable
    information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy
    practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are
    notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to
    ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store
    personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. If you have any
    questions about the security at our web site, please submit a request using
      our <a href="contact/inforeq.php">Customer Service Form</a>. </p>
    <p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong><br>
    Users who do not want to receive information about our products have this option at the
    time they register their product. Users who no longer wish to receive information about
    our products may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to any email with
    unsubscribe in the subject line of the email or contacting us using our <a href="contact/inforeq.php">Customer
    Service Form</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br>
    If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so
    our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under
    circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally
    identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was
    collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether
    or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in
    accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. </p>
    <p><strong>Contacting Us about Privacy</strong><br>
    If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of our software or
    Web sites, you may contact: </p>
