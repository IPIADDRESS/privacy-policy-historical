<div id="privacy-policy">
<div id="privacy-policy" style="padding:20px"><p>This Ensogo Malaysia privacy policy (the "Privacy
Policy") is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding
the collection, use and disclosure of any information you submit to us through Ensogo
Malaysia. This includes "Personal Information," which is information
about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, e-mail address,
user ID number, delivery and billing addresses and other non-public information
that is associated with the foregoing, as well as "Anonymous
Information," which is information that is not associated with or linked
to your Personal Information and does not permit the identification of
individual persons.</p>

<p><b>User
Consent</b></p>

<p>By accessing or otherwise using Ensogo Malaysia, you
agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated
into and forms a part of the Ensogo Malaysia terms of service. You expressly
consent to the processing of your Personal Information and Anonymous
Information according to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Your Personal Information may be processed and stored

stringent than the laws in your country. Your Personal Information will not,
however, be used or disclosed for purposes for which you have not given consent
or which are not permitted under applicable law.</p>

<p><b>Regarding
Children</b></p>

<p>Children under the age of 18 are not permitted to use Ensogo
Malaysia and we do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Information
from those who are under 18 years old. Protecting the privacy of children is
very important to us. Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under
18, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information permanently
from our databases. We recommend that children between the ages of 13 and 18
obtain their parent’s permission before submitting information over the
internet. By using Ensogo Malaysia, you are representing that you are at least
18 years old, or that you are at least 13 years old and have a parent’s or
guardian’s permission to use Ensogo Malaysia.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Collection
of Information</b></p>

<p><b>Personal
Information That You Provide</b></p>

<p>In general, we collect Personal Information that you
submit to us voluntarily through Ensogo Malaysia. We also collect information
that you submit in the process of creating or editing your account and user
profile on Ensogo Malaysia. For example, our registration and login process
requires you to provide us with your name, valid email address and password of
your choice. When you personalize your profile and use the features of Ensogo
Malaysia, we will collect any information you voluntarily provide, and we may
also request optional information to support your use of Ensogo Malaysia, such
as your year of birth, gender and other demographic information. We collect
information in the form of the content that you submit during your use of Ensogo
Malaysia, such as photos, reviews, ratings and other information you choose to
submit. We may also collect information about you and your friends who use Ensogo
Malaysia, from any social network you may have connected from, in order to
provide you with a more personalized experience. For instance, we may collect
your user ID or profile information that you have permitted to be displayed
through Ensogo Malaysia in order to display you as a friend or in association
with your profile and collections. When you purchase a Deal or an Ensogo
Malaysia Product, you may need to submit your credit card or other payment
information so that our service providers can process your payment for the Deal
or Ensogo Malaysia Product. When you sign up for, or win, any contests,
sweepstakes, or other activities that we make available on Ensogo Malaysia, we
will collect the information designated along with such activity, which may
include your contact information such as your address and phone number. If you
choose to sign up to receive information about products or services that may be
of interest to you, we will collect your email address and other related
information. Additionally, we collect any information that you voluntarily
enter, including Personal Information, into any postings, comments, or forums
within the Ensogo community.</p>

<p><b>Personal
Information From Other Sources</b></p>

<p>We may receive Personal Information about you from
other sources with which you have registered, companies who we have partnered
with (collectively, "Partners") or other third parties. We may
associate this information with the other Personal Information we have
collected about you.</p>

<p><b>E-Mail
And E-Mail Addresses</b></p>

<p>If you send an e-mail to us, or fill out our
"Feedback" form through Ensogo Malaysia, we will collect your e-mail
address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files, and
other information you provide. We may use and display your full name and email
address when you send an email notification to a friend through Ensogo Malaysia
or the social network from which you have connected to Ensogo Malaysia &nbsp;(such as in an invitation, or when sharing
your content). Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf
of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message) or
notifications from a social network or other website with whom you have
registered to receive such notifications. We may use this e-mail address to
contact you, for things such as notifications of limited edition shop sales and
other related information. You may indicate your preference to stop receiving
further promotional communications as further detailed below.</p>

<p><b>Information
Collected Via Technology</b></p>

<p>As you use Ensogo Malaysia, certain information may
also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers’ server
logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating
system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource
Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit
and the solutions and information for which you have browsed, tagged to your
account and/or purchased or on which of the advertisements displayed on Ensogo Malaysia
you clicked. This type of information is collected to make Ensogo Malaysia and
solutions more useful to you and to tailor the experience with Ensogo Malaysia
to meet your special interests and needs.</p>

<p>We engage in remarketing to market our sites across
the web. When a user visits our site, a cookie is dropped on the user. Users
with this cookie may be targeted across advertising networks to receive
relevant advertisements. You may opt out of this ad serving using the Network
Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt-out page (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>).</p>

<p>An "Internet protocol address" or "IP
Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when
you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser
session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider,
your IP Address probably varies from session to session. For example, we, or
our service providers, may track your IP Address when you access Ensogo to
assist with ad targeting.</p>

<p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information
that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a
website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web
browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete
them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with Ensogo
Malaysia. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser
help file directions. In order to use our services offered through Ensogo
Malaysia, your web browser must accept Cookies. If you choose to disable
Cookies, some aspects of Ensogo Malaysia may not work properly, and you may not
be able to receive our services.</p>

<p>We may also enable advertisers and ad servers to
promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on Ensogo
Malaysia. These advertisers and ad servers may use Cookies and/or "Web
Beacons" (which are usually small, transparent graphic images) in order to
monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such
advertisements will direct you to the website of a third-party and the
advertiser. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any
advertisers or ad servers.</p>

<p><b>Use and
Disclosure of Information</b></p>

<p>Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we
do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share for marketing purposes the
Personal Information that we collect with third parties, unless you ask or
authorize us to do so.</p>

<p>In general, Personal Information you submit to us is
used by us to provide you access to Ensogo Malaysia to process your Ensogo Malaysia
orders, to improve Ensogo Malaysia, to better tailor the features, performance,
and support of Ensogo Malaysia &nbsp;and to
offer you additional information, opportunities, promotions and functionality
from us, our partners or our advertisers at your request. Additionally, we do
share your content preferences and other information with the social network
with which you have connected to Ensogo Malaysia, along with those companies
and persons you have asked us to share your information with.</p>

<p>We may disclose your Personal Information to other
businesses within the Ensogo group, and to reputable third parties who will help
process your order. Ensogo Malaysia requires all such third parties to treat
your personal information as fully confidential and to fully comply with all
applicable Malaysian personal data protection and consumer legislation from
time to time in place. We may provide your Personal Information to third-party
service providers who work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the
services and features of Ensogo Malaysia and to help us communicate with you
and manage Ensogo Products via the Marketplace (for example process your orders
and returns). Examples of such services include sending email, analyzing data,
providing marketing assistance, processing payments (including credit card
payments), delivering Ensogo Products and providing customer service. We
require our third-party service providers to promise not to use such
information except as necessary to provide the relevant services to us. We may
share some or all of your Personal Information (other than credit card information)
with Merchants whose Deals you have purchased for their commercial purposes and
to provision the Deal... If you do not want us to use or disclose Personal
Information collected about you in the manner identified in this Privacy
Policy, you may not use Ensogo Malaysia.</p>

<p>We also process your payment card details in order to
complete any purchase that you make through our Site and, in certain instances,
disclose your personal data to third party credit reference agencies to perform
credit checks against you. When you place an order with us, we may offer to
retain your payment card details for your convenience to save you having to
re-enter these details on a future occasion. However, if you prefer that we do
not maintain these details, you can go to 'My Account', click on ‘edit or
delete’ and delete any card information that we hold about you.</p>

<p>Additionally, we may create Anonymous Information
records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name)
that would otherwise make the Anonymous Information personally identifiable to
you. Generally, we aggregate this information and use it in statistical
analysis to help us analyze patterns in the use of Ensogo. This Privacy Policy
does not limit our use or disclosure of any Anonymous Information in any way,
and we reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information to our
partners, advertisers and other third parties in our discretion.</p>

<p>We may share some or all of your Personal Information
with Ensogo Malaysia affiliated and group companies that are under a common
control, so that they may send daily deal e-mails to you, in which case we will
require them to honor this Privacy Policy. Some of those companies may be
located in countries that do not require an equivalent or greater level of
protection of Personal Information.</p>

<p>In the event we go through a business transition such
as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our
assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge
that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and
that any acquirer of ours or that acquirer’s assets may continue to process
your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We may disclose your Personal Information if we
believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with
relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to
protect and defend our rights or property, you, or third parties. You hereby
consent to us sharing your Personal Information under the circumstances
described herein.</p>

<p>Please note that your personal information may be
transferred, stored and processed outside Malaysia.</p>

<p><b>The
Ability Of Others To View Your Information</b></p>

<p>Helping you to protect your information is a vital
part of our mission. It is up to you to make sure you are comfortable with the

media applications and other public forums in which you choose to participate.
Please keep in mind that if you choose to disclose Personal Information when
posting comments or other information or content through Ensogo Malaysia, this

others, including people outside the Ensogo community. We will not have any
obligations with respect to any information that you post to parts of Ensogo available
to others, and recommend that you use caution when giving out personal
information to others through social media networks or otherwise.</p>

statements of each and every website they visit. This Privacy Policy applies
solely to information collected by us through Ensogo Malaysia and does not
apply to these third-party websites. The ability to access information of
third-parties from Ensogo Malaysia, or links to other websites or locations, is
for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such

<p>Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information</p>

<p>We offer you choices regarding the collection, use,
and sharing of your Personal Information. You have a right at any time to stop
us from contacting you for marketing purposes. When you receive promotional
communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further
promotional communications from us and you will have the opportunity to
"opt-out" by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the
promotional e-mail you receive or by contacting us directly at&nbsp;my.help.ensogo.com.</p>

<p>Despite your indicated email marketing preferences, we
may send you administrative emails regarding Ensogo Malaysia, including, for
example, administrative and transactional confirmations, and notices of updates
to our Privacy Policy if we choose to provide such notices to you in this
manner.</p>

<p>We want to make sure that your information is accurate
and up-to-date. You may ask us to correct or remove information which you think
is inaccurate. You may change any of your profile information by editing it in
the profile settings page.</p>

<p><b>Feedback</b></p>

<p>If you provide feedback to us, we may use and disclose
such feedback for any purpose, provided we do not associate such feedback with
your Personal Information. We will collect any information contained in such
feedback and will treat the Personal Information in it in accordance with this
Privacy Policy. You agree that any such comments and any email we receive
becomes our property. We may use feedback for marketing purposes or to add to
or modify our services without paying any royalties or other compensation to
you.</p>

<p><b>Security</b></p>

<p>We are committed to protecting the security of your
Personal Information. We use a variety of industry-standard security
technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from
unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Even though we have taken significant
steps to protect your Personal Information, no company, including us, can fully
eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information.</p>

<p><b>Contact and
Revisions</b></p>

<p>If you have questions or concerns about our Privacy
Policy, please contact us at:&nbsp;my.help@ensogo.com.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revision
at our discretion, and if we make any substantial changes in the way we use
your Personal Information, we will post an alert on this page. If you object to
any such changes, you must cease using Ensogo. Continued use of Ensogo Malaysia
following notice of any such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of
such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such
changes.</p>
