                password and email address. We will only use such information 
                for the purposes for which it was requested, such as for site 
                administration, to protect your account from unauthorized access, 
                and to contact you when necessary.</font></p>

                a voluntary basis, you may choose to share additional personal

                personal information you disclose in this way becomes public information 
                to the extent you choose to allow other users access to it. You 
                should exercise caution when deciding whether and what types of 
                information you wish to disclose. All such sharing of information 
                is done at your own risk. We collect and retain this personal 
                information or profile data so that you can utilize the unique 
                personalized features of the Entrecard Sites. We may also use such

                the services and resources provided on the Site, to track the 
                demographics of our users and to collaborate with partners and
