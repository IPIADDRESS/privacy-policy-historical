<p>With your consent, we will access location-based information, such as zip code, postal code, city, metropolitan area or geographic region from your mobile device. We will use this information to provide you with notifications related to our locations, return information, local offers or other information that we think will be helpful in providing you with better services.

<p><b style="">Vehicle Data</b><br>
</p>
<p>Our vehicles may be equipped with technology that collects and transmits data ("Vehicle Data Systems").&nbsp; This may include information collected from event data recorders, global positioning devices, OnStar systems or any other similar technology.&nbsp; Some or all Vehicle Data Systems functionality will be active during rental periods. When installed and where permissible, Vehicle Data Systems will enable us to collect and use information such as (1) location information, (2) collision information, and (3) vehicle operation information, such as operational condition, mileage, tyre pressure and fuel status, and other diagnostic and performance information. Once collected, this information may be combined with information you have provided to us and used to generate safety, performance and other similar information so that we can deliver better services.&nbsp; Our use of information collected from the vehicle may include sharing information with third parties such as service providers, partners, and as otherwise explained in this privacy policy.&nbsp; Our use of the information may also include storage of this information after the expiry of the rental agreement. Your use of the Vehicle Data Systems made available to you is subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policy posted by the applicable Vehicle Data Systems provider and/or vehicle manufacturer (in the case of OnStar, information is available at www.onstar.com), which may include system and service limitations, warranty exclusions, limitations of liability, wireless service provider terms, privacy practices, descriptions of use and sharing of information and user responsibilities. See a list of manufacturers from which we purchase vehicles on the Vehicle Manufacturers page.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for any data that is left in the vehicle as a result of your use. We cannot guarantee the privacy or confidentiality of such information and you must wipe it before you return the vehicle to us.</p>
<p>In the European Union, our vehicles are required to be equipped with eCall technology, which is activated if your vehicle is involved in an accident. eCall will automatically call and provide information regarding the accident to emergency services. We will also use, disclose and have access to this information.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Telematics Data will be shared with emergency service providers, others who assist in responding to an accident, telematics service operators or those with whom we have a legal or contractual obligation to provide such data.</p>

    <p>We use the information we collect from you or about you to provide you with our services and for the following purposes:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Where it is necessary for us to enter into a contract with you and provide services to you for the duration of the contract, including</b><ul>
<li>To assist the transactions that you request, such as reserving, renting, purchasing or leasing motor vehicles.</li>
<li>To provide customer service related to your interactions with us or to respond to your enquiry.</li>
<li>To enrol you in our loyalty programmes and send non-promotional information relating to your ongoing membership of these programmes.</li>

<li>To share information about your vehicle's location with emergency services in the event that you are involved in a road accident.</li>
<li>To share information with government and regulatory authorities when required by law or in response to legal process, obligation or request.</li>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests, as listed below, and where our interests are not overridden by your data protection rights, including</b><ul>
<li>To communicate important information about your rental. These communications, which are transactional in nature, will be sent to you via email, SMS or calls.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To assist us in providing better products and services: for example, to evaluate the performance of our staff, to assess the quality of products and services received and to help us improve our websites, facilities and services.</li>
<li>To compile statistics and analysis about our customers' use of our websites, products and services. These statistics are used only to enable us to provide better customer service, products, features and functionality to you and other customers in the future.</li>
<li>To develop a profile of you and your interactions with us so that we can provide tailored offers, opportunities and services that may be of interest to you.</li>
<li>To protect our legal rights and manage the security of our networks and property, including to protect our websites from spam and abuse. For example, we will use CCTV to ensure the security of our premises and we maintain Do Not Rent lists of customers who are non-payment or safety risks.</li>
<li>To share your information with third parties in order to prevent fraud and protect our business interests and rights, privacy, safety and property or that of the public. We will do this to collect unpaid bills, to avoid liability for penalties you incur (e.g. fixed penalty notices for driving offences) and for claims processing purposes.</li>
<li>To share your information with third parties in order to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit damage that we may sustain and to enforce the terms of any rental agreement or our websites' terms and conditions. We will also disclose your information to third parties if the rights of another individual may be violated.</li>
<li>To enable us to use vehicle data systems for purposes listed in the Vehicle Data section above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Where you have given consent, including</b><ul>
<li>To assist us in providing you with the most appropriate vehicles, such as those with adaptive driving devices. In some cases, this will require us to infer or explicitly collect information about your health or physical condition.</li>
<li>To send you certain promotional or targeted marketing communications, opportunities and services that may be of interest to you. These will include invitations to join our loyalty programmes, upgrade announcements, electronic newsletters and communications regarding an incomplete online membership form or reservation. Some of these offers will be received in advertising on non-Enterprise sites, including on social media.</li>
<li>To send you text messages in order to provide you with time-sensitive communications related to your transaction (e.g. construction delay at airport branch), extended rental opportunities, customer experience surveys, marketing promotions such as coupons, discounts, last-minute specials or loyalty and rewards information.</li>

<li><b>Rental transactions</b>: We keep the data associated to your rental agreement for up to seven&nbsp;years from the date of the rental, subject to other local legal requirements. We keep records of payments that you have made for two&nbsp;years from the date of the transaction (depending on the location of the rental).</li>
<li><b>Customer service related queries</b>:<b>&nbsp;</b>We keep general queries for three&nbsp;years, unless you make a complaint, in which case, we keep complaints data for seven&nbsp;years.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Disputes &amp; law enforcement</b>: If we are involved in litigation or a governmental or regulatory investigation, we keep data throughout the period of litigation or investigation and for five&nbsp;years thereafter.&nbsp;If a settlement means that we have to keep data for longer, we keep data for the period required to administer the settlement. If we provide data to law enforcement agencies, we keep a record of this for one&nbsp;year beyond the end of the investigation.</p>
