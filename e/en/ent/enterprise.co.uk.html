<strong>WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED</strong>
<ul>
<li><b>PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></li>
</ul>
<p>As a general rule, you will not be required to provide personally identifiable information as a condition of browsing this Web sites or Mobile sites. We attempt to collect the minimum amount necessary to facilitate transactions with you, to improve our Web sites or our Mobile sites and your customer experience and to make future visits to these Web sites and Mobile sites easier and more personalized for you.

<ul>

<p>We access location based information from your mobile device while searching for an Enterprise location in the area in which you have expressed interest.  We do not use this information to specifically locate you for any reason other than to provide you the service.  If you do not wish to allow us to use your location information then please do not use the service. If you have allowed us to utilize your location information in the past and wish to revoke the permissions to do so please turn off location services at the device level. Failing to provide requested information will not inhibit your ability to browse the Web site or Mobile site, but it may prevent you from being able to complete certain transactions or receive certain services from us.</p>

<p>In certain areas of our Sites, we provide you the ability to enter your friend’s name and email address in order for Enterprise to send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the sites.  Enterprise stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.</p>


<ul>
	<li><b>NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></li>
</ul>

<p>As part of the standard operation of our Web site, certain non-personal, anonymous information may be automatically provided to our Web servers by your computer. For each visitor to our Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes the visitor’s domain name or IP address (where possible), but not the visitor’s email address. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. As part of the protocol of the Internet, Web servers can identify your computer by its IP address. In addition, we may collect your browser type and operating system. Except as otherwise explained in this policy, we may combine the non-personal information we collect from you (as described above and as described below, under “Cookies &amp; Pixel Tracking”) with your personal information.</p>

<p>We also collect mobile device brand and model, mobile operation system and carrier to determine whether users view our .com or mobile version of the sites.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>COOKIES &amp; PIXEL TRACKING</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Cookies are short strings of text sent from a Web server to a Web browser when the browser accesses a Web site or Mobile site. Cookies may be “session-only” or “persistent.” Persistent cookies last for more than one visit and are typically used to allow a visitor to our Web site or Mobile site to personalize their experience.</p>

<p>By adjusting the settings in your browser, you can refuse to accept cookies or give yourself the opportunity to accept or reject cookies, or receive notice of cookies. Refusing cookies may impinge or block altogether your user experience by eliminating personalization or other features.</p>

<p>We may use cookies to analyze the traffic on our Web site or Mobile site (such as total visitors and pages viewed), to personalize features and content, to optimize our search engine marketing, to save you the trouble of retyping your name or other information when you come back to our Web site, and to make improvements to the Web site and Mobile site based on the data we collect. We do not save passwords or other sensitive information in cookies.</p>

<p>We may also use pixel tags (also known as “clear gifs,” “Web beacons” or “1-by-1gifs”) on our Web site and in our advertisements. We may work with our Affiliates (companies related to us) and our service providers to help us track, collect and analyze this information. Pixel tags may be used to collect a variety of information about your visit to our Web site, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click and other actions you take, all of which may be combined with other information we have collected from you. We use this information to enhance the effectiveness of our Web site, to compile aggregate usage statistics, to determine if errors are being encountered on the Web site and for other internal business purposes. <u>Not all of our sites have these capabilities, but we provide you the following choices as to whether or not you wish to have your data used for these purposes:</u></p>

<ul>
	<li>To opt-out of this feature when using our rental sites, please <a class="popup" href="http://www.enterprise.com/about/privacyPopUp_uk_en.html" target="_blank">click here</a>. An opt-out cookie will be set, blocking our analytics service provider from collecting your data.</li>
	<li>To opt-out of this feature for our other business units, please <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">click here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cookies may also be placed by third parties during your visit to the Web site and Mobile site. Our Affiliates and business partners (including our advertisers) may use these cookies in connection with their use of pixel tags for online preference marketing purposes (discussed below) or to assist us with some of the previously described functions. We do not control these cookies.</p>

<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These companies employ cookie and pixel tag technology to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients. These companies do not collect personally identifying information. These third-party advertising companies may use this anonymous information about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide ads about goods and services of interest to you, and for online preference marketing purposes. If you would like more information about this practice, and to know your choice about not having this information used by these companies, please <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices">click here</a>.  Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

<strong>HOW COLLECTED INFORMATION IS USED</strong>
<p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To assist you with reserving, renting, purchasing and leasing motor vehicles.</li>
<li>To provide information concerning car sales, ride-sharing and fleet services.</li>
<li>To conduct other transactions that you request.</li>
<li>To service your account or membership with us, respond to your questions and contact you when necessary.</li>
<li>To provide you with discounts, coupons, offers and other information and opportunities and services that may be of interest to you.</li>
<li>To assist us in providing better products and services (for example, we may contact you by telephone, mail or email to assist us in evaluating the performance of our staff, to assess the quality of product and service received and to help us improve our Web site, facilities and services).</li>
<li>To compile statistics and analysis about our customers’ use of our Web site, products and services, which statistics are only used to enable us to provide better customer service, products, features and functionality to you and other customers in the future.</li>
<li>To help us to operate, maintain and improve our systems and Web site and Mobile sites.</li>
<li>To allow you to modify or cancel a reservation.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may combine the information that you submit to us with information related to your transactions with us, such as rental location and vehicle type, as well as with information we receive about you from credit reporting agencies and other data providers who assist us in processing requests, maintaining our data and optimizing our services.  This Privacy Policy applies only to data collected on-line. If the same information about you is gathered from this Web site or Mobile site and also from other sources with different privacy policies, Enterprise may elect, in its sole discretion, to treat such information in accordance with the privacy policy that least restricts our use and disclosure of such information.</p>

<p>We attempt to retain information we collect for commercially reasonable periods of time or in accordance with specific policies or as required by law. Information collected for a specified purpose will only be used for that purpose and, after a reasonable period of time, will no longer be actively stored when that purpose has been fulfilled. Inactive data may, however, continue to be used for statistical, marketing, archiving, and other analytical purposes.</p>

<p><strong><u>PLEASE BE AWARE THAT, UNLESS PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOUR USE AND/OR CONTINUED USE OF THIS WEB SITE OR MOBILE SITE SIGNIFIES YOUR EXPRESS CONSENT THAT INFORMATION MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO OR STORED ON SERVERS AND PROCESSED OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY OF YOUR RESIDENCE, INCLUDING, THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED KINGDOM, IRELAND, GERMANY, AND CANADA. PLEASE ALSO BE AWARE THAT THE PRIVACY LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE INFORMATION MAY BE STORED MAY NOT BE AS COMPREHENSIVE OR OFFER AS MUCH PROTECTION AS THE LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>WITH WHOM THE INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED</strong><br><br>

</p><p>We may disclose the information we collect from and about you to our subsidiaries and affiliates for the purpose of providing the services you have requested and for marketing purposes. To update your marketing preferences please see the “CORRECTING OR CHANGING YOUR INFORMATION/CONTACTING ENTERPRISE” section below.  We also may disclose this information to third parties: (1) when we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, customers or other users of our Web sites or Mobile sites, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities; (2) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process; (3) to our Affiliates, business partners and/or third parties, subject to confidentiality agreements as appropriate, for administrative, technical support or other business purposes as necessary to facilitate our transactions with you, analyze our data, conduct mobile analytics services, or to maintain and improve our services; and (4) to our subsidiaries, affiliates or licensee/franchisee located in the country in which you place your reservation in order to process your car-hire transaction. We may disclose your personal information to third-party service providers including a payment processor to bill you for goods or services, an email provider to send email communications to you on our behalf and the provider of our live chat feature in order to offer you customer service.  These service providers may be located in a country different from your country of residence, such as the United States or European Union member country. These service providers are contractually required to maintain the confidentiality and security of your information. However, your information may be accessible to U.S. or EU authorities in accordance with applicable laws.</p>

<p>Enterprise or its Affiliates may sell or buy other businesses or entities. In such transactions, personal information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that Enterprise or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your personal information may be one of the transferred assets. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our Web site or Mobile sites for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>

<p>We may also share aggregated information about our customers with our advertisers and marketing partners. This information does not include any personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><strong>Except as explained above, we will not share any of your personal information with any third party, unless we have received your express permission to do so.</strong></p>

<p>With your prior notice and consent, we may share your name and email address with our co-branded partners and affiliates in order to provide the services you have requested and for marketing purposes.  If you wish to stop receiving promotional communications from these third parties, please review the “CHOICES YOU CAN MAKE ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION” section below.</p>

<p><strong>TESTIMONIALS</strong></p>

<p>We may post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our web sites which may contain personally identifiable information.  We will obtain your consent via email prior to posting the testimonial.  To request the removal of your testimonial, please contact us through one of the methods listed below.</p>

<p><strong>LINKED SITES</strong></p>

<p>Our Web site may contain links to other Web sites (such as those of our marketing partners or advertisers), which may have privacy policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the activities and practices that take place on these Web sites. Accordingly, we recommend that you review the privacy policy posted on any Web site that you may access through our Web site.</p>

<p><strong>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</strong></p>

<p>This Web site is not directed to, and Enterprise does not knowingly collect personal information from, children under the age of 13. We recommend that parents actively participate in their children’s use of the Internet.</p>

<p><strong>CHOICES YOU CAN MAKE ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>We give you a number of choices about the collection, use and distribution of your information. For example, you must affirmatively request to receive email advertisements from us, our Affiliates and/or business partners concerning information about special offers, promotions and new features, products and services. Every Enterprise email advertisement will provide you with the opportunity to remove yourself from our email list. You may choose to opt back in to our email advertisements at anytime, in which your most recent action will prevail. We will give you an opportunity to opt-out of the gathering of your personally identifiable information, specific uses of your personally identifiable information and any marketing promotions in accordance with the procedures set out in the section below, "<strong>Correcting or Changing Your Information</strong>."</p>

<p>To opt out of receiving further promotional communications from our third party co-branded partners and affiliates, please contact them directly.</p>

<p><strong>CORRECTING OR CHANGING YOUR INFORMATION/CONTACTING ENTERPRISE</strong></p>

<p>We are very concerned about the accuracy, currency and completeness of the information we collect and make efforts we deem appropriate to ensure that the information we have is accurate and up-to-date. In addition to the options provided to you in this policy, if you wish to review, amend, correct, update or delete personally identifiable information we have collected about you online contact us at the information provided below. Please also contact us if you have any questions about privacy on our Web site or Mobile site. You may contact us via email at <a href="customerservice@erac.com" target="_blank">customerservice@erac.com</a>, and we will attend to your request and make any necessary revisions. If you prefer, country specific contact information is listed below. We will respond to your access request within 30 days.</p>

<p>We reserve the right not to allow access to your information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is prohibited by law or if the rights of another individual might be violated.</p>

<p><strong>SECURITY PROCEDURES</strong></p>

<p>We are very concerned with the security of your personally identifiable information and try to provide secure transmission of your information from your PC or Mobile Device to our servers. For certain transactions on certain of our Web sites, we may use Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to secure the transfer of information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted over the Internet. Once we receive your information, we take steps that we believe are reasonably appropriate to protect its security, both internally and from outsiders, from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, and to ensure the integrity of the data we collect. We use a combination of technological, physical, administrative and policy methods as well as organizational controls and non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements as we deem appropriate to protect this data.</p>

<p>If you have a user name and password for any of the features on our Web site, you have the responsibility of keeping your password secret. You should not reveal your password to anyone. We will not ask you in an unsolicited telephone call or email for your password. In addition, you should take reasonable precautions when using a computer that is not your own or in a public setting.</p>

<p><strong>CHANGES IN TERMS</strong></p>

<p>We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the email address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>

<p><strong>SAFE HARBOR</strong></p>

<p>Enterprise Holdings complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
