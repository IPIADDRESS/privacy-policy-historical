<p>Effective date Fourteenth of December 2005 (14/12/2005 - UK date format)</p>

<p>The EntroPay service is offered by:
<br>Ixaris Systems Ltd ("the Company"), Registered in England 4072405
<br>Registered office: 2 Sheraton Street, London W1F 8BH</p>

<h4>Data Protection</h4>

<p>Any information you provide us with will only be disclosed 
in accordance with the Data Protection Act of 1998. </p>

<h4>Collection of Personal Information</h4>

<p>To open your EntroPay account, we must obtain certain personal information, 
such as name, address, email or phone number as well as demographic information 
like age. You should ensure the email address you have registered with us is 
always correct, so that we can always contact you with important information 
regarding your account. For certain optional transactions, we also collect 
selected financial information such as credit card details. For transaction 
volumes over a certain limit, we are legally required to report some personally 
identifiable information to the authorities. For verification purposes we 
reserve the right to request proof of identification in an offline format. 
Your IP address and access times may be tracked against your user id for the 
dual purposes of preventing fraud and creating an audit trail when using the 
EntroPay service.</p>

<h4>Use of Personal Information</h4>

<p>We only use your personal information to service your account and to improve 
our services to you. However, we do share some financial information as part of 
normal business operations with banks or credit card processing and verification 
services. These entities may not use your information for secondary purposes, 
unless required by law. Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy we 
may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have 
a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial 
proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our web site. In the event 
of a sale of the Company or its assets, your Personal Information may be disclosed 
to the purchaser of the Company or its assets, solely for the purposes of 
continuation of the EntroPay service, or similar. Otherwise we will only disclose 
your information to a third-party with your EXPLICIT permission.</p>

<h4>Suspicion of Money Laundering, Fraud or Other Illegal Activity</h4>

<p>To ensure that EntroPay is not used for Money Laundering, Fraud or Other Illegal 
Activity, we may monitor user behaviour and transactions.  Where we suspect such 
activity we will not normally tell the user of our suspicions.   We will also 
report to the competent authorities, normally without prior or subsequent notice 
to the user, any information on the user relating to actual or suspected money 
laundering, fraud and other illegal activity where we are required by law to do so.</p>

<h4>Control of Personal Information</h4>

<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your phone, 
email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide 
a way to correct and update that user's personally identifiable information, as 
provided to us. This can be done via our website, or as a last resort by 
e-mailing us on <a href="mailto:support@entropay.com">support@entropay.com</a>. 
In order to deactivate your account you will need to contact our support team 
via the website or via <a href="mailto:support@entropay.com">support@entropay.com</a>. 
However, please understand we cannot completely delete user information because of 
legal/regulatory and technical back up requirements.</p>

<h4>Communication</h4>

<p>Upon registration every user will receive an email confirming his successful 
registration. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, 
services and special deals via newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our 
users we present the option to not receive these types of communications and this 
choice can be made at the time of registration. Should the user wish to change 
their choice after registration they can e-mail 
<a href="mailto:support@entropay.com">support@entropay.com</a>.
