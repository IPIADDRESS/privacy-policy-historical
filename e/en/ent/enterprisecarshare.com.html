</ul><p>As part of the standard operation of our Web site, certain information may be automatically provided to our Web servers by your computer. For each visitor to our Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes the visitor’s domain name or IP address (where possible), but not the visitor’s email address. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. As part of the protocol of the Internet, Web servers can identify your computer by its IP address. In addition, we may collect your browser type and operating system. Except as otherwise explained in this policy, we may combine the automated information we collect from you (as described above and as described below, under “Cookies &amp; Pixel Tracking”) with your personal information in order to tailor our website and enhance your online experience by saving your preferences and/or to help identify site features, advertisements and offers that may be of interest to you.</p>
<ul><li><strong>COOKIES &amp; PIXEL TRACKING</strong></li>
</ul><p>Cookies are short strings of text sent from a Web server to a Web browser when the browser accesses a Web site.

We may work with our Affiliates (companies related to us) and our service providers to help us track, collect and analyze this information. Pixel tags may be used to collect a variety of information about your visit to our Web site, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click and other actions you take.&nbsp;Not all of our sites have these capabilities, but we provide you the following choices as to whether or not you wish to have your data used for these purposes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>To opt-out of this feature when using our rental sites, please&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coremetrics.com/company/privacy.php#optout">click here</a>. An opt-out cookie will be set, blocking our analytics service provider from collecting your data.&nbsp;</li>
