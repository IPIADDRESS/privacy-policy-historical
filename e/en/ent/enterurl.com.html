                <strong class="text_bold">Summary</strong><br>
                <br>
EnterURL.com Values and respects the privacy of the Company's Customers           and visitors. This statement discloses the information practices for the <a href="http://www.enterurl.com" target="_blank">EnterURL.com</a> and affiliated websites, including what type of information is gathered           and tracked, how the information is used, how to correct or change it           and with whom the information is shared. These privacy practices apply           only to online transactions, activity and to all email communications. <strong>EnterURL.com will not sell your email address to anyone without your           express permission and we control all email delivery to assure your privacy.</strong> When we do share information with our partners and advertisers, it is           in aggregate form, and does not identify you personally. EnterURL.com           does not use any information about you except for the information that           you provide or is publicly available, and this information is used solely           to make the EnterURL services ("Services") provided more relevant           to your interests. <strong>Under no circumstances is your e-mail address ever           shared with advertisers.</strong> By becoming an EnterURL.com Customer, you           agree to the EnterURL.com Services Agreement Terms and Conditions.<br>
<br>
<strong>1. What Personally Identifiable Information Does EnterURL Collect?</strong> <br>
In general, you can visit EnterURL.com on the Web without telling us who           you are and without revealing any information about yourself. There are           times, however, when we, or our Service partners, may need information           from you in order to provide the requested Services. EnterURL’s primary           goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best           and most useful Services. EnterURL collects personally identifiable information           when a Customer provides it to us, such as when you subscribe to Services,           complete a survey, update your profile on our Web site, use certain Services,           respond to our emails, and when you visit the EnterURL Web sites. EnterURL           may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to           the information you have provided to us. EnterURL has implemented appropriate           technical and organizational measures, such as using encryption for transmission           of credit card numbers, to help us keep your information secure, accurate,           current, and complete. We will respond in a timely manner to your requests           to correct inaccuracies in your personal information.<br>
<br>
<strong>2. What Anonymous Information Does EnterURL Collect?</strong><br>
We collect anonymous information from visits to our sites to help us provide           better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from           which people visit and we also measure visitor activity on EnterURL.com           and affiliated websites, but we do so in ways that keep the information           anonymous. <br>
<br>
Also, when we collect personal data from you in connection with a transaction           we may extract some information about that transaction in an anonymous           format and combine it with other anonymous information. This anonymous           information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us           understand trends and patterns. If you do not want your transaction details           used in this manner, you can either disable your cookies or opt-out of           the Services and discontinue visits to the EnterURL and affiliates Web           sites.<br>
<br>
We collect the anonymous information we mentioned in the previous   paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including "cookies".   A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser,   which may then be stored on your system. Some EnterURL.com pages use   cookies, sent by EnterURL.com or its third party service partners, or   other technologies to better serve you when you return to the site. You   can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving   you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your   browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some areas of some   EnterURL web sites may not function properly. <br>
<br>
To track general Customer traffic patterns, we use electronic images   known as single-pixel GIFs, transparent GIFs, or clear gifs.   EnterURL.com also automatically receives and records information from   our servers and from your browser including your IP address, the time,   and information about the page you requested. In order to determine   which features Customers find most useful, we use tracking technologies   in a variety of ways, including: keeping count of return visits to our   site or our advertisers' or partners' sites and accumulating and   reporting anonymous, aggregate, statistical information on Web site and   advertisement usage. <br>
<br>
EnterURL.com has certain companies help deliver ads and other online   communications. These companies may collect and use information about   customers to help us better understand the offers, promotions, and types   of advertising that are most appealing to our customers. The   information they collect is aggregated so it is not identifiable to a   specific individual.<br>
<br>
