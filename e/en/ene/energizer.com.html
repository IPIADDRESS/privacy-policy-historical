<b>Sharing</b><br>
At times, we may be working with third party companies to execute a specific promotion or program. If the information is to be shared with any third-party for the purposes of executing a specific promotion or program, the details will be clearly communicated in the program's rules for the specific program or promotion, and the third-party will have no right to use the information for independent purposes. When a user signs up for these services, he or she will have to opt-in to permit Eveready to share names or other contact information necessary for the third-party to provide these services. These third-parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information, except for the purpose of providing these services. In support of this policy, Energizer will enter into written agreements with all third parties to ensure that they will meet privacy standards, including the privacy standards of COPPA and the U.S. Commerce Department Safe Harbor provisions.<br>

<br>
<b>Choice/Opt-in</b><br>
