			in this Privacy Statement and solely for the purpose of recruitment services to you. By providing personal information to us you consent
			to its collection, use and transfer in accordance with this privacy statement and in accordance with our website terms of use.</p>

			potential coming job opportunity. You will not be contacted for any purpose other than recruitment. We will not send you unsolicited
			commercial communications or contact you for direct marketing purposes. We may periodically send you updates via email to alert

			Typically recruitment fraud takes the form of an email sent to an individual and purporting to come from, or sent on behalf of the employer
			or potentially purporting to come from, or sent on behalf of a recruitment or staffing agency (like Energy Placement) who act for their client
			the prospective employer. In addition to asking for money or a payment, these individuals/entities may request sensitive personal
			information such as personal financial account details, immigration, visa or passport documents, birth certificate, social security number
			or national identity numbers, credit card numbers etc. This may be via a bogus application form or otherwise.</p>
