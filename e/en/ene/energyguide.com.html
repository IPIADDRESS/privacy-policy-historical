<h4>Our Commitment to Privacy</h4>

ENERGYguide.com has created this privacy statement 
in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of our customers and 
the information that they provide us. ENERGYguide.com collects and processes 
information for specified legitimate purposes either directly on the 
ENERGYguide.com site or through a co-branded partner site (see Co-Branded 
Partner below). Neither we, nor our co-branded partners, will give away, trade, 
sell or release any information obtained from our customers. The following 
headings address how ENERGYguide.com and our co-branded partners gather and use 
information. 
<p></p>

<h4>IP Addresses and Cookies</h4>

ENERGYguide.com collects the user's IP address and any referring URL. The user's 
IP address is often not an address that can be traced to their machine, as most 
users do not employ static IP addresses. Rather, they connect through an ISP, a 
service that uses DHCP or a proxy server. In these cases, their IP address is 
not permanently bound to their machine. We use the IP address to help diagnose 
problems with our server and to administer ENERGYguide.com. IP addresses are 
also used in aggregate form for traffic analysis.
<p></p> 
 
<p>When a person visits the site, a cookie is created on the user's machine that 
stores that visitor's ENERGYguide.com user ID. The cookie is non-sessional and 
persists on the user's machine for one year at which point it expires. A second 
cookie is also created to hold session information. It expires as soon as the 
session terminates (after twenty minutes). ENERGYguide.com also utilizes cookies 
to track items placed in your shopping cart, deliver content specific to your 
interests and save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you 
visit our site (See also the Advertising section regarding 3rd party use of 
cookies on our site) . 
</p>
 

<h4>Registration Information</h4>
ENERGYguide.com's registration form requires users to provide contact 
information including at a minimum, name, ZIP code and email address. We use 
customer contact information from the registration form to send users 
information about our company. Users may opt-out of receiving such information. 
(see the choice/opt-out section below). <br><br>ENERGYguide.com also asks for 
email address and ZIP code in order to contact the member and provide them with 
updates on savings and energy information. Users may opt-out of receiving future 
mailings (see the choice/opt-out section below). <br>

<h4>Order Information</h4>

ENERGYguide.com uses an order form for customers to request and purchase 
information, products and services. We collect visitor's contact information 
(like their email address) and financial information (like their account or 
credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send 
orders to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to 
contact members with special offers, site information, surveys to track their 
site experience and notifications of any site performance issues. Users may 
opt-out of receiving these mailings (see the choice/opt-out section below). 
Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products 
and services they purchase. <br><br>In some cases we allow the user to signup 
directly on the Merchant or Content Partner. In this case we may ask for the 
user's contact information (like name, ZIP code and email address) and pass this 
over to the Partner. However, this information is only used for the primary 
purpose for which it was collected. <br><br>In other cases ENERGYguide.com 
collects all signup info and retains it. In these cases information is either 
transmitted on a real-time basis or batched and sent to the Merchant or Content 
Partner on a daily basis. <br><br>In all instances of Order Information, 
ENERGYguide.com employs multiple security methods to protect the information 
<br>
<h4>Analysis Information</h4>

provided by visitor from the various tools, calculators and other analytical

only so that we may personalize the site for our members and to communicate

analyze user data and understand appropriate products and services for our 
users. Users will receive energy-savings information and other related mailings 
unless they have no interest in receiving such notifications and opt out (see 
the choice/opt-out section below). <br><br>


<h4>Contest Information</h4>

From time to time, ENERGYguide.com may promote contests in which we ask visitors 
for contact information (like their email address). Contact data from our 
contests are used to send users information about our company. We also utilize 
contact data, such as email address, to notify the contest winners. Users may 
opt-out of receiving future notifications on our contests (see the 
choice/opt-out section below). <br>
