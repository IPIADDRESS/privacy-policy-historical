<h2>E2E NETWORKS PRIVACY STATEMENT</h2>
<p>E2E Networks Private Limited (“E2E,” “our,” “we” or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of the personal information it collects.</p>
<p>Our personal information handling practices are described below, in any applicable privacy supplements, and in notices at the point of data collection.</p>
<p>We urge you to read this Privacy Statement so that you understand our commitment to you and your privacy, and how you can participate in that commitment. If you have any questions, please contact us at<br>
<a href="abuse@e2enetworks.com">abuse@e2enetworks.com</a>.</p>
<h4>SCOPE and YOUR CONSENT TO OUR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
<p>This Privacy Statement applies to personal information and other information collected by E2E or its service providers from or about: (i) visitors to, or users of, its websites (“E2E Websites”); (ii) prospective and current customers using E2E hosting and information technology services (the “Services”); (iii) service providers and business partners; (iv) job applicants; and (v) other third-parties that it interacts with.</p>
<p>By providing your personal information to E2E in the ways described in this Privacy Statement, you:</p>
<ul>
<li>agree that you are authorized to provide that information;</li>
<li>are accepting this Privacy Statement and any supplementary privacy statement that may be relevant to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not agree to our practices, please do not register, subscribe, create an account, or otherwise interact with our Services or E2E Websites.</p>
<h4>1. WHAT INFORMATION DOES E2E COLLECT AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE IS IT USED?</h4>
<p>When we refer to “Personal Information”, we mean any information that can identify you. It includes information or an opinion from which you are reasonably identifiable. In some jurisdictions, Personal Information includes information that identifies a legal entity, such as company name. We describe the Personal Information that we collect in more detail below.</p>
<p>We may also collect information that is related to you but that does not personally identify you (“Non-personal Information”). Non-personal Information also includes information that could personally identify you in its original form, but that we have modified (for instance, by aggregating, anonymizing or de-identifying such information) in order to remove or hide any Personal Information.</p>
<h4>WHEN WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Information you give us or our service providers.</b> You may provide Personal Information when you: (i) access E2E Websites, (ii) request, purchase and use the Services, (iii) communicate with E2E via phone calls, chat, email, web forms, social media and other methods of communication, (iv) subscribe to E2E marketing material, (v) apply for a job, or (vi) provide services to E2E.</li>
<li><b>Information we collect about you and your device via automated means.</b> Each time you visit an E2E Website, view an E2E advertisement on a third party-owned website or read an E2E marketing email, we may automatically collect information about you via cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies.
<ul>
<li><b>Email communication.</b> We use pixel tags and cookies in our marketing emails so that we can track your interaction with those messages, such as when you open the email or click a URL link that’s embedded within them. When recipients click on one of those URLs, they pass through a<br>
separate web server before arriving at the destination page on an E2E Website. We use tools like pixel tags and cookies so that we can determine interest in particular topics and measure and improve the effectiveness of our communications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Information we receive from other sources.</b> We work closely with third parties (for example, business partners, service providers, sub-contractors, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies, fraud protection services, channel partners and resellers) and may receive information about you from them.
<ul>
<li><b>Social Media Platforms.</b> We may receive certain information that’s stored or processed by third parties, such as the social media sites Facebook®, Twitter® and LinkedIn® when you interact with us through these social media platforms. E2E Websites may include social media features – such as the Facebook “Like” button – and widgets – such as the “share this” button. These features may collect your IP address as well as details of the pages you are visiting on E2E Websites. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or<br>
hosted by E2E Websites. Each social media platform may have a privacy statement that specifically governs its use of social media features.</li>
<li><b>Public Forums, Blogs and the Customer Reference Program.</b> E2E Websites may feature bulletin boards, blogs or forums. Any Personal Information that you choose to submit via such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. E2E posts a list of customers and testimonials on E2E Websites. These lists and testimonials usually contain Personal Information such as customer names and job titles. E2E obtains the consent of each customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials.</li>
<li><b>Co-branding.</b> Some E2E Websites or Services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you use such website or Services, both E2E and the other company may receive the Personal Information that’s collected via that co-branded website or Service. The company whose privacy statement is displayed on a co-branded website will be responsible for Personal Information collected on such a website.</li>
<li><b>Third-party vendors.</b> In order to provide the Services and improve E2E Websites, E2E may engage the services of third-party vendors. In the process of supplying services to E2E, these third-party vendors may need to collect Personal Information about you. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>THE TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Contact Information</b> includes your name, company name, job title, telephone numbers, fax numbers, postal addresses, email addresses, or other addresses at which you receive communications from or on behalf of E2E (“Contact Information”). When you are expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services or signing up to use the Services, E2E requires that you provide contact information (“Required Contact Information”).</li>
<li><b>Transactional Information</b> includes information about the Services you use, and how you interact with us and the Services (for example through email, customer portal, or phone).</li>
<li><b>Billing Information</b> includes financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, and a credit card number, including card security number and credit card date of expiration.</li>
<li><b>Optional Information</b> includes your company’s annual revenues, number of employees, industry or similar information that helps us tailor our Services to you. Please note, that Optional Information is information that you do not have to provide unless otherwise agreed between us.</li>
<li><b>Information Collected by Automated Means</b> includes information that E2E collects through commonly used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and web beacons. Such information includes standard information from your web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and your activities on E2E Websites (such as the web pages viewed and the links clicked, number of visits, access time, device ID or other unique identifier, domain name, screen views, language information, device name and model, and operating system type), the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave E2E Websites, your computer operating system, and mobile device operating system (if you are accessing E2E Websites using a mobile device). <br><br>
Information Collected by Automated Means also includes information that we may collect about: your use of certain Service features; the functionality of the Services; when you click on ads; your participation in research initiatives like surveys about our Services.<p></p>
<p>While E2E does not monitor or view the specific data stored by its customers who are using the Services, it is necessary for E2E to track various parameters of transferred data (file size, etc.) to support features including, but not limited to, bandwidth monitoring and storage usage. E2E treats such information as Non-personal Information and in accordance with its agreements it has in place with its customers.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><b>To enable third parties to provide services to us.</b> We may need to provide your Required Contact Information to third parties so that they may carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.Please see more section 2 below. We also engage third-parties to provide us with reports about the usage and browsing patterns of E2E Websites. Such third parties track and analyze such information with respect to visitors to E2E Websites.</li>
<li><b>We may also use your Personal Information in other ways as more particularly described in our terms of service or other agreements between us / your company.</b> Any Personal Information you provide when you sign up for the Services may be used by us as we describe in the applicable terms of service or agreements between us and as described in this Privacy Statement. To assist us with the uses described in this paragraph, the information that we or our service providers have collected from or about you (for example, through E2E Websites, or E2E e-mail<br>
communications with you) may be combined with or enhanced by other information about you that we have obtained from you or from other sources, including from our service providers or business partners.</li>
<li><b>To protect our business.</b> We use information we collect to prevent or detect fraud or abuses of the E2E Websites and the Services, and to identify and protect our business from fraudulent transactions.</li>
<li><b>To manage our everyday business needs,</b> such as to: administer and manage our business; train our employees; help promote compliance with our terms of service or any other agreements between us; allow you to apply for a job; carry out research and development; carry out other purposes that are disclosed to you and to which you consent; or to comply with the law.</li>

</ul>

<p>Except for the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Statement or your applicable agreement / terms of service, the Personal Information we gather is for internal use only and we will not authorize the release of this information to anyone outside of E2E unless you have consented to such disclosure. When we need to provide your Personal Information to third parties, we will only share it to the extent reasonably necessary. We may also share your Personal Information as required or permitted by law and as described below. </p>
<p>Please note that the parties to whom we send your Personal Information may be located in another country.

These third party service providers and channel partners are expected to maintain privacy and security protections that are consistent with E2E’s privacy and information security policies.</p>

<li><b>Disclosure to Others:</b> Should you breach any of our terms and conditions (for example, our terms of service or the E2E Website term) or if we are under a duty to disclose or share your Personal Information in order to comply with any legal or compliance obligation, we may disclose your information to a relevant authority. We may need to release the information we collect to third parties when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce our legal rights, to protect the rights, safety or property of our business and others, or to assist with industry efforts to control fraud, spam or other undesirable conduct and as needed to support auditing, compliance, and corporate governance functions.
<p>Additionally, we will provide information to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</p></li>
<li><b>Disclosure when we have your consent:</b> We may also disclose your Personal Information and other information, for any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information, as otherwise required or permitted by law, and/or with your consent. Any such purposes may involve the transfer of your Personal Information across country borders.

</ul>
