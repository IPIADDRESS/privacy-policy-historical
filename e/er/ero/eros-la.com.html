We also use your information to deliver customized services to you; for User support purposes; and for efforts to monitor and ensure against fraud, harassment and spamming.  Non-personal and aggregate information, which is – as stated above – collected passively, is used in order to geographically customize our marketing efforts or to generally customize the use of our site for an aggregate group of customers.  Information gathered from Potential Advertisers may be used to assist such individuals in completing the application/submission process, and for marketing and/or research purposes. </blockquote>
      <p><strong>VI.</strong> <strong>Special Cases.</strong>  </p>
       <blockquote>It is our policy not to use or share the passive information about Users in ways unrelated to those described in this Policy without also providing the User with an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, we may disclose passively-collected information about Users, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason without notice if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including, but not limited to: 
      <p>1.   To satisfy any laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental, or legal requests for such information; </p>
      <p>2.   To disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use and other policies and procedures; </p>
      <p>3.   To operate our Services properly; </p>
      <p>4.   To protect ourselves, our Users, and the general public.  We specifically reserve the right to disclose any and all information to law enforcement in the event that a crime – including, but not limited to, fraud-related offense – is committed, is suspected, or if we are compelled to do so by lawful criminal, civil, or administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, writs, or reasonable request of authorities or persons with the reasonable power to obtain such process; and</p>
      <p>5.   To cooperate with law enforcement authorities, and other governmental, administrative or regulatory agencies about our end users to the extent required by applicable law.  Examples of such cooperation include lawful criminal, civil, or administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, or writs.  We do not intend to cooperate with private-party litigants and others seeking information unless compelled to do so through lawful court or administrative process, such as subpoenas, court orders, or writs. </p></blockquote>
      <p><strong>VII.</strong>  <strong>Transmittals from Us.</strong></p>
      <blockquote>The Company does not presently intend to send promotional e-mails to Users, as there is no active collection of a User's email address. <strong> </strong>Notwithstanding, the Company specifically reserves the right to change this policy, and do so in the future, without prior notice.  The implementation of any changes to the preexisting practice will be reflected in the Site's Privacy Policy.  We strongly advise our Users to periodically review the terms of this policy in order to stay apprised of any such changes.  <p></p>
      <p>If you provide your information to us or use the Site, you will have created a commercial relationship with us.  Even though the Site presently opts not to provide Users, as described above, with e-mail advertising materials, your use of the Site and its services constitutes your understanding and consent that even unsolicited commercial email sent from us or our affiliates is not SPAM as that term is defined under the law.<strong><br clear="all">
      </strong>      </p></blockquote>
      <p><strong>VIII.</strong> <strong>Public Forums.</strong></p>
      <blockquote>At the time of the institution of this Policy, the Site does not offer any public forums or blogs to Users.  The Company reserves the right to offer public forum and blogging services in the future.  <p></p>
      <p><strong>IX.</strong> <strong>Our Commitment to Data Security.</strong>  </p>
      <p>We take measures, including data encryption, to protect the transmission of all sensitive end-user information.  We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems.  Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party 'hackers' from illegally obtaining this information.  We take all reasonable measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-criminals we are unable to guarantee that our security is 100% breach-proof.  You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite our reasonable security measures.</p>
      <p>Further, other than what is stated hereunder, we do not provide User information to third parties; nor will we sell, rent or provide any of your information to other entities such as advertisers, or other companies selling services similar to this Company's services.  </p></blockquote>
