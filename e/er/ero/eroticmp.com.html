		<p></p><h3 class="blue">II. Changes in this Privacy Statement.</h3> <p></p>

		If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so 
that you 
are aware 
of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

		<p></p><h3 class="blue">III. Personal Information That We Collect.</h3> <p></p>
		<blockquote>
			A. <b>Personal information:</b> When you sign up on our site you provide us with your user name, email, zip code, and location. Once you register 
you can visit your <a href="/mypage.htm">profile</a> at any time to change personal information about yourself. <br><br>

			B. <b>Content:</b> One of the primary reasons people use our site is to share content with others. Examples include when you leave a review, 
comment someone else's review, upload a picture, talk on the forums, or post classifieds ads. <br><br>

			C. <b>Transactional Information:</b> We may retain the details of transactions or payments such as credit card number, and 
billing address you make on us. However, we will only keep your 
payment source account number with your consent. We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or 
offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.<br><br>


			D. <b>Site activity information:</b> We keep track of the actions you take on the site, such as sending a message to someone, sending a file to 
someone. In some cases you are also taking an action when you provide information or content to us. For example, if you receive a sms message from us, in addition to 
storing the actual content you recieve, we might log the fact you process it. <br><br>

			E. <b>Access Device and Browser Information:</b> When you access the site from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect 
information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit.<br><br>

			F. <b>Cookie Information:</b> We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or 
other device) to make the site easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to protect both you and the site. For example, we use them to store your login ID (but 
never your password) to make it 
easier for you to login whenever you come back to the site. We also use them to confirm that you are logged into the site, and to know when you are interacting with 
the site. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use the site. We do link the information 
we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our 
<br><br>

			G. <b>Customer Testimonials/Comments/Reviews:</b> We post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our web site which may contain personally 
identifiable information.  We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.<br><br>

		</blockquote>
		<p></p><h3 class="blue">IV. How We Use Your Information.</h3> <p></p>
		<blockquote>

			A. <b>To manage the service:</b> We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those 
services and features, and to provide you with customer support. We use the information to prevent potentially illegal activities. We also use a variety of technological 
systems to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent 
abuse such as spam. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.<br><br>

			B. <b>contact you:</b> We may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time. You may opt out of all communications except 
essential updates on your <a href="http://www.eroticmp.com/mypage?p=es">account notifications page</a>. We may include content you see on the site in the emails we send 
to you.	<br><br>

			C. <b>To serve personalized advertising to you:</b> We don't share your information with advertisers without your consent. (An example of consent 
would 
be if you asked us to provide your shipping address to an advertiser to receive a free sample.) We allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see 
their advertisements and we may use any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected (including information you may have decided not to show to other 
users, such as your ethnicity preference or other sensitive personal information or preferences) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. For example, 
we might use your interest in asian people to show you ads posted by asian providers, but we do not tell the provider who you are.
Even though we do not share your information with advertisers without your consent, when you click on or otherwise interact with 
an advertisement there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they selected. <br><br>
		</blockquote>
		<p></p><h3 class="blue">V. Special Cases.</h3> <p></p>
		<blockquote>
			It is our policy not to use or share the passive information about 
			Users in ways unrelated to those described in this Policy without 
			also providing the User with an opportunity to opt out or otherwise 
			prohibit such unrelated uses. However, we may disclose 
			passively-collected information about Users, or information 
			regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through 
			our Services, for any reason without notice if, in our sole 
			discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including, 
			but not limited to: 
			<p>1. To satisfy any laws, such as the Electronic Communications 
			Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental, or legal requests for 
			such information; </p>
			<p>2. To disclose information that is necessary to identify, 
			contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating 
			our Terms of Use and other policies and procedures; </p>
			<p>3. To operate our Services properly; </p>
			<p>4. To protect ourselves, our Users, and the general public. We 
			specifically reserve the right to disclose any and all information 
			to law enforcement in the event that a crime including, but not 
			limited to, fraud-related offenses is committed, is suspected, or 
			if we are compelled to do so by lawful criminal, civil, or 
			administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, 
			writs, or reasonable request of authorities or persons with the 
			reasonable power to obtain such process; and ...</p>
			<p>5. To cooperate with law enforcement authorities, and other 
			governmental, administrative or regulatory agencies about our end 
			users to the extent required by applicable law. Examples of such 
			cooperation include lawful criminal, civil, or administrative 
			process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, or writs. We 
			do not intend to cooperate with private-party litigants and others 
			seeking information unless compelled to do so through lawful court 
			or administrative process, such as subpoenas, court orders, or 
			writs. </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p></p><h3 class="blue">VI. Transmittals from Us.</h3> <p></p>
		<blockquote>
			The Company does not presently intend to send promotional e-mails to 
			Users, as there is no active collection of a User's email address. 
			<p>If you provide your information to us or use the Site, you will 
			have created a commercial relationship with us. Even though the Site 
			presently opts not to provide Users, as described above, with e-mail 
			advertising materials, your use of the Site and its services 
			constitutes your understanding and consent that even unsolicited 
			commercial email sent from us or our affiliates is not SPAM as that 
			term is defined under the law.<strong><br clear="all">
&nbsp;</strong></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p></p><h3 class="blue">VII. Public Forums.</h3> <p></p>
		<blockquote>
			At the time of the institution of this Policy, the Site  
			offers a public forum for Users. The Company reserves the 
			right to offer other services, such as blogging in the future. <br><br>

			If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit 
there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally 
identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
		</blockquote>
	
		<p></p><h3 class="blue">VIII.Our Commitment to Data Security.</h3><p></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>We take measures, including data encryption, to protect the 
			transmission of all sensitive end-user information. We make every 
			effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and 
			systems. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that our security 
			measures will prevent third-party 'hackers' from illegally obtaining 
			this information. We take all reasonable measures to prevent such 
			breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of 
			cyber-criminals we are unable to guarantee that our security is 100% 
			breach-proof. You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent 
			that they occur despite our reasonable security measures. </p>
			<p><b><span style="font-size: 14px">We do not provide 
			User information to third parties. We will not sell, rent or provide 
			any of your information to other entities such as advertisers, or 
			other companies selling services similar to this Company's services.</span>
