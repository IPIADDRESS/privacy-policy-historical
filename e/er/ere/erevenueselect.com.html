NOTE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS (ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 2003

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2">It
is the intent of the Privacy Policy to comply with the California
Act.  Various provisions throughout this Privacy Policy address
requirements of the act.  In summary, you must presume that we
collect electronic information from all visitors.  This is not
usually personally identifiable.  If you purchase a product or
service via this website (and thereby become covered by the Act), the
purchase agreement you electronically sign prior to purchase allows
the website to collect and archive all the personal information you
provide and to transmit and/or transfer that personal information to
third parties.  There is no way you can modify this information and
you have no right to do so.  Under the terms of the purchase
agreement, you have no right to view or receive any information about
our database.  In the event that the website, under advice of counsel
agrees to divulge information, the requesting party must submit
whatever information is demanded by the website in order to insure
that the website is releasing information to the correct party. 
Other provisions of the OPPA may exempt this website from complying. 
While we take measures to ensure that outside parties do not have
access to any information we have about you, we do not warranty that
outside parties will not breach our system and thus have access to
your information.  (You should know that merchant service providers
do not allow us access to your credit card information.)  This
Privacy Policy also is subject to change without notice.  You are
required to read it prior to using the website.  By interacting with
the website you agree to the terms and conditions of the Privacy
Policy.  By using the website or purchasing a product through this
website, you waive the right to use state or federal court systems to
address complaints and, instead, agree to use the American
Arbitration Association located in a city and county specified
herein.</font></font></p>

means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active,

include pages or 'pop ups' where you register for a newsletter or

visitor surveys; it can include requesting information from the

customer provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone
number, CVV2 (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member
password.  You should consider all this information available to the
website.  This information is used to deliver the product, but under
