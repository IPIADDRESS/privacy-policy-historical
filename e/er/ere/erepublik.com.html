<p>1.1 eRepublik and the eRepublik Service allows people to register as “Citizens” in order to engage and participate in a variety of activities  through  the medium of  an mass multiplayer online social strategy game, a mixture between social platform and a text- based game with social, economical, political, military and media modules. eRepublik users, referred to as “Citizens”, live in virtual replicas of their “real life” countries, with the possibility to become employees, soldiers, party presidents or members, business members, congress members or even country presidents, and use other functionality made available on eRepublik from time to time.</p>
<p>1.2 This policy (together with our Terms and Conditions of Use http://www.erepublik.com/ en/terms-and-conditions and any other documents referred to in it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect  from you,  or that  you provide  to us, will be processed by us.   Please read  the  following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. </p>
<h3>2 How we Collect Information on EREPUBLIK</h3>
<p> 2.1 When registering as a user of eRepublik or during your time as a user of eRepublik you will be asked  to provide  information  to us.    We will  inform you at   the  time of collecting other information from you whether you must provide the information to use eRepublik or a particular eRepublik Service or whether the provision of  information requested by us is optional.   We will inform you at the time of collecting information from you whether  the  information that you provide to us will be accessible to other users of eRepublik or by third parties so that you can decide whether to provide the information to us.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>2.2 We may collect and process the following data about you: </p>
  <p>2.2.1 if you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence;</p>
  <p> 2.2.2 information  that  you submit  when you  register   for   the Website  including your name, date of birth and e-mail address.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>2.3 Persons under 14 years of age are not entitled to register as Citizens on eRepublik. If you are between 14 and 18 years of age you agree that you have made sure that you have brought   this Privacy Policy  to  the attention of  a parent  or  guardian or  a grandparent,   uncle,   aunt,   brother   or   sister   of   the   person   and   that   they   have consented to you agreeing to this Privacy Policy and using the eRepublik (provided that the giving of such consent is not prohibited by law).</p>
<h3> 3 Uses made of the information </h3>
<p>3.1 eRepublik users partake in the virtual eRepublik community by writing shouts about topics of interest, private messages, articles, article comments and blog comments, interacting with other users in the eRepublik discussion forum, using   Citizen   ads   aimed   at   a   particular   target   audience,   creating   articles   to communicate  to   other   users   and   creating   virtual   organisations,   companies   and parties, and so on.   All of these publications and organisations can be accessed in various areas  of  eRepublik  including but  not   limited  to  the  company homepage, Citizen profiles, organisation profiles, party homepages, articles, articles comments, private messages, law proposals, presidential messages, the eRepublik official wiki, Citizenship  request  messages,  all  debate  links,  as well as  in any other  areas of  eRepublik not listed here,  that will or may be created  in  the future.   These shouts,  forum  topics, Citizen ads and articles can then be accessed and read by other users of eRepublik. You can search  for  other   registered users of  eRepublik.     If  you choose  to be a registered user of eRepublik, we will not display your personal information.   Only in- game information will be available to other users, which is information that will allow users to evaluate your views and your eRepublik communications.  </p>
<p>3.2 We use information held about you in the following ways: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>3.2.1 to ensure  that content  from eRepublik  is presented  in  the most effective manner for you and for your computer; </p>

  <p>3.2.3 to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us; </p>
  <p>3.2.4 to deliver and maintain a high quality service;</p>
  <p> 3.2.5 to allow you to access eRepublik and to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so;  </p>

  <p>3.2.7 for the purposes of compiling statistics; </p>
  <p>3.2.8 to determine whether you are in compliance with the eRepublik rules and to impose sanctions where necessary;  and </p>
  <p>3.2.9 to process payments. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.3 Information such as your username, photograph (avatar), geographic location within eRepublik, personal  profile,  Website history profile,  and any personally  identifiable information you have included in the shouts, Citizen ads, articles you publish, or other details you post in any of  the areas of  eRepublik, may be shown  to other users of eRepublik  and   the   eRepublik  Service,   as  well   as   to   other   people,   through   the eRepublik  application  programming   interface   system  (further   described  at   http:// api.erepublik.com/eapi-docs.pdf) (“<strong>eAPI System</strong>”).   eRepublik history profile consists of,  for example, your date of  joining, your rating information,  information about  the amount   of  money   available   in   your   account,   information   about   your   economic, political   or   military   activity   in   eRepublik   and   other   material   which   you   have contributed.    Your  personal  profile would  consist  of,   for  example,   your eRepublik birthday and national rank. </p>
<p>3.4 Information such as shouts  (which may contain personally  identifiable  information) and details of   latest  news,  alliances, wars and military events may be exported  to third party websites which you have chosen to use in eRepublik via the eAPI System. No personally identifiable information will be exported to third party websites via the eAPI System, other  than with your express authorisation  in response  to a  request from a third party user of the eAPI System. Please note that any authorisation that you give to a third party user of the eAPI System to use your data is a matter for you and a third party user of the eAPI System; we are not responsible for the manner in which you choose to allow them use your data.   </p>
<p>3.5 We may sell or licence your shouts, articles, content, data and any other messages you post on any area of eRepublik to third parties for their use, in which case your username  and  any   personally  identifiable  information   you  have  included  in   your shouts,  articles,   private messages  or   through  any  other   in-game  communication channels may be shown to users of such third party websites.   Except as set out in this Privacy Policy,  we do not   sell,   rent,   share,   trade or  give away any  of  your personal  information.   </p>
<p>3.6 We  may   also  use   your   email   address   to   send  you  updates   or   news  regarding eRepublik, but you may choose not to receive emails of this type by unchecking the “Sign up for the weekly newsletter” box on the eRepublik registration page.  You can also   subscribe/unsubscribe   to   this   weekly   newsletter   in   the   Subscriptions   page erepublik.com/en/messages/subscribes/1.   Additionally,  we may contact  you using your email address to notify you that other users have sent you a personal message and  to  inform you  that someone wants  to add you as a  friend,  or  that  they simply want to contact you.   </p>
<p>3.7 We may use your shouts, citizen ads, articles or other details you post in any area of eRepublik  to   personalise  eRepublik   and   identify/feature   popular  members.     For example, we may promote  the most popular and latest shouts, groups, listings and members.   We may also promote most active members.  While we do not expect totransfer the complete member database to others, we use the database throughout our networks and to generate results for others, including, but not limited to, enabling users to contact each other and facilitating inter-user communications.  </p>
<h3>4 Disclosure of your information to other people </h3>
<p>4.1 We do not  disclose  to any  third party personal  information  that  you provide  to us unless we have your permission or we believe the law permits or requires it. </p>
<p>4.2 If  you provide personal   information  to us you understand and agree  that  we may disclose your personal information to the following third parties: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>4.2.1 to the eRepublik hosting provider: Heruvim,  Inc., with  registered office at 12020 Sunrise Valley Drive, Suite 100 PMB 121, Reston, Virginia 20191, United States of  America.    You acknowledge  that  we may  change  the hosting providers at  any  time and any  such  change will  be posted on eRepublik by an amendment  to  this Privacy Policy.    You consent   to  the transfer of your personal data to any new hosting provider’s servers.   You may communicate any questions, comments or requests in relation to any change in hosting provider by emailing office@erepublik.com or by post to 5 Dumitru Cariagdi Street,  2nd District,  Bucharest,  Postal  Code 021518, Romania. </p>
  <p>4.2.2 if  you have indicated at registration, or at any time during your time as a user of eRepublik, that you are happy to receive information or promotions from  selected  third parties about  goods and services which may be of interest to you, you consent to us sending you such offers or information. You may opt out of receiving such offers or change your preferences at any time by emailing office@erepublik.com; </p>
  <p>4.2.3 any member of our group of companies, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries; </p>
  <p>4.2.4 to companies that provide emailing services, with the sole purpose of sending you information about our services, including about any updates, new features or new versions of the eRepublik game.  These companies are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose than as mentioned in this article. You may opt out of receiving such offers or change your preferences at any time by emailing office@erepublik.com;</p>
  <p>4.2.5 any third party user of the eAPI System who or which you have authorised in the manner described in paragraph 3.4 above; </p>
  <p>4.2.6 to  the prospective  seller,  buyer  or  assignee of  any business or  assets related  to eRepublik or  all  or part  of  eRepublik Labs Limited, SC ERPK LABS SRL, or any other member of our group of companies; and </p>
  <p>4.2.7 to a third party if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data with that third party in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order   to   enforce   or   apply   our   terms   and   conditions   of   use   http:// www.erepublik.com/en/terms-and-conditions and other  agreements,  or   to protect the rights, property, or safety of our group of companies, eRepublik, our customers, other registered users or others.  This includes exchanging information with third parties for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>4.3 We will notify you when  information about  you may be provided  to  third parties  in ways other   than explained above,  and  you will  have  the option  to prevent   such information sharing at the time that we notify you.  </p>
<p>4.4 We do not disclose personal  information about you to other third parties (including advertisers or marketing companies) except those set out in this policy, but we may provide  them with aggregate anonymised  information about  eRepublik users.    Forexample, we may  inform  them  that  500 men aged under 30 have clicked on  their advertisement displayed on eRepublik on any given day,  or  we might   inform  third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit eRepublik, the demographic breakdown of  our   community users of  eRepublik or   the activities  that  visitors  to eRepublik   engage   in   while   on   eRepublik.  We   may   also   use   such   aggregate anonymised information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target   (for   example,   women   in   the   southeast   of   Ireland)   when   displaying advertisements on our website.   We may make use of   the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers’ wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.  You agree to these practices. </p>
<p>4.5 It may be necessary to transfer your personal  information to other group companies or  service providers  located  in countries outside of   the European Economic Area (EEA).   This may happen where our servers or suppliers and service providers are based outside of the EEA or where you use our services and products while visiting countries outside of the EEA.  The data protection and other laws of these countries may not be as comprehensive as those in Ireland or the EU but in these instances we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights are respected. You agree that we may transfer your personal  data on that basis.  </p>
