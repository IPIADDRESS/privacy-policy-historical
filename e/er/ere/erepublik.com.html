				<b>The information we collect and store</b> <br><br>


				We collect and store information which you voluntarily provide on our website, electronic or other communications with us, communications between users on our website. We also collect and store IP-addresses, alphanumeric IDs, cookie information and other unique identifiers in order to identify specific computers that access our website. We may track your use of certain features and areas of our website to help us improve them. <br><br>

				We care about protecting your privacy and except as specified above we will not sell, transfer, rent, share or disclose your personally identifiable information to a third party. We assure you that we will not use your email address to send you 'spam' or authorize others to do so. <br><br>

				If you unsubscribe Erepublik, we will keep a copy of your registration data in our database for use in the event you wish to rejoin Erepublik.<br><br>

				Information about your account is displayed to other users in your Erepublik profile, and this same information may be available through automated script calls and application program interfaces. This information includes your username, the date since when you have joined Erepublik, your location, your rating information, the amount of money available in your account, information about your economic, political or military activity in Erepublik. However, we will not display your real name, address, or credit card or bank account numbers, except with your express permission or as otherwise permitted by this privacy policy and our terms and conditions.<br><br>

				We do not collect information from children aged under 14, because only those individuals who are 14 years of age or older are permitted to register. Internet experts advise that preteens (children younger than 13 years old) do not fully appreciate the risk of providing too much personal information online or communicating with strangers they encounter online. Taking into account that preteens may want to use our websites, we urge parents to instruct their children not to lie about their age and to take an active role in the online and offline safety of their children.<br><br>

				We use cookies to track your country and to track whether you entered our website from a link on others sites.
