<h2>The LA Names Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We understand that making purchases online involves a great deal of trust on your part; we take this trust very seriously, and make it our highest priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personally identifiable information ("PII") you provide us. (PII includes information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address).</p>

<p>As a visitor to LA Names' web sites, www.la and www.register.la (<q>LA Names</q>), you have the right to understand our information privacy practices prior to providing LA Names with any of your PII.</p>

<h3>What information we collect</h3>

<p>LA Names only collects PII that you provide to us by email, telephone or online form.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Contact Information:</dt>
<dd>We are required by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (<q>ICANN</q>), the organization which assumes responsibility for domain name allocation, and LANIC the registry administrator of .la to collect certain information about you during the domain name registration process. This information includes your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where provided, your fax number. Such contact information may be used, for example, to communicate with you when necessary with respect to transactions conducted through our websites. Additionally, we may collect contact information provided to us during any correspondence relating to customer support we supply to you, as well as in connection with products and services offered on our website.</dd>
<dt>Financial Information:</dt>
<dd>We also collect and retain certain financial information from you during the domain name registration process, as well as in connection with other products and services which we offer you. For example, when you apply to register a domain name or sign up for any other product or service at LA Names, we require you to provide a credit card number and billing address before we will process that application. We will not sell, share or rent any financial information collected from you except as disclosed in this policy or as necessary to fulfill your order which is processed by our third party service providers CentralNic.</dd>
<dt>Demographic Information:</dt>
<dd>We may collect and store anonymous demographic information (such as your zip code, gender and age), and use this data to tailor your experience at LA Names, provide content that we think you might be interested in, and display the content according to your preferences. Such demographic information may be shared with partners, market researchers and other third parties on an aggregate, non-personally identifiable basis. No personally identifiable information will be linked to aggregated demographic information.</dd>
<dt>Internet Protocol Address:</dt>
<dd>We collect and retain an IP address from all visitors to LA Names. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Site and for purposes of traffic analysis within the website, and to help prevent fraud. No personally identifiable information will be linked to such information.</dd>
<dt>Other Information:</dt>
<dd>We collect and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, our servers track the type of Web browser you are using, and the page to which you link from LA Names. We collect this information to better develop a sense of what services our customers need, but not to track your individual usage patterns, except within our website. We may use such information for marketing purposes, and to send information to you which we believe might be of interest. In addition, such information may be shared with partners, market researchers and other third parties on an aggregate, non-personally identifiable basis. No personally identifiable information will be linked to such aggregated information shared with third parties.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition, we may obtain non-sensitive contact information from third parties, including via bulk access licenses from other registrars.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>

<p>LA Names uses "cookie" technology for such purposes as enhancing your online experience by making it easier for you to navigate through our website and making certain features work better. Cookies are text files which are commonly deposited by Web sites on a user's hard drive when the user visits a Web site. The file identifies a user's computer and can record the user's preferences and other data about the user's site visit. We do not extract information about individual users during this process. Your Web browser may enable you to disable cookies, but please note that certain services may not function correctly without it.</p>

<p>Third Party Cookies: we use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit LA Names. Our third-party advertising companies may also separately place or recognize a cookie file on your browser in the course of delivering advertisements to LA Names. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. However, no personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, email address or telephone number) will be connected with such information.</p>

<h3>Who we share your information with</h3>

<p>LA Names will only share your PII but only as described below. Otherwise we will not provide your personal information without your consent.</p>

<dl>
<dt>WHOIS:</dt>
<dd>We are required by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"), the organization that assumes responsibility for domain name allocation and LANIC the administrator for cc TLD .la to collect information about you during the domain name registration process. This information includes your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where provided, your fax number. ICANN then requires all registrars to make your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where provided, your facsimile number, as well as the creation and expiration dates of your domain name registration and the name server information associated with your domain name, to the public via an interactive Web page and a "port 43" WHOIS service. For the purposes of this Privacy Notice we will refer to this information as your "WHOIS Information." Please note that we may not be able to control how members of the public may use the WHOIS Information.</dd>

<dt>Advertisers:</dt>
<dd>We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</dd>

<dt>Partners:</dt>
<dd>We partner with other parties to provide specific services.  When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.</dd>

<dt>Agents:</dt>
<dd>We engage other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments, providing marketing assistance, providing customer services, sending postal mail and email to you, removing repetitive information from customer lists, and analyzing data. These persons have access to personal information needed to perform their functions. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information that you provide to for any secondary purposes.</dd>

<dt>Service Providers:</dt>
<dd>We engage other companies and individuals to perform enhanced services on our behalf. Many of our service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.</dd>
<dt>Business Transfer:</dt>
<dd>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, if LA Names. or all or substantially all of its assets were ever to be acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</dd>
<dt>Compliance:</dt>
<dd>We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Services Agreement and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of LA Names, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</dd>

<h3>How you can decide what marketing communications you'll receive</h3>
<p>LA Names provides you with the opportunity to specifically choose the promotional marketing communications you wish to receive from LA Names. If you choose not to receive any of the promotional e-mail services that LA Names provides, then LA Names will only send you e-mail that relates to a domain name or service purchase you have made on our websites.</p>

<h3>How we protect your information</h3>

<p>To ensure the confidentiality of your PII, LA Names uses leading security technology and procedures. We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input and the information we may send to our agents. LA Names and its partner Central Nic uses leading procedures and technology to ensure your information is securely obtained and held in compliance with the Card Holder Information Security Program. For example, we encrypt your credit card number before it is stored in our database. This ensures that no one may access your credit card from our system.  In addition it is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.</p>

<h3>What Information Can I Access?</h3>

<p>LA Names gives you access to certain information about you for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. To view or change this information, log-in to your account. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.</p>

We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.
