                <p style="background: white;">At Berlitz, we respect our customers and understand that you are concerned about privacy. Therefore, Berlitz Languages, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, ”Berlitz”) have posted this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) to let you know what kind of information we collect, how it is handled, and with whom it may be shared.</p>
<p style="background: white;"><span>As we continue to develop our websites, including, without limitation, any website or URL of ours that we have linked to this Policy (collectively “websites”), and take advantage of technologies to improve the services we offer, this Policy will likely change. We encourage you to refer to this Policy on an ongoing basis, so that you understand our current Policy.</span></p>
<p style="background: white;"><span>If you are a past or present employee of Berlitz who is based in the European Union or European Economic Area, please see the section below on “Information Received from the European Union or European Economic Area.”</span></p>
<p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>What Information Do We Collect?</span></strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong><span>Personal Information</span></strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="background: white;"><span>We collect various types of “personal information” depending upon how you use our websites, such as:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style="color: #0b0b0b;">When you order from us, we collect your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit card number with expiration date.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #0b0b0b;">When you order from us, we may retain a record of your account and purchase information.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #0b0b0b;">When you enter a sweepstakes or contest online, we usually collect your name, address, email address, and phone number. We also may ask you for additional information, such as your age, interests, product preferences, or zip code.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #0b0b0b;">When you submit an inquiry, we need your name, email address and zip code to respond.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="background: white;"><span>If you do choose to give us personal information through our websites, we will collect and retain that information, and you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers. We will retain your personal information as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or not prohibited by law.</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li><strong><span>Non-Personal Information</span></strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="background: white;"><span>When you use our websites, we may also collect "non-personal information," which is information that, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (such as your age, gender, income, education, profession, zip code, etc.) or technical information (such as your IP address, the type of browser you are using). Non-personal information may also include information that you provide us through your use of our websites, such as the terms you enter into the search functions of our websites.</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
    <li><strong><span>Cookies and Similar Technologies</span></strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="background: white;"><span>When you visit or interact with our websites or services, we or our authorized service providers may use cookies, clear gifs, log files, flash cookies and similar technologies for the functioning of our services, to help us improve our performance, or to give you extra functionalities, all with the goal of providing a better experience.</span></p>
<p style="background: white;"><span>The common types of tracking technologies (collectively “cookies and similar technologies”) used by Berlitz include:</span></p>
<p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Cookies:</span></strong><span> A small piece of information sent by a website that is saved in the memory of your computer's browser or device. It holds information a site may need to interact with you and personalize your experience. At Berlitz, we use two kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies.<br>
<br>
Session cookies exist only for as long as you stay on Berlitz’ websites or your browser remains open. Once you exit your browser or leave Berlitz’ websites, they go away. We use session cookies to maintain information we need to have in order for you to shop at our websites. For example, the Session ID cookie that we ask your browser to hold retains the ID for your shopping bag. Without the Session ID cookie, you can't add merchandise to your bag and carry it to Checkout.<br>
<br>
Persistent cookies last from visit to visit. They are stored in your browser’s cache or device until you choose to delete them. We may use persistent cookies to give you a more personalized shopping experience and to help you navigate our site more efficiently.<br>
<br>
Cookies can be used by a website to recognize you. But that does not necessarily mean any personal information is stored in the cookies. At Berlitz, we store no personal information about you in the cookies. Anything you choose to tell us about yourself (such as your address and email address) is stored on our secured servers. Please visit www.allaboutcookies.org for more information about cookies and how to disable them.</span></p>
<p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Web beacons:</span></strong><span> Small graphic images (also known as "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs") that may be included on our websites, services, applications, or tools, that typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our users and user behavior.</span></p>
<p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Similar technologies:</span></strong><span> Technologies that store information in your browser or device utilizing local shared objects or local storage, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies, and other web application software methods. These technologies can operate across all of your browsers, and in some instances may not be fully managed by your browser and may require management directly through your installed applications or device. We do not use these technologies for storing information to target advertising to you on or off our websites.</span></p>
<p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies by Authorized Third-Party Service Providers</span></strong></p>
<p style="background: white;"><span>We may work with third-party companies, commonly known as service providers, who are authorized to place cookies and similar technologies on our websites with our permission. These service providers help us to provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience.</span></p>
<p style="background: white;"><span>These service providers may use cookies and similar technologies to help us deliver our own content and advertising, and compile anonymous site metrics and analytics. We do not authorize any of these service providers to collect any of your personal information on our websites for their own purposes. Third-party cookies and similar technologies are covered by the third parties' privacy policies.</span></p>
<p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Do Not Track</span></strong></p>
<p style="background: white;"><span>Berlitz currently does not respond to Do Not Track signals in browsers. While we collect personal information from you as described earlier in this Policy, we do not collect personal information from you to monitor your online activities across third-party websites or online services (also known as behavioral advertising or interest-based advertising).</span></p>
<p style="background: white;"><span>Third parties that have content embedded on Berlitz’ websites (such as buttons, widgets, and other embedded features or content) may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that you visited our websites from a certain IP address. We do not authorize third parties to collect any other personal information from Berlitz’ websites unless you provide it to them directly.</span></p>
<p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>How Do We Use Your Information?</span></strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong><span>Personal Information</span></strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="background: white;"><span>If you choose to provide personal information to us, we may use your information in a number of ways, including the following:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
