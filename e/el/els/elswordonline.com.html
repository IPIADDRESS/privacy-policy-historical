  <br>
  KOG-LU, Inc. dba Kill3rCombo and its affiliated companies ("Kill3rCombo", the "Companies," "we," "us") offer this web site (the "Site") and all Site-related services and products, including, without limitation, massively multiplayer online role-playing and multiplayer online casual games (the "Service") solely for playing purposes. Our foremost goal is to create and maintain measures to protect the privacy of our customers.  Customer satisfaction is a great priority for us and we realize that our success is dependent on respecting our customers' rights.<br>
  <br>
  Kill3rCombo respects the privacy of all visitors who visit the Site and use the Service.  However, we may collect certain information from visitors. This Privacy Policy governs your interaction with the Site and your registration for and use of the Service. Except as set forth within this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use and End User License Agreement or other published guidelines, we do not release personally identifiable information about users without their permission. By using the Service, you imply your acceptance to this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, End User License Agreement, and other Kill3rCombo rules, policies, notices, agreements and guidelines.<br>
  <br>
  Kill3rCombo reserves the right to change its privacy policies as needed.  If there any material changes to this Privacy Policy, they will be posted on the Service and/or in an updated Privacy Policy. Customer usage of our Service after the changes will be understood as your acceptance of the changes. <br>
<br>
The Company may gather the following types of information from the users:<br>
<br>
A. Personal information provided by you on a voluntary basis. You may visit the Site without providing us with any personally identifiable information. However, if you sign up for an account or send us an e-mail, we require that you provide us with certain personally identifiable information. If you make purchases in connection with your use of the Service, you will be required to provide us with your credit card information (including a valid credit card number, expiration date and shipping and billing addresses). You will be notified each time your personally identifiable information will be collected by a third party payment service (or other third party). If you do not wish to provide your personally identifiable information to any such third party, you may choose to not provide your information at that time. This Privacy Policy itself serves as notice to you that we collect personally identifiable information at certain times during your use of the Service<br>
<br>
B. Non-personal information. Other than the personal information, when you use the Service, we may collect information telling us which pages of the Service you visit, the order in which you visit them and which hyperlinks you "click." Collecting such information can involve logging your IP address (i.e., the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP")), your MAC address, operating system specifications, identification of your hard drives and other storage devices, and browser software used to access the Service. We reserve the right to scan and obtain information from your computer, software, and parts or portions thereof, including, but not limited to, your computer's random access memory, video card, central processing unit, hard drive(s) and any other storage devices in order to assist our efforts in policing users who may implement programs and/or scripts used to develop and/or use "hacks" and/or "cheats" to gain advantage over other users. The scan shall detect the use of such programs, including, but not limited to packet editors and cheat engines which are in violation of Kill3rCombo Terms of Use. These types of information are not generally personally identifiable.  We can determine from an IP address your ISP and the geographic location of your point of connectivity.  When you sign up for any account, you also are asked to provide us with a username, password and a Forum name. You must also provide a character name whenever you create a character for your account.<br>
<br>
The company uses "cookies" which are the customer identification cards for the computers, or servers, that placed them there.

You should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser software. <br>
<br>
Kill3rCombo does not control the actions of our customers. Any information our customers post in a bulletin board, chat room, or the Forum while visiting our games may be used by other users.  Any information disclosed will be at your own risk; we are not responsible for information that you choose to disclose on the Service, or for the actions of other users. We reserve the right (but shall have no obligation) to monitor your use of bulletin boards, chat rooms, guest books or other forums.<br>
<br>

<br>

We encourage our affiliates, advertisers and business partners to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our users and to otherwise handle personal information in a responsible manner; however, we do not guarantee their compliance nor assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use information received either from us or independently.

In addition, in the event we reorganize, file for bankruptcy or engage in similar events (whether voluntarily or otherwise), user information (whether non-personally identifiable or personally identifiable) may be transferred to our successors and assigns. <br>
<br>
<span class="guides-character-text-ffffff-14">CHILDREN</span><br>
We do not knowingly collect or store personally identifiable information from children (defined herein as minors younger than thirteen (13) years of age). The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act imposes certain requirements on web sites directed toward children under 13 that collect information on those children, or on websites that know they are collecting personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. It is currently our policy not to collect personally identifiable information from any person under 13 and we request that children under the age of 13 not to provide any personal information to us via the Site. Children under the age of 13 years old are prohibited from creating their own account; but may use the Site and Service under the strict guidance and supervision of their parents or guardian and only when using their parent's or guardian's Service account. If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personally identifiable information from children under 13 years old, we will attempt to notify such child's parent or guardian as the owner of the account and erase such information from our records.<br>
<br>
If you are the parent or guardian of a child who is between the ages of thirteen and eighteen (18) who has created his or her own account or is authorized by you to use your account (if under the age of 13), we urge you to instruct your child to NEVER give out his or her real name, address, phone number or other personally identifiable information while using the Service. If you are under the age of eighteen (18), you should encourage your parents or guardian to review this policy and to contact us with any questions. If you are under the age of thirteen (13) years old, you should not attempt to register for an account and should not otherwise access this Site or Service without the unequivocal permission of your parents or guardian.<br>
<br>
<span class="guides-character-text-ffffff-14">PROMOTIONS, CONTESTS &amp; SWEEPSTAKES</span><br>
At times, Kill3rCombo will sponsors promotions, contests or sweepstakes, or third parties sponsor promotions, contests or sweepstakes in conjunction with the Service. The privacy policy for such promotion, contest or sweepstakes will be posted in conjunction with the applicable official rules.<br>
<br>
<span class="guides-character-text-ffffff-14">WEB SITE LINKS</span><br>
The Site may contain links to other Internet web sites. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, we are not responsible for the actions or the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. <br>
<br>
<span class="guides-character-text-ffffff-14">YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS </span><br>
