<p>We may use service companies on  our behalf to perform services for you but these companies are not allowed to  use your information for their own purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Internet technologies</strong><br>
		    We use a variety of technologies  on our Web site. Among these are cookies, which are pieces of information that  our Web sites provide to your browser. Cookies also allow us to customize your  visit to our Web site by recognizing you, for example, when you return to the  site. Cookies allow us to track overall site usage and determine areas users  prefer. You can choose to decline cookies while at our Web site, however, this  may limit your ability to access certain areas of the Web site. Most browsers  accept and maintain cookies by default. Check the "Help" menu of your  browser to learn how to change your cookie preference. </p>
<p>We may access and set cookies  using Web beacons, also known as single-pixel GIFs which are invisible  graphical images. These Web beacons tell us useful information regarding our  site such as which pages web visitors view.</p>
<p>When we track activity on this or  other eLagaan Web sites, we collect information such as your IP address,  browser type and version, and pages you view. We also keep track of how you get  to our sites and any links you click on to leave our sites. We do not track  URLs that you type into your browser, nor do we track you across the Internet  once you leave our sites. We use your Web site activity to assist you by  reducing the need to re-enter your data and to help us resolve technical  support issues. We may also use this information to offer you a personalized  Web experience, and to tailor our offerings to you. Remember, you control  whether you receive eLagaan marketing materials.</p>
<p>To assist us in collecting site  usage data, we use service providers to place web beacons on specific pages of  our site and pass back usage information about that page via the use of cookies  to these service providers. Personally identifiable information is not sent to  eLagaan or our service providers through the use of these cookies or web  beacons and all web navigation data is used only in the aggregate to improve  our product and site performance.</p>
<p>We use clear gifs in our  HTML-based emails to let us know the number of emails that have been opened by  recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications  and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We do not tie the information  gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please visit "My account”  section.</p>
<p>Advertising networks that serve  ads on our Web site may assign a different cookie to you. The information  collected is anonymous and is not linked to your personal information. These  cookies may be used to select which ads you see and determine the effectiveness  of this advertising. You may choose to decline cookies from third-party ad servers,  which eLagaan does not control. Any information that these third parties  collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would like  more information about this practice and your choices, click here (<a href="http://www.advertising.com/Privacy.html">http://www.advertising.com/Privacy.html</a>)  and here (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>).  We do not share, rent or sell any personally identifiable information  (including email address) to these companies.</p>
<p>On occasion, we will enter into a  written contract with third party intermediary companies to help us to complete  a business process, service, or function on our behalf. Without limitation,  third party intermediaries may specialize in providing services such as:  consulting or contracted development and maintenance, temporary workers, data  processing, as well as direct and network marketing. These third party  intermediaries may not use or retain personally identifiable information  (including email address) for any secondary purpose. Additionally, they may not  divulge, rent or sell any information (including email address) that may be  gained through their relationship with eLagaan.</p>
<p>eLagaan may also enter into  marketing alliances and joint marketing relationships. eLagaan's relationship  with these companies shall not represent our endorsement for the products or  services these companies offer; and, are only being made available within  eLagaan.com to serve as added conveniences for our site's visitors. Unless you  have supplied your consent, we do not share your name and other personally  identifiable information (including email address); and, we shall never sell or  rent any information that identifies you personally or individually. Otherwise,  for a third party intermediary to obtain your contact information or personal  data, you, yourself, will need to supply them with your information or become  their direct customer. If you consent to share your personal information with a  3rd party through eLagaan.com, you may unsubscribe by contacting us.</p>
<p>Written agreements are  established between eLagaan and all third party intermediaries, as well as  joint marketing and alliance companies. Each agreement strictly limits the use  of your personally identifiable information to the scope of the contract.  Contractual agreements, such as these, also stipulate safeguard, handling, and  other precautionary care procedures, which are required to be taken. The  contractual agreements we have in place and/or establish also govern  confidentiality rights by limiting the information that we can share to include  only aggregated statistical data.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have business  partners that provide services, some of which are co-branded. Partner services  and sites are clearly identified. When you request any of these products or  services, you are permitting us to provide your personal information to the  partner to fulfill your request.</p>
<p>Occasionally, eLagaan products  are promoted on the Web sites of another organization. In some instances when  you access our products through the Web site of that other organization, we may  provide your personal information back to that specific organization. When we  do so, we will tell you at the time we collect your personal information and we  will provide you a link to the organization's Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may use sources outside of  eLagaan to supplement the personal information you give us. For example, we may  validate your address using other sources or we may provide you with  demographic, household or non-public personal information. We use this data to  help us maintain accuracy and provide you with better products and services.</p>
<p>Lamingo and its subsidiaries may  exchange personal information, which may include exchange across country  borders, about your transactions to fulfill your requests. We may also provide  you information about products or services we believe you may be interested in  unless you have asked us not to contact you. We offer you the opportunity to  review privacy practices at our subsidiaries' Web sites.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Web Sites</strong><br>
		    eLagaan may contain links to  third-party Web sites. Each of these links shall be clearly identified. eLagaan  does not direct or oversee the policies, procedures, or other practices for  companies other than eLagaan. eLagaan does not endorse the products and  services that are offered by third party companies. The presence of third party  links within eLagaan.com are for convenience purposes only and should not be considered  as representing an endorsement by us.

<p><strong>Security Measures</strong></p>
