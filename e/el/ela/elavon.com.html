		<h2>Privacy</h2>
		
		
   
    <p>Last Update: March 13, 2008</p>
    
    <p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE OR SUBMITTING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION. BY USING THIS WEBSITE YOU ARE AGREEING TO THESE PRIVACY TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE.</p>
    
    <h3>Commitment to Privacy</h3>
    <p>This site, <a href="http://www.elavon.com">www.elavon.com/acquiring</a>, and any and all sites that we may own and operate in the future (collectively "the Site"), is owned by Elavon, Inc., a Georgia corporation ("Elavon,” "We"or “Us”). We respect the privacy of every individual who uses the Site and we will only process and use the data obtained through the Site for our own business purposes. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") outlines the information we will collect and how we will use that information.</p>
    
    <h3>Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>Because of changes in Internet technology and practices, this Privacy Policy, and our security and other policies may change from time to time. Please consult this portion of the Site for important changes to the Privacy Policy as they occur. Unless otherwise provided in an agreement between you and us, by using the Site after we post any changes to this Privacy Policy, you agree to accept those changes, whether or not you have reviewed them, and such acceptance shall be deemed legally conclusive. If at any time you choose not to accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should not use the Site, nor should you provide information about yourself or your business to us.</p>
    
    <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
    <p>When you access and/or use this Site, we or our service providers may obtain data concerning that access and use. If you request information from us or register to use any limited access portions of the Site you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information about yourself. This data may include, but is not limited to, your name, address and other demographic information, professional data, telephone number, and email address. We will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily. If you opt not to provide us with personally identifiable information, no material consequences will result, although there may be services that may be unavailable to you.</p>
    
    <h3>Use of Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
    <p>We may store and process your personally identifiable information in order to fulfill any requests for information that you make of us, or to better understand your needs and to learn how to improve our services and products. We may also use your personally identifiable information to contact you (for example, we may send you marketing or promotional materials or other information, we may respond to your comments or requests for information, we may ask you for feedback on products and services or we may contact you if needed in the course of processing your requests). We may also use your personally identifiable information in accordance with any agreements that you may have entered into with us.</p>
    
    <p>If you do not wish us to send you any information concerning new services or other matters offered by us please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@elavon.com">privacy@elavon.com</a> to notify us of your wishes.</p>
    
    <h3>Notice to European Users</h3>
    <p>Any information you supply may be stored and processed on our computers in the United States, which does not have data protection laws that provide the same protections as the laws of the Member States of the European Economic Area. However, your information will be handled in compliance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.</p>
    
    <p>Personal data generated in the European Economic Area will be processed in accordance with the European Commission Directive 95/46/EC and applicable laws of the Member States.</p>
    
    <h3>Disclosure</h3>
    <p>To enable us to more efficiently provide the products and services you have requested from us, we may share your personal information with selected third parties who are acting on our behalf as our agents, suppliers, or providers. Such third party service providers are provided only with such information as is necessary under the circumstances. Information provided to third parties is used only for the purposes stipulated and those third parties are subject to confidentiality obligations. We may also enhance or merge personally identifiable information with data obtained from third parties for any of the foregoing purposes. Nothing in the Privacy Policy shall be deemed to prohibit us from disclosing your identity or information if we are required by law to do so.</p>
    
    <h3>Contacting Us Regarding Your Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
    <p>If you have submitted personally identifiable information through the Site, or if someone else has submitted your personally identifiable information through the foregoing, and you would like to review, request changes or have that information deleted from our databases, please contact us via e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacy@elavon.com">privacy@elavon.com</a>, or send a letter to our Privacy Compliance Officer at One Concourse Parkway, Suite 300, Atlanta, GA 30328 USA. We will then use reasonable efforts to change or remove your personally identifiable information from our files, unless we are entitled or required to retain it pursuant to other agreements or by law. We will use reasonable efforts to supply you with this information and correct any factual inaccuracies in this information. Notwithstanding the prior two sentences, if your laws provide you with additional protections or require us to comply with more stringent obligations to provide you with, remove, or correct your personally identifiable information, we will comply with those legal requirements.</p>
    
    <h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <p>In some cases, we may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include but are not limited to the frequency of your use of this Site and the route by which you choose to access it and your use of any hyperlinks available on this Site. We and our service providers, agents or advisors may process and use this data for purposes including but not limited to, planning Site development, assessing patterns of use, planning and assessing marketing initiatives by us, or to include you in e-mail or mailing lists so that we may send you information or updates and or offer you services.</p>
    
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>"Cookies" are small text files that are either used for the duration of a session ('session cookies'), or saved on a user's hard drive in order to identify that user the next time he/she logs on to the Site ('persistent cookies'). We may use 'session cookies' to identify registered users logging in to the Site. These cookies are deleted from the component's server soon after the session ends and are not collected or saved. We may also use 'persistent cookies' when a registered user clicks on the "save password" check box on login. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that, although if you do disable cookies from your browser you may not be able to access certain sections of the Site.</p>
    
    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>We use reasonable measures to protect personal information from access by unauthorized persons. This includes, among other things, standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection, and site monitoring. We also use reasonable internal controls to protect personal information from misuse by our employees. Unfortunately, no electronic data or transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we use reasonable measures to protect personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted or otherwise provided to us or received from us. This is especially true for information that is transmitted via e-mail that is unprotected until it reaches our servers. Once a transmission is received, we use the reasonable measures set forth above to secure our servers.</p>
    
    <p>Internally, we restrict access to personally identifiable information to employees who need access to the information in order to do their jobs. These employees are limited in number and are required to comply with our privacy policies.</p>
    
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <p>This Site is not intended for use by persons under the age of 18. If you are under 18, do not use this Site. If parents believe their minor children have accessed this Site and provided their personally identifiable information, please contact us using the information provided in the "Contact Use Regarding Your Personal Identification Information" section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
    
    <h3>Other Sites</h3>
    <p>The Site may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other websites. Users are encouraged to review the privacy policy of any website linked from the Site.</p>
    
    <h3>Transfer of Business Assets</h3>
    <p>As we continue to develop our business, we might acquire or buy other businesses or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that all or substantially all of our assets are acquired, both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable user and customer information will be amongst the transferred assets.</p>
