When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Netscape Navigator® or Microsoft Internet Explorer®) automatically transmits some information to ElcomSoft every time you access content on one of our sites. Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version you are using to access our site. All of this information may be collected by ElcomSoft and used to help improve our offerings to you. We use such data to facilitate and track your use of the Website and its services.  ElcomSoft also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Website.  Without expressly informing you in each particular circumstance, we do not match such information with any of your personal information.
<p></p>
When you place an order for software or services online, you are re-directed to a third-party Website operated by RegNow.  This company administers its own Privacy Policy that is not under the control of ElcomSoft.  Prior to placing an online order, please review <a href="http://www.regnow.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">RegNow's Privacy Policy</a>.  
<p></p>
Information that you provide while using products such as the Guestbook feature is available for all to see. Discretion should be used in entering Personally Identifiable Information within such forums, as it may be collected by third parties. ElcomSoft does not actively associate the message content entered by our users in the Guestbook with any registration information we may possess.  Our server computers will retain this information, however; and it is potentially available for distribution to third parties - most obviously law-enforcement agencies acting under subpoena power, per the terms of our Privacy Policy. We do not use this information to target any advertising to our users, nor is it ever willingly distributed to any third party, such as an advertiser, except if subpoenaed.
<p></p>
You are provided an opportunity on the ElcomSoft Website to subscribe to a periodic newsletter.  This newsletter is a marketing tool that allows the company to inform you of new products and services, as well as other news relevant to the company.  The subscription service requires you to provide your first and last name as well as your email address.  Optionally, you are asked to provide the name of the company you represent.  You are given the opportunity to choose the type of information we provide to you.
<p></p>
While the subscription list is maintained by a trusted third party affiliate, the list remains the sole exclusive property of ElcomSoft.  Your name and email address is not shared with any third party and will not be used to send you unsolicited communications.  A link is provided to allow you to change your subscription preferences, including cancellation of your subscription.
<p></p>
When you submit personal information to ElcomSoft through this Website, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which ElcomSoft and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices.  You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of ElcomSoft.  Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.  
<p></p>
ElcomSoft may establish relationships with various service providers whose services may become available to you from this Website or from websites that are linked to this Website.  Typically, these providers would offer services that ElcomSoft customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with ElcomSoft services and products.  In order to use those services, you may be required to provide personal information to the providers.  Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide while you are visiting a provider's Web site will be subject to the privacy policy posted on such site, and personal information that you provide while on this Website in conjunction with a provider's service will be subject to this Privacy Policy.  You should be aware that our agreements with these service providers often provide that they will share with ElcomSoft personal information collected from you.  In such instances, ElcomSoft may use this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
<p></p>
<b>Updating Your Personal Preferences</b>
<p></p>
You may correct your personal information and privacy preferences (such as whether you wish to receive promotional communications from ElcomSoft or third parties) by filling our <a href="/contacts.html">contacts form</a>.
<p></p>
<b>Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information</b>
<p></p>
ElcomSoft operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems.  Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users.  
<p></p>
ElcomSoft takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you use these services at your own risk.   
<p></p>
We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. After personally identifiable information reaches ElcomSoft it is stored on a server with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of ElcomSoft. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our offices or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the sites covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored in various countries where ElcomSoft and its service providers conduct business.  All ElcomSoft employees are aware of our privacy and security policies.  Your information is only accessible to those employees who need it in order to perform their jobs.
<p></p>
<b>C. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</b>
<p></p>
How your personal information is used
<p></p>
ElcomSoft collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select.  We will use your e-mail address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help to process the purchase or service you have selected.  If you subscribe to a service or register a product, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users.  Your personal information is also used to keep you informed about product upgrades, patches, special offers, and other products and services of ElcomSoft and selected third parties if you have so opted to receive such communications.
<p></p>
ElcomSoft may collect information about the use of the Website, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily.  This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. ElcomSoft may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.
<p></p>
ElcomSoft recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on this Website. Without your consent, ElcomSoft will not communicate any information to you regarding products, services, and special offers available from ElcomSoft or its affiliates, although we may find it necessary to communicate with you regarding your use of the services on this Website.  Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, ElcomSoft will also not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.
<p></p>
<b>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</b>
<p></p>
ElcomSoft does use the services of third parties, such as e-mail service providers, purchase and order processing merchants and marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of ElcomSoft.  These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose ElcomSoft specifies.  We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us.  We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the ElcomSoft's affiliates for their use without your approval.
<p></p>
ElcomSoft may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. ElcomSoft may also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use, End User License Agreement or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under confidentiality agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining ElcomSoft.
<p></p>
In the event that all or substantially all of ElcomSoft's stock and/or assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) are transferred or sold to another entity, or ElcomSoft (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by, or merged with, another entity, ElcomSoft may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity and ElcomSoft may provide to such entity customer information that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without your consent.  If, as a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes.
<p></p>
<b>Choices available to you</b>
<p></p>
You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the ElcomSoft Website. Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information.  
<p></p>
You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from ElcomSoft or from having your personally identifiable information shared with selected companies. If you want to opt out, you can do so by editing your preferences with respect to email or the sharing of information. If you elect to "opt out" we will not, as applicable, share your personal information with third parties or send you emails. However, we may continue to use your personal information for internal purposes, to enhance your user experience or as necessary to administer the site or comply with applicable law.
<p></p>
We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status.  We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of our Terms of Use or End User License Agreement. 
<p></p> 
ElcomSoft is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters which will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications are rare. 
<p></p>
