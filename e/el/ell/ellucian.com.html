When that is the case, the applicable contract provision shall supersede any conflicting provision in this Privacy Statement.</p><h3>Ellucian’s Role as a Service Provider to Its Customers</h3><p>Ellucian offers product solutions to its customers to store and manage their electronic documents, document metadata, and data relevant to managing an institution of higher education. Ellucian is a global organization and may provide product development services, solution engineering services, professional technical services and product technical support services to its customers from any country in which Ellucian has facilities or personnel.

In this Privacy Statement we refer to Personal Data from the EEA or Switzerland as “EEA or Swiss Data”. </p><p>Ellucian collects EEA or Swiss Data (i) from individuals who visit our Site, and (ii) from our customers, vendors, contractors and agents, including the following specific types of information:</p><ul><li>Contact information, including name, address, email address and phone number</li><li>Student records provided by Ellucian’s higher education customers</li><li>Professional and employment information</li><li>Financial information</li><li>Identification information, including driver’s license and passport numbers</li></ul><p>Ellucian recognizes that the EEA and Switzerland have established strict protections regarding the handling of EEA or Swiss Data, including requirements to provide adequate protection for EEA or Swiss Data transferred outside of the EEA and Switzerland. </p><p>To provide adequate protection for certain  EEA or Swiss Data relating to website visitors, customers, prospective customers, partners, vendors, third-party suppliers and contractors that Ellucian receives in the U.S., Ellucian complies with the Privacy Shield as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the EEA and Switzerland to the U.S. Ellucian has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield. Ellucian adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Privacy Shield, the Privacy Shield shall govern.</p><p>Ellucian will only process EEA or Swiss Data in ways that are compatible with the purpose for which Ellucian collected the EEA or Swiss Data, or for purposes that the individual or entity providing the EEA or Swiss Data later authorizes. Before we use your EEA or Swiss Data for a purpose that is materially different than the purpose for which it was collected or that you later authorized, we will provide you with the opportunity to opt out. Ellucian maintains reasonable procedures to help ensure that EEA or Swiss Data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.</p><p>We may collect, or our customers may provide to us when using Ellucian services, certain EEA or Swiss Data that is regarded as “sensitive,” including data concerning racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, ideological views or activities, trade-union membership, administrative or criminal proceedings/sanctions, information on social security measures, or data concerning health or sex life. When we directly collect sensitive EEA or Swiss Data, we will obtain opt-in consent where the Privacy Shield requires, including if we disclose sensitive EEA or Swiss Data to third-parties, or before we use sensitive EEA or Swiss Data for a different purpose than we collected it for or than the data subject later authorized.</p><h3>Access Rights</h3><p>You may have the right to access the EEA or Swiss Data that we hold about you and to request that we correct, amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the Privacy Shield. These access rights may not apply in some cases, including where providing access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances or where it would violate the rights of someone other than the individual requesting access. If you would like to request access to, correction, amendment, or deletion of your EEA or Swiss Data, you can submit a written request to the contact information provided under 
    <a href="#contact" title="Contact Us">General Terms</a> above. We may request specific information from you to confirm your identity. In some circumstances we may charge a reasonable fee for access to your information. If your EEA or Swiss Data was provided to us by an Ellucian customer, we may facilitate your access to such data by directing you to the customer that provided your Personal Data to us.</p><h3>Security</h3><p>Ellucian maintains reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect EEA or Swiss Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction in accordance with the Privacy Shield.</p><h3>Data Transfers to Third-Parties</h3><p><em>Third-Party Agents or Service Providers</em>.
