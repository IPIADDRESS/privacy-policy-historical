<h2>Service Providers</h2>

<p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service (“Service Providers”), to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</p>

<p>We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.</p>

<h4>Google Analytics</h4>

<p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service.

<p>You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.</p>

<p>For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy &amp; Terms web page: <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a></p>

<h3>Payments</h3>

<p>We may provide paid products and/or services within the Service. In that case, we use third-party services for payment processing (e.g. payment processors).</p>

<p>We will not store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.</p>

<p>The payment processors we work with are:</p>

<h4>Stripe</h4>

<p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
