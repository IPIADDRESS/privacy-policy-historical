We invite all visitors to, or users of, the Site (“You”) to carefully review this Privacy Policy before continuing to access or use the Site.</p>


      <p>We collect certain personally identifiable data that You submit through the Site (“Personal Data”) as well as other non-personally identifiable data that we collect through cookies and other tracking technologies (“Data”) in order for us to understand Your needs better and make Your experience at the Site more valuable to You. We may share this Personal Data and Data with our affiliates and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the Personal Data that we have requested, but, if You chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide You with our products or services or respond to any queries You may have.</p>

      <p>You may sign up for membership, post articles, network with others or otherwise actively send us Personal Data using the Site. “Personal Data” includes, but is not limited to, Your name, email address(es), billing address(es), delivery address(es), telephone number(s), contact preferences and credit card information. Personal Data may also include Your education and work history and other skills and characteristics related to Your past, current or future occupational endeavors. You can amend or update Your Ellevate profile at any time and You can close such profile at any time. We use Personal Data primarily for the purpose for which You originally provided it (for example, to receive access to member events, to network with others, or the like), and for purposes of improving our products and services and for market research. We may use Personal Data to transmit direct marketing communications to You by email.</p>

      <p>This Site is not intended for use by persons under the age of thirteen. Individuals who are under the age of thirteen are expressly prohibited from submitting to Ellevate or posting to the Site any personally identifiable information about themselves.</p>

      When You visit the Site, we may passively collect Data through the use of cookies on Your computer and Internet connection, such as the IP address of Your computer and/or Internet service provider, the date and time You access the Site, the Internet address of websites from which You link to our Site, the computer technology You are using and Your movements and preferences on our Site. We may also use such cookies to collect information in connection with future visits to the Site (such as to remember Your user name and password), to recognize You as a previous visitor, and to track Your activity on the Site. We also reserve the right to use other technologies such as Internet tags, web beacons, and navigational Data collection tools to administer, protect, and improve our Site and our systems. We use this information for internal use only; we don't share it with others. If You choose to refuse to accept cookies, You may experience loss in Site functionality.<p></p>
      <p>From time to time, we may contract with selected third parties that provide services on our behalf to maintain our Site, analyze data, provide marketing and customer assistance, and provide other services. The Personal Data that we obtain through this Site may be accessed by these third parties as necessary to perform their functions, solely on our behalf, but we generally do not authorize these service providers to make any other use of Your Personal Data. By accepting to be bound by the Terms of Use You are consenting to our disclosure of such information to such third parties. We may also use data we have about You (such as the interests and preferences You have expressed) to determine whether You might be interested in career opportunities of a particular third party. We may also disclose Personal Data to financial institutions or other third parties in connection with performing payment transactions. We do not otherwise disclose Your Personal Data to third parties, unless such disclosure is required by law, necessary in connection with a legal claim or proceeding, necessary to protect the rights or interests of Ellevate or third parties, necessary to prevent a crime or protect national security, or necessary to protect the personal safety of users or the public.

      <p>We reserve the right to disclose information submitted by or concerning any Member, as we reasonably believe is necessary to protect our systems or business. Specifically, but without limitation, we reserve the right to disclose such information when a Member is in violation of our Terms of Use or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably suspected of partaking) in any harmful, infringing or illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution, or to suspend or terminate Your membership in connection with any suspected illegal or infringing activity.</p>
