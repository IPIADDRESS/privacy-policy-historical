        <h4>How Do We Use Cookies?</h4>
        <p class="indented">When you visit the website, we place a "cookie" on the hard drive of your computer to track your visit.  A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your hard drive through your web browser that can only be read by the website that placed the cookie on your hard drive.  The cookie acts as an identification card and allows our website to identify you and to record your passwords and preferences.  The cookie allows us to track your visit to the website so that we can better understand your use of our website so that we can customize and tailor the website to better meet your needs. </p>
        <p class="indented">Most web browsers are set to accept cookies.  However, on most web browsers you may change this setting to have your web browser either: (1) notify you prior to a website placing a cookie on your hard drive so that you can decide whether or not to accept the cookie; or (2) automatically prevent the placing of a cookie on your hard drive.  It should be noted that if cookies are not accepted, you will not be able to access a number of web pages found on the website. </p>
