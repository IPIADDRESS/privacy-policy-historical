          <p>ELLIE MAE is committed to honoring the privacy of visitors to our
            corporate and affiliate Web sites. Our Web site describes our information

          <p><a name="info"></a>What information does ELLIE MAE® ask for
            and how is it used? </p>
          <p>We make every effort to protect our partners, affiliates, and individual
            consumers, but we do not control the privacy policies or business
            practices of third-party Web sites. When our business partners and
            affiliates register for services provided by ELLIE MAE®, they
            are asked to provide certain information such as their name, business
            address, contact information, and company description. We only ask
            for this information so that our account managers and Web site coordinators
            can maintain quick, effective communication and constantly personalize
            our business services to your requirements. Your registration, contact
            information, and any passwords you may be issued are also required
            for your secure movement and transaction processing throughout our
            Web sites. </p>
          <p>However, certain third-party Web sites to which we provide links
            or which are hosted by ELLIE MAE® for public use have different
            or additional terms of use, (including different privacy policies),
            which you should read, so that you fully understand particular uses
            of personal information by third parties who are partnered or affiliated
            with ELLIE MAE. Because ELLIE MAE does not control activity on any
            third party Web sites, even when hosted by ELLIE MAE, ELLIE MAE makes
            no representation concerning the use and/or disclosure of any information
            provided to such third party Web sites. </p>
          <p><a name="choose"></a>Do I get to choose what information I disclose? </p>
          <p>Yes, our business partners and affiliates can always choose whether
            or not to disclose personal or business information through ELLIE
            MAE®. Certain information is of course required for registration
            and to establish and securely manage your ELLIE MAE account, but
            other requested information may be optional. Specific questions about
            what information is currently required should be addressed to the
            account manager and Web site coordinator who establish your account. </p>
          <p><a name="access"></a>Who has access to the information that I provide
            to Ellie Mae? </p>
          <p>We use basic information which we collect to make your business
            relationship with ELLIE MAE® more productive and tailored to
            your individual preferences. We require specific additional information
            when you subscribe to some customized services, and we store that
            information in secure databases. We share some aggregate statistical
            data with companies from which we obtain analytical and marketing
            services or partnerships. These companies do not have access to our
            secure database, and we never provide these companies with access
            to any consumers' financial, personal, or loan-transaction information
            which we store on behalf of our business partners and affiliates.
            From time to time, we may be asked to disclose such information to
            third parties as part of a legal proceeding (i.e. subpoenas and criminal
            investigations); in such cases, ELLIE MAE will disclose personally
            identifiable information as required by law. </p>
          <p><a name="change"></a>What if I need to change the personal or business
            information I previously disclosed? </p>
          <p>All changes in our partners' and affiliates' contact or business
            information should be sent immediately to the account manager and
            Web site coordinator who manage your account. Private consumers who
            use the mortgage services of our partners and broker affiliates should
            contact them directly by e-mail or by phone to update personal and
            loan-account information. </p>
          <p><a name="contact"></a>Who can I contact if I have any questions
            regarding my privacy? </p>
          <p>If you have specific questions about ELLIE MAE®, you can contact
            us directly through our e-mail "info" address provided below. For
            more general information, we recommend the Web site published by
            the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which includes news and commentary
            about privacy protection on the Worldwide Web; or go directly to
            their FTC Search page, enter the words "Internet privacy" (without
            quotes) in the text field, and hit the Search button. We also highly
            recommend the Yahoo! list of Web sites with information about privacy
            issues. </p>
          <p><a name="cookie"></a>What is a "cookie" and how does it work? </p>
          <p>We occasionally use software "cookies" (tiny data files sent to
            and stored by the client computer's web-browser software) to let
            you use our services more efficiently, and to let us keep track of
            statistical traffic information that helps us improve our Web site.
            One extremely valuable service provided by cookies is that they can
            save many preferences which you have established for navigation,
            searching, and shopping in your favorite Web sites. After your computer
            has requested and received a cookie from an Internet server, the
            cookie simply allows you to visit Web site pages repeatedly without
            having to reintroduce yourself each time you return. No other user's
            computer on the Worldwide Web will have that same cookie, and only
            the Web site which issued that cookie can later retrieve it. A Web
            site can transmit one or (rarely) more cookies to the user's browser
            software, and each may have a very different purpose. Cookies from
            our server contain only information which a user volunteers, or which
            guarantees the secure transmission of their data across the Internet,
            or which can automatically disconnect a user's "log-in" session after
            a period of inactivity (in case you go to lunch but forget to "log
            off"). </p>
          <p>Some ELLIE MAE® Web site services may not function correctly
            if the user's browser software cannot accept cookies. Recent versions
            of Web browsers can be customized so that a cookie is always accepted-but
            only after the user is advised and consents. </p>
          <p>Cookie Choices in Your NETSCAPE® Browser: </p>
          <p>Beginning with version 4.0, Netscape Navigator gives users the power
            to control cookies. In version 4.0 and higher, you can activate your "Cookie
            Alert" by pulling down the "Edit" menu and selecting "Preferences." Click "Advanced
            Settings" at the bottom of the dialog box, and choose from the following: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accept all cookies.
            </li><li>Accept only cookies that get sent back to the originating server.
            </li><li>Disable cookies. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Another option is for Navigator to warn you before accepting a cookie.
            Every time there is an incoming cookie, a dialog box will ask if
            you want to accept it. </p>
          <p>Cookie Choices in Your MICROSOFT® Browser: </p>
          <p>Beginning with version 4.0, Microsoft Internet Explorer gives users
            the power to control cookies. To enable cookies within Internet Explorer
            4.0 and higher, select "View | Internet Options" and go to the "Advanced" tab.
            Scroll down to the Security section and select "Always accept cookies".
            If the user wants to see each cookie that the browser receives, they
            should select "Prompt before accepting cookies" in the Advanced tab
            and a Security Alert dialog will appear before a cookie is accepted. </p>
          <p>Caveat Web-Surfer: </p>
          <p>Before choosing to have your Web browser warn you of all incoming
            cookies, keep in mind that some web pages may have more than 100
            cookies and you will be notified about each one separately. </p>
          <p><a name="personal"></a>What does Ellie Mae do with the non-public
            personal information it receives regarding its business partners'
            , affiliates' or mortgage broker clients' customers? </p>
          <p>Ellie Mae provides a wide range of services to its business partners,
            affiliates and mortgage broker clients. In connection with these
            services, Ellie Mae often receives non-public personal information
            about the customers of its business partners, affiliates and mortgage
            broker clients. Except as permitted by law, Ellie Mae does not share,
            disclose or otherwise use non-public personal information that it
            receives from its business partners or mortgage broker clients about
            its business partners' or mortgage broker clients' customers. Federal
            privacy regulations limit the manner in which Ellie Mae may re-use
            or re-disclose this information, and Ellie Mae complies with these
            regulations. </p>
