Please be sure to read this Privacy Policy before using our web site or submitting information to us. Your use of this web site is subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is subject to change from time to time, so please check back periodically. By accessing and using our web site, and by providing us with your information, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our site. Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.</p><p class="elf-content-paragraph">If you are under age 18, please review this Privacy Policy with your parents and ask them to explain about anything you do not understand. If you are under age 13, we apologize for any inconvenience as you cannot currently use our site or service. Elfster is concerned with the safety of children and will comply with Federal privacy regulations under COPPA by not collecting information from children under the age of 13.</p><p class="elf-content-paragraph">If you have questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please contact Elfster via the email address help@elfster.com or via postal mail at the following address:<br><br>3500 S Dupont Hwy<br>Dover, DE 19901</p><h3 class="mbs mtl">Personal Information collected from you</h3><p class="elf-content-paragraph">Elfster respects each individual user's right to privacy. Elfster collects personal information provided from users during site registration, contests, surveys or use of public areas. The personal information collected on the site includes your first and last name, email address, mailing address, mobile phone number, birthday and year, login name, password, and gender. You may also provide us photographs or other video materials, which may contain personal information. We may collect personal information when you register on, log on, or visit our Web sites, including when you participate in activities on our Web sites, such as sweepstakes, contests, games, and informational and promotional offers, and when you provide information to our customer service representatives.</p><h3 class="mbs mtl">Use of Personal Information we collect</h3><p class="elf-content-paragraph">From time to time, we may share aggregated site traffic information with our partners and advertisers. Also, your information is visible to the person buying for you and people in your group in order to help them buy an appropriate gift and deliver that gift to you. If you come to Elfster and/or are using our services through a partnered branded site, such as the one with Claireâ€™s Stores, we will share your data with that partner, and anyone acting on their behalf.</p><h3 class="mbs mtl">Information collected from technology</h3><p class="elf-content-paragraph">In addition to information we ask from you specifically, our Web site also tracks some information passively. This information is collected in order to assure that our site runs smoothly, and that you have a good experience using Elfster services. When you visit our Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes the browser you are using, your IP address, the URL that referred you to our site, and all of the areas within our site that you visit. We use this information only in a general context that does not personally identify individual users but still allows us to analyze trends concerning our site and thus improve it accordingly.</p><h3 class="mbs mtl">Cookies</h3><p class="elf-content-paragraph">Non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of Elfster's Internet servers (i.e. log file information like IP address) or through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small text files that our site places on your computer's hard drive to recognize repeat users and to facilitate your use of the site. Also, our cookies allow the tracking of site usage and the compilation of aggregate data for content improvement, targeted advertising, and marketing and promotional purposes.</p><p class="elf-content-paragraph">Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). Users should be aware that Elfster cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or other third parties. Most browsers allow a user to deny cookies; however, users should note that cookies may be required to provide certain web site features. Also, users may opt out of receiving those cookies using a resource such as the Network Advertising Initiative (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org</a>). The information collected in these cookies cannot be linked to personally identifiable information.</p><h3 class="mbs mtl">Blogs</h3><p class="elf-content-paragraph">If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p><h3 class="mbs mtl">Third Party Advertising</h3><p class="elf-content-paragraph">Some of the ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by our Web advertising partners. Information about users' visits to this site, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to users on this site. Please understand we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for third parties to place advertising on elfster.com.</p><h3 class="mbs mtl">Opt-In and Opt-Out</h3><p class="elf-content-paragraph">Once registered, users who no longer wish to receive general communications may opt-out of (i.e., discontinue receiving) these communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the general communication email and setting their preference. We offer opt-out mechanisms in the text of each general communication email we send, and you may also contact us at the email or street address at the top of this page to opt-out. Unless otherwise stated in this policy, Elfster does not share, sell, rent, or trade personally identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes.</p><p class="elf-content-paragraph">If your personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if you no longer desire our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate your personally identifiable information. This can be done at Elfster.com or by contacting us via 
            &nbsp;<a href="mailto:help@elfster.com">help@elfster.com</a>.</p><p class="elf-content-paragraph">Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order, or a legal process served on our Web site.</p><h3 class="mbs mtl">Security</h3><p class="elf-content-paragraph">Elfster uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information disclosed to us secure. This includes the use of fire walls, secure sockets layer encryption, and secure facilities. If an Elfster user knowingly provides personal information, such as a name or email address, in an answer or public wish list item or other public service, message or bulletin board, that user should be aware that the information provided can be collected and used by third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Elfster.</p><h3 class="mbs mtl">For Children Under 18 Years Old</h3><p class="elf-content-paragraph">ATTENTION KIDS: No information should be submitted to Elfster by anyone under 18 years of age without their parent's or guardian's consent. Currently, we are not accepted any registrations from Children under 13 years of age.</p><h3 class="mbs mtl">Changes and Updates</h3><p class="elf-content-paragraph">Elfster reserves the right to make material changes this policy at any time by posting notice of the existence of a new privacy statement. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post a prominent notice on our homepage 30 calendar days prior to implementing the changes so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p><h3 class="mbs mtl">YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h3><p class="elf-content-paragraph">California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of the Elfster.com who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
