									<p><font size="-1"> This is the web site of *Elfster* home of those who have been 
											naughty and nice.
											<br>
											<br>
											Our postal address is:
											<br>
											<br>
											&nbsp; 4328 Leach Ave.
											<br>
											&nbsp; Oakland, CA
											<br>
											<br>
											Send your North Pole correspondence to <a href="mailto:santa@elfster.com">santa@elfster.com</a>
											or dial Santa’s media elf at 510.530.6673.
											<br>
											<br>
											For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only 
											the domain name, but not the e-mail address or one’s naughtiness quotient. We 
											leave that strictly to Santa and his elf cabinet. And, hey, with the military 
											satellites of&nbsp;NORAD regularly tracking&nbsp;Santa's Christmas Eve route, 
											our tracking your domain is nothin’.
											<br>
											<br>
											The information we do collect is used to improve the content and quality of 
											your Christmas gift and of our Web site. There are times when your information 
											will be used to notify our community of elves about updates to our Web site or 
											changes in our stocking stuffer policy. To be honest, this is part of a 
											collective bargaining agreement because there are some of Santa’s helpers 
											always threatening a winter of discontent while soused up on Sherry.
											<br>
											<br>
											If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please send us an 
											e-mail up here in the snowy white hinters at the above address. Otherwise, 
											please understand that we struggle with the limits on our resources. There just 
											aren't enough hours in Christmas Eve, even when (thanks to shifting the sleigh 
											through time zones) it's a day of 31 hours. But the elf council thought it was 
											more important for Santa to get the job done, than to personally apologize for 
											an unwanted email. You let us know, and we will let the customer service elf 
											center know and you know, no more emails. No.No.No.
											<br>
											<br>
											Let’s face it, who hasn’t heard of Santa? Therefore, with respect to Ad 
											Servers, we do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad 
											server companies. Santa simply doesn’t need any more press than he’s getting. 
											He’s constantly tucking his beard in his red suit, and wearing shades in the 
											Pasta Pomodoro, North Pole. The guy can’t get a break.
											<br>
											<br>
											If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the 
											policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you 
											with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how 
											your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.
											<br>
											<br>
											Upon request we provide site visitors with access to a description of 
											information that we maintain about them, which includes but is not limited to 
											your gift wish list, your status in Santa’s database as captured by his chief 
											elf, and your HoHoHo Ranking ™.
											<br>
											<br>
											Santas can access this information by e-mailing us at the above address.
											<br>
											<br>
											Santas can have this information corrected by sending us e-mail at the above 
											address. With respect to security in our homeland, the North Pole and yours: We 
											have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities (eg 
											igloo) to protect against the loss (no gifts for you, lump of coal only), 
											misuse (unwrapped or used) or alteration of information (mistaking you for one 
											of the other 5,319 Homers out there) that we have collected from you at our 
											site. </font>
									</p>
									<p><font size="-1"> No matter how many times John Ashcroft asks, we’re not sharing your 
											information. We can’t, we’re Santa’s little helpers.
											<br>
											<br>
											If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, call 
											the elf call center and start yelling. </font>
