		    You must agree to the <a href="/cgu">Terms of Service</a> before enjoying the benefits of a registered user.</p>
		<p>
		    Each MEMBER can share personal information on forums accessible by other
		    MEMBERS. Here’s how it works:
		</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>
		        Any MEMBER can view Forum discussions, comments or any other private
		        information that a MEMBER may post to the PLATFORM.
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        We don’t share your private information with anyone (except for operating the

		    BEEMOOV has instituted measures to protect the security and content of the forums.

		<p>
		    BEEMOOV regularly monitors its forums through a team of volunteers, a country
		    manager and potentially others acting on behalf of BEEMOOV. BEEMOOV does
		    not control the content of any messages before publication. Any delays in such post-publication
		    review may result in potentially substantial distribution to an online audience
		    before actual review.

		<p><strong>
		        You should avoid disclosing any personal information that you do not wish to make
		        public to other MEMBERS.
		    </strong>

		</p><h3>
		    Collection of Information
		</h3>
		<p>
		    When you visit our Website we may collect information regarding your visit from your
		    computer. Such information helps us to determine information about how you found our
		    Website, the date that you visited our Website and search engines that may have led you
		    to our Website. We collect this information in order to continually improve and enhance
		    the functionality of <a href="http://www.eldarya.com">www.eldarya.com</a>
		</p>

		<p>
		    Generally, you may provide us with two types of information, User Content, which
		    may include Personal Information, and Website Usage Information, both of which are
		    discussed in greater detail below.
		</p>

		<h4>
		    Retention of Information

		<p>
		    Your Personal Information may be retained for the period of your ongoing use plus up
		    to three years after you expressly terminate your membership or your account is dormant
		    for a period of four months. The tracking cookies may be retained for the period of your
		    ongoing use after such termination or dormancy. Such retention periods may be extended
		    if mandated by law or otherwise required for the protection of our rights.
		</p>

		<h4>
		    Children under age 13

		<p>
		    <strong>
		        This website is not directed to children under the age of 13 years. If you are under

		        are under 13, you should be smart and not provide any information on
		        your identity, physical location or online contact information unless you
		        do so under your parent’s consent and supervision.
		    </strong>
		</p><h3>Personal Information You Choose to Provide</h3>

		<p>
		    In order to make your visits to our Website as enjoyable as possible, we may ask you for
		    Personal Information. Personal Information includes, for example, your email
		    address, which you are asked to provide when registering with BEEMOOV.
		    Below is a description of some of the ways that you may provide Personal Information to
		    us, as well as further details on how we may use such Personal Information.
		</p>
		<div class="indent">
		    <h4>
		        1. Sign-Up Information and Profile
		    </h4>
		    <p>
		        You provide us with Personal Information, such as your email address,
		        when you register a Member account with the Website. You may also choose to
		        add information to your profile.
		    </p>
		    <h4>
		        2. Contact Us/Feedback
		    </h4>
		    <p>
		        If you email us at <a href="mailto:support@beemoov.com">support@beemoov.com</a>, we may ask you for information such as your name and email address so we can respond to your questions and comments. If you choose to correspond with us via email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our response to you. In certain cases, and with your permission, we may post content from your emails to us on the BEEMOOV Website.
		    </p>
		    <h4>
		        3. Questionnaires and Surveys
		    </h4>
		    <p>
		        We may occasionally ask users of our Website to complete online surveys and
		        opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. These surveys help us
		        better serve you and improve the usefulness of BEEMOOV. In requesting your
		        participation in these surveys we may ask you to provide your name and email
		        address to us.
		    </p>
		    <h4>
		        4. User Content
		    </h4>
		    <p>
		        Our Website offers its users the opportunity to share User Content – for instance, on your user profile, status, the forum and through private messages. If you choose to use these features, you should be aware that any Personal Information you submit through
		        these features can be read, collected, or used by other viewers of these forums and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the Personal Information you choose to submit in these forums.
		    </p>
		    <h4>
		        5. Import Contacts
		    </h4>
		    <p>
		        We may utilize an “import contacts” feature to help you keep in touch with your
		        contacts and other members. This may make it easier for you to invite people from your
		        email address book to join you on our Website. If implemented, you can manually import a file from your email program or you can provide us with your email username and
		        password and the BEEMOOV program will import your email contacts for you.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		        If you import your contacts, we may ask you if you wish to invite or follow
		        your colleagues from your same domain. If you indicate that you would like to
		        follow them, we will send them an invitation from you (with a return address
		        of <a href="mailto:support@beemoov.com">support@beemoov.com</a>) to activate a BEEMOOV account and join the same
		        domain network as you. We may also send one reminder message after the
		        original invitation if we do not hear back from them. People you invite to join the
		        Website may opt out of receiving further emails from BEEMOOV as described in
		        the Rights to Opt In/Opt Out section below.
		    </p>
		</div><h3>Website Usage Information</h3>
		<div class="indent">
		    <h4>
		        1. Cookies
		    </h4>
		    <p>
		        We may use “cookies” on or in connection with our Website to maintain
		        information about you. A cookie is a very small text document, which often
		        includes an anonymous unique identifier. BEEMOOV employs the use of both
		        “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your
		        hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your
		        browser on subsequent visits to the Website. Persistent cookies can be removed
		        by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and
		        disappears after you close your browser.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		        When you visit our Website, our computer may ask your computer for permission
		        to employ the use of a session or persistent cookie. Our Website will then send
		        a cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect
		        your privacy) your browser only permits our Website to access the cookies it has
		        already sent to you and not the cookies sent to you by other websites.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		        Most web browsers can be adjusted to inform you when a cookie has been sent to
		        you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. However, refusing
		        a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the
		        display or function of, our Website or certain areas or features of our Website.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		        We work with business partners who provide advertising, technology services
		        and other that goods and services to make your visit more interesting. We permit
		        such business partners to add cookies to your computer and track your use of their
		        information or services. We require such business partners to respect our privacy
		        policy.
		    </p>
		    <h4>
		        2. IP Address and Clickstream Data
		    </h4>
		    <p>
		        Our servers automatically collect data about your Internet Protocol address when
		        you visit us. When you request pages from our Website, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name.

		    <p>
		        We may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or
		        subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law,

		    <p>
		        We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.

If this occurs, we will notify you as described in “Updates to our Privacy Policy”
		    </p>
		</div><h3>Consent to Worldwide Transfer and Processing of Personal Data</h3>
		<p>
		    By providing Personal Information to us through this Website, you agree that it may be used by us and our Affiliated Parties for the purposes described herein and you further understand and consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries and territories, which may have different privacy laws from your country of residence and which may afford varying levels of protection for your Personal Information. Regardless of the laws in place in these countries, we will treat the privacy of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By providing your Personal Information to this Website, you consent to our transmission to, and processing of your information in, any jurisdiction, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
		</p>
		<h3>
		    Your Access and Correction Rights
		</h3>
		<p>
		    You retain the right to decline to submit Personal Information through BEEMOOV, in which case BEEMOOV may not be able to provide certain services to you. However, if you choose to provide Personal Information to BEEMOOV, we will provide you with the ability to access, correct, update or delete the Personal Information you have provided to this Website by emailing <a href="mailto:support@beemoov.com">support@beemoov.com</a> We will respond to your request within 30 days.

		<h3>
		    Third-Party Websites
		</h3>
		<p>
		    When you are on this Website you may have the opportunity to visit, or link to, other websites, including other websites operated by BEEMOOV or by unaffiliated third parties.

		</p>
		<h3>
		    Security
		</h3>
		<p>
		    BEEMOOV and our partners uses commercially reasonable and industry standard physical, managerial and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information. We also use Secure Sockets Layer (BEEMOOV’s business partners, who permit purchases undertaken by players, use SSL technology) encryption to transmit sensitive information. While BEEMOOV endeavors to protect the security and integrity of sensitive Personal Information provided to this Website, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.
		</p>
		<p>
		    If you contact us by email or a “contact” or similar feature on the Website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. An unaffiliated third party could view information you send by these methods in transit. We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.
		</p>
		<p>
		    In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your email address, we may notify you by email. You consent to our use of email as a means of such notification. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@beemoov.com">support@beemoov.com</a> with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.
