								<h1 class="headline"><em>ELDERCARE</em>LINK Privacy Policy</h1>
								<p>Updated May 4, 2009</p>
								<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please see our 
									contact details at the end of this document.</p>
								<h1 class="headline">Your privacy is our main concern</h1>
								<p><em>ElderCare</em>link, a division of QuinStreet, Inc. ("<em>ElderCare</em>link"), has created 
									this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to safeguarding 
									the privacy of your personal information. <em>ElderCare</em>link is not a covered entity 
									under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, often referred 
									to as HIPAA. However, we value your privacy and we will collect and use 
									information through the ElderCarelink.com website (the "Site") only in the ways 
									disclosed in this statement. This statement applies solely to information 
									collected through the Site.</p>
								<h1 class="headline">Part I. Information Collected</h1>
								<p><em>ElderCare</em>link collects information through the Site at several points and in 
									several ways.</p>
								<p class="headlineSmall">Personally Identifiable Information Collected</p>
								<p>We collect personal information that Users furnish to us through the Site on a 
									voluntary basis. The Site is designed to match providers of services who are 
									clients of <em>ElderCare</em>link ("Providers") with individuals who need services like 
									those furnished by the Providers ("Users"). We collect User-submitted 
									information such as Email, Name, Address, and Phone Number and other 
									information as to User-requested services. This information is collected and 
									used by <em>ElderCare</em>link in the operation of the Site, including submission of 
									User information to prospective Providers. Although we inform Providers of the 
									confidential nature of information sent to them using the Site, we cannot 
									control or be responsible for how such Providers may use such information once 
									it is received. If you provide personally identifiable data to us, you may 
									later elect to have your information deleted from our files, or kept from being 
									used for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the 
									opt-out procedures set forth below. Our Site may offer forums, chats or message 
									boards. Please be advised that information posted in these venues becomes 
									public knowledge and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your 
									personal information. Any information posted on a forum, chat or message board 
									is subject to our Terms of Use. If you choose to submit, post or transmit 
									information through a forum, chat or message board, <em>ElderCare</em>link will collect 
									the information as provided by you. <em>ElderCare</em>link retains this information as 
									necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot 
									problems as permitted by law and pursuant to our Terms of Use.</p>
								<p class="headlineSmall">Non-Identifiable Information Collected</p>
								<p>Like most standard website servers, we gather information automatically from 
									your browser or Internet session and store it in log files. This information 
									includes your internet protocol (IP) address, the browser type that you are 
									using, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform or 
									operating system on your computer, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We 
									use this non-personally identifiable information to analyze trends, administer 
									the Site, track user's movement in aggregate, and gather broad demographic 
									information for aggregate use. We do not link this automatically collected data 
									to personally identifiable information. We use third party software to collect 
									anonymous, non-personally identifiable information. These vendors collect 
									information such as your IP address and do not allow us to identify you 
									personally. We do not share this non-identifiable information. We use cookies. 
									A cookie is a small text file that our Web server places on a User's computer 
									hard drive to be a unique identifier. Cookies enable <em>ElderCare</em>link to track 
									usage patterns and deliver customized content to Users. Our cookies do not have 
									an expiration date. Our cookies do not collect personally identifiable 
									information. Some of our business partners use cookies on our Site (for 
									example, advertisers). We have no access to or control over these cookies, once 
									we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. You may 
									disable or reject cookies if your browser permits. Please be advised that this 
									may prevent you from accessing certain features of the Site. We use 
									registration pages and contact forms to collect personal data and traffic logs 
									to determine site statistics and to collect non-identifiable data.</p>
								<h1 class="headline">Part II. Use of Information by <em>ElderCare</em>link.</h1>
								<p class="headlineSmall">Use of Personally Identifiable Information</p>
								<p>Certain of the information collected by <em>ElderCare</em>link will be used for marketing 
									and customer service purposes. In addition to our referral arrangements with 
									our Providers, we also have marketing arrangements with certain other Providers 
									that are either: (i) engaged in health care-related activities (other than 
									general eldercare products and services); or (ii) marketing services and 
									products that are useful to seniors and/or their families (such as medical 
									treatment or research of a particular disease or condition). From time-to-time, 
									we may send you information about products or services that are offered by 
									these other Providers that we believe you may be interested in based on the 
									information you provided in the <em>ElderCare</em>link Consumer Needs Survey. For 
									example, if you indicated to us that the care recipient has Arthritis, we may 
									notify you about a company that offers Arthritis treatment or that is engaged 
									in a clinical study of Arthritis. However, we will not forward your information 
									to these other Providers unless you explicitly authorize us to do so. You may 
									decide whether or not you want to authorize us to forward to such Provider(s) 
									the information you provided in the <em>ElderCare</em>link Consumer Needs Survey so that 
									you can receive information about these products or services directly from the 
									Provider, which may include email, direct mail, and/or a phone call as well as 
									access to premium content. Registered Users may also receive additional 
									announcements from us about products, services, special deals and a newsletter. 
									In addition, personal information may be combined with information collected 
									from other sources to assist with targeting ads to your preferences and 
									behaviors, and for other sales and marketing efforts of <em>ElderCare</em>link. The 
									information we collect may be used to create customer profiles based on 
									browsing or purchasing history. We may supplement information collected at our 
									Site with data from other sources. We employ commercially reasonable efforts to 
									protect the information furnished to us by Users from unauthorized use by third 
									parties. However, in no event will the information provided by Users be deemed 
									confidential or result in any liability to you on our part if such information 
									is inadvertently released by us or accessed by third parties without our 
									consent.</p>
								<p class="headlineSmall">Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</p>
								<p>The non-personally identifiable information that we collect is used for 
									marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other content 
									in an effort to create a more personally relevant experience and to evaluate 
									the effectiveness of Internet properties. The information is also used to 
									predict responses to advertisements and to help determine which ads perform 
									best, which content is most appropriate for different individuals, how our 
									visitors use the Site, and which pages and features are most popular.</p>
								<h1 class="headline">Part III. Links to Other Web Sites.
								</h1>
								<p>This Site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by 
									<em>ElderCare</em>link. <em>ElderCare</em>link is not responsible for the privacy practices or 
									the content of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they 
									leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website 
									that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies 
									solely to information collected by <em>ElderCare</em>link.</p>
								<h1 class="headline">Part IV. Information Sharing with Third Parties.</h1>
								<p>There are instances in which your personally identifiable and non-personally 
									identifiable information is shared with third parties, as described below.</p>
								<p class="headlineSmall">Clients</p>
								<p>When you elect to request information from <em>ElderCare</em>link or one or more of our 
									clients, we may transfer that information within <em>ElderCare</em>link or route your 
									information to our client(s), across borders and from your country or 
									jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world, so that they 
									may provide the information on their product or service that you requested. We 
									may also disclose information to an affiliate or third party who provides 
									substantially similar services as the original service about which you 
									requested more information. In such situations, we will provide you with an 
									opportunity to opt-out of such sharing.
								</p>
								<p class="headlineSmall">Partners</p>
								<p>Your non-personally identifiable information may be shared with third party 
									partners of <em>ElderCare</em>link on an anonymous basis, for example, to track clicks 
									on advertisements. We also share aggregated demographic information about our 
									user base with our customers. This information does not identify individual 
									users.</p>
								<p class="headlineSmall">Service Providers and Agents</p>
								<p>We partner with other third parties to provide specific services. These third 
									parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for 
									the purpose of providing these services.</p>
								<p>Occasionally we hire other companies to provide other services on our behalf, 
									such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer 
									support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our 
									services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they 
									need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality 
									of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any 
									other purpose.</p>
								<p class="headlineSmall">Legally required disclosures</p>
								<p><em>ElderCare</em>link reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information 
									as required by law, and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect 
									our rights or the safety of users and to comply with judicial proceedings, 
									court orders or legal processes served on the Site.</p>
								<p class="headlineSmall">Business Transactions</p>
								<p>In the event that <em>ElderCare</em>link goes through a business transition, such as a 
									merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its 
									assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the 
									assets transferred.</p>
								<p class="headline">Part III. Problem Resolution and Opportunity to Opt Out</p>
								<p>If problems arise, Users may contact <em>ElderCare</em>link by email at: <a href="contactus@ElderCarelink.com">
										contactus@ElderCarelink.com.</a> We are committed to resolving disputes as

									tell us not to make some of the uses of such information described herein or

									receive our updates or promotional/marketing communications via email, you may 
									opt-out by following the instructions to unsubscribe including in the
