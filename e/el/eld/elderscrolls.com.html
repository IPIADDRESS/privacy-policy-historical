        <p><b><a name="3"></a>What types of information does ZeniMax collect and
          how will it be used?</b><br>

          In order to give you the best experience on our site, ZeniMax may collect
          information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us.
          Typically, we may ask a user to submit personal and/or demographic information,
          and it will usually take the form of either: 
          (1) <a href="#a">product and warranty registration</a>; 
          (2) <a href="#b">community forum registration</a>, including Tell-A-Friend services; 
          (3) <a href="#c">contests, sweepstakes, promotions and/or event registration</a>, 
          (4) <a href="#d">technical support</a>; 
          (5) the purchase of a product or service at our <a href="#e">digital marketplace</a>; 
          (6) <a href="#f">beta testing and/or other product participation and evaluation</a>; 
          and/or (7) <a href="#g">personal information submitted in a business capacity</a> (e.g., resumes submitted to through our recruiting service provider's page).   

          We also implement on certain websites <a href="#h">social media features</a>, including <a href="#i">Facebook and other OpenID providers</a>. he types of information that may be requested for each activity and the way the information may be used are detailed below. In the event that demographic information is requested on the same page as personal information, the demographic and personal information may be combined.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><u><a name="a"></a>Product and Warranty Registration</u>
            <p>
              To register on our website, we may ask you to provide personal information such as your name, email address, home address, and telephone number. We may also collect demographic information including your age, information about the product you purchased, the type of console or PC hardware you own, and the types of games you enjoy playing. The information that you submit during registration may entitle you to limited warranty protection and technical support set forth in connection with your purchased product.  We may also use your registration information to notify you about updates to our products and services.</p>
          </li>
          <li><u><a name="b"></a>Forum Registration</u>
            <p>To register for membership in any of our online community forums, we may ask you to provide personal information such as your email address, and to create a username and password. We may also collect demographic information about you, including your occupation, hobbies and interest, and other preferences.

            <p>The ability to participate in the community forums by simply logging in is available to only those Web users that have already created a password during an earlier visit to the community registration area of our website.

          </li>

        <p>You can always choose not to submit personal information to us.  However, if you choose not to submit personal information when requested, you may not be able to participate in certain activities on our website and may considerably limit the services we can provide you.

        <p><b><u>Tracking Technologies</u></b></p>

        <p><u>Cookies</u></p>
        <p>ZeniMax may use cookies to improve the use of our websites. A "cookie" is a small file or record-keeping device that websites often store on a user's computer. Storage of cookies on your system provides an easy and convenient method for us to personalize your experience on our websites. For example, cookies allow us to remember your screen name, tell us that you have visited our website before, and may contain information that will make your next visit to our website more enjoyable and for these reason our cookies may be tied to personally identifiable information such as your email address.  In addition, ZeniMax will not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. You can always disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer.</p>
        <p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our website.  A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.</p>

        <p><u>Third Party Cookies</u></p>
        <p>The use of cookies by our tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>

        <p><u>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</u></p>
        <p>We also have third party advertising partners that employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our website by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on webpages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Some of the information gathered by clear gifs (such as email address) may be tied to your personally identifiable information to obtain general website traffic information and evaluate user functions for marketing purposes.</p>
        <p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  You may opt-out of future communications by following the unsubscribe instructions included in the promotional email.</p>

        <p><u>Flash LSOs</u></p>
        <p>We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control or high game score, or display content based upon what you view on our website to personalize your visit.  Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your website browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.</p>
        <p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.  Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.  To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here:<br>

        <p><u>IP Addresses</u></p>
        <p>ZeniMax may also collect your IP address for safety and security purposes. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.</p>

        <p><u>Log Files</u></p>
        <p>Other non-personal information collected by ZeniMax is in the form of logs - files that record website activity, including how many "hits" a particular webpage is getting (a.k.a., "click-through data"). For example, log file entries are generated every time a visitor clicks the "Online Shop" icon on our website. These entries enable ZeniMax to assess overall website activity, track interest in advertised sales, track interest in purchase behavior, and troubleshoot technical concerns.</p>
        <p>Through the use of log files, we may also collect certain demographic information such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows 7 or Mac OS), and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).</p>

        <p><u>Advertising</u></p>
        <p>We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other website.  Our ad network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (link to TRUSTe opt-out:  <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/" target="_blank">http://preferences.truste.com/</a> ).  Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

        <p><u>Third Party Advertising</u></p>
        <p>On some of our website, we may integrate third-parties that publish ads on that website.  When you view or click on an ad a cookie will be set to help better provide advertisements that may be of interest to you on this and other websites.   You may opt-out of the use of this cookie by visiting that company's privacy page.</p>

<p><a class="backtotop" href="#top">Back to top.</a></p>

        <p><b><a name="7"></a>With whom does ZeniMax share my personal information?</b></p>
        <p>From time to time, ZeniMax may employ and share your personal information with entities that use it solely to provide support for the internal operations of our website(s) (e.g., fulfillment of contests or online purchases, message board operation, and technical support processing). Our contracts with these service providers do not permit use of your information for their own marketing purposes.</p>
        <p>ZeniMax may also share your personal information with our subsidiary or affiliate companies for purposes of internal marketing and demographic studies, which help us improve and tailor the products and services we provide you.</p>
        <p>Other than as explained in this policy, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes; when we deem it necessary or appropriate to disclose personal information to law enforcement authorities; respond to any claims; or, to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ZeniMax, our customers, or the public.</p>
        <p>In addition, information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, sale, transfer of ZeniMax assets, acquisition, bankruptcy, or similar event.</p>

<p><a class="backtotop" href="#top">Back to top.</a></p>

        <p><b><a name="8"></a>What is ZeniMax's policy regarding links to third party websites?</b></p>
        <p>You should be aware that while you are on a website operated by ZeniMax, you may be directed to other websites that are beyond our control and for which we are not responsible. Because we cannot guarantee that the privacy policies of these websites meet our high standards and the requirements of the TRUSTe, we recommend that you read the privacy policy of the website to which you link before you submit any personal information.</p>

<p><a class="backtotop" href="#top">Back to top.</a></p>

        <p><b><a name="9"></a>Can I choose how my personal information is used?</b></p>
        <p>If you prefer not to receive marketing information from our websites, email notices from our message board operators, or any other communication from ZeniMax, please do not "opt-in" when you register or at the time you submit your information. If you've already opted-in, but you wish to stop any further communications, just let us know by sending an email to: <a href="mailto:privacy04@zenimax.com">privacy04@zenimax.com</a> or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each promotional email.</p>

        <p><b><a name="9"></a>Service-related Announcements</b></p>
        <p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.</p>
        <p>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p>

        <p><b><a name="11"></a>Does ZeniMax collect personal information from children under 13?</b></p>
        <p>ZeniMax does not knowingly request or collect personal information such as name, address, or email address from children younger than 13 years of age. To determine who is under 13 years old, we ask all users who wish to register online for a particular service (e.g., product, forum, or technical support registration) to submit their date of birth. Those visitors that indicate that they are under 13 are not allowed to register online.</p>
        <p>We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children's use of online activities regularly.</p>

        <p><b><a name="12"></a>What safeguards does ZeniMax use to protect my personal information?</b></p>
        <p>While ZeniMax takes reasonable precautions against possible breaches of our websites and customer databases, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure.  Consequently, ZeniMax cannot and does not guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur.  ZeniMax urges you to take steps to keep your personal information safe by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place (separate from your account information, logging out of your user account, and closing your web browser).</p>
        <p>ZeniMax maintains safeguards to protect the security, integrity and privacy of the personal information we collect. Personal information collected by ZeniMax is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and is only accessible by authorized employees. In addition, we utilize third-party websites to sell our products and they use industry-standard encryption to prevent unauthorized electronic access to sensitive financial information such as your credit card number.</p>
        <p>We also have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control (i.e., maintain data quality). Before we allow website users to access their personal information, for example, we verify their identity by prompting them to submit information such as their login name and password.</p>
        <p>We will retain your information for as long as permitted for legitimate business purposes. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy04@zenimax.com">privacy04@zenimax.com</a>.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
