            <p>THIS PAGE WAS REVISED AS OF June 30, 2009. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.</p>

            <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>The privacy of those who visit our web site is of primary concern to ELUXURY. We automatically gather some data from everyone who visits our site, while other information is obtained at the discretion of the individual. Our sole purpose in doing this is to enhance the experience of individuals on ELUXURY (for example, to tailor special offers to our users or to survey our users about their site experience). None of this information is shared with outside parties other than companies we employ to perform functions on our behalf, to which limited data is given as is necessary in order to maintain our relationship with you, such as to customize our communications with you, if you elect to receive communications.</p>


            <h3>Visit Information</h3>
            <p>Like many other internet companies, ELUXURY automatically tracks the usage of our web site. We profile web site usage by tracking the ELUXURY pages viewed, the previous and following sites visited, the browser used, and the computer's address. This information is used to analyze trends, track use, and optimize site administration. </p>


            <h3>Registration Information</h3>
            <p>In order to take advantage of our email communication services, a user must first complete the email registration page. During registration, users are required to give their email address. This information is used to contact users about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. You may opt-out of receiving communications from us at any time by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link in an email, emailing us at marketing@ELUXURY.com, or by writing us at: ELUXURY.com, Inc., One Market, Steuart Tower 4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105, ATTN: My Privacy. </p>



            <h3>Secured Information</h3>
            <p>ELUXURY takes numerous precautions to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, the information is protected both online and offline. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screensavers when they leave their desks. When they return, they must re-enter their password to regain access to user information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. </p>

            <p>ELUXURY may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information. </p>


            <h3>Communications</h3>
            <p>ELUXURY is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We also communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services. We reply to users' inquiries on issues relating to their account via email or phone, in accordance with the user's wishes. </p>

            <p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.</p>

            <p>We employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. </p>

            <p>After registration, users may opt-out of receiving email communications from ELUXURY by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link in an email, emailing us at marketing@EXLUXURY.com, or by writing us at: ELUXURY.com, Inc., One Market, Steuart Tower 4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105, ATTN: My Privacy. </p>

            <p>The ELUXURY site may have links to other web sites on the internet that are not owned or controlled by ELUXURY. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of these web sites, nor does this mean that ELUXURY endorses them in any way. </p>


            <h3>Correcting/Updating Information</h3>
            <p>If a user's email address changes, we provide a way to correct or update their email address. To change the email address to which you receive email communication, simply unsubscribe from an email using the “Unsubscribe” link on the email, and re-register with your new email address at http://www.eluxury.com/signup.</p>



            <h3>Disclosure to Authorities</h3>
            <p>ELUXURY cannot guarantee that all private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right and may be forced to disclose any and all information to government bodies or government officials or third parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Accordingly, you authorize ELUXURY to disclose any and all information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.</p>

            <p>Further, you authorize ELUXURY to disclose your email address as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, gray market, intellectual property infringement, piracy or other unlawful activity. Specifically, this includes exchanging such information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. ELUXURY cooperates with law enforcement inquiries and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property and other rights.</p>


            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>Cookies are small pieces of information sent from a web server to your computer. These allow us to personalize and customize your site experience without having to continually request the same basic information from you. </p>


            <h3>Other</h3>
            <p>If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users of this by email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if you have deleted/deactivated your account you will not be contacted, nor will your personal information be used in this new manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>
             
            <p>If you have any questions about the security or privacy at our web site, you can email us at marketing@ELUXURY.com or write to us at: ELUXURY.com, Inc., One Market, Steuart Tower 4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105, ATTN: My Privacy. </p>
