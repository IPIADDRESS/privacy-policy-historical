Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.  When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to their information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected.  Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.
