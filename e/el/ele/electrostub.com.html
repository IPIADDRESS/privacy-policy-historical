                <p>Effective Date of Current Policy: November 1, 2009</p>
                <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
                <p>Welcome to ElectroStub's Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we use and protect the personal information you decide to share with us. This Privacy Policy applies to all users of <a href="http://www.electrostub.com">www.electrostub.com</a> ("Website"), our products and services, and to any information provided to ElectroStub. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") does not pertain to information collected by third parties. ElectroStub cannot and does not assume responsibility for the policies, practices, and actions of such third parties. You are welcome to use as much of the Website as possible without providing any personally identifiable information to us, but you must nevertheless agree to all of the terms and conditions contained in this if you intend to continue to use the Website.</p>
                <p>Please read this Policy carefully. We will not share your personal information other than as described below. ElectroStub reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove provisions of its Policy, and any changes to the Policy will take effect when the revised Privacy Policy is posted to the Website, so please be sure to check our Website often. By using or accessing ElectroStub, you are accepting the practices described in this Policy without limitation, qualification, or change and do so at your own risk. If at any time you do not accept all the terms and conditions contained within this Policy, do not access ElectroStub's Website or use any of the products or services ElectroStub provides.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions, please click <a href="http://www.ticketmob.com/contact.cfm" target="_blank">here</a> for information on how to contact us.</p>
                <h2>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
                <p>There are two types of information ElectroStub collects, personal information and non-personal information. Personal information is information that identifies you such as your name and email address. Non-personal information does not identify you personally, but gives us information about your computer and about your activities on our Website, such as your IP address, browser type, the date and time you access the Website, the website that referred you to our Website, and so forth.</p>
                <h3>Personal Information</h3>
                <p>You may use many features of ElectroStub's Website without providing any personal information. However, in order to take advantage of all the services and products ElectroStub's Website provides, it may be necessary to furnish us with personal information such as, but not limited to, your: name, postal address, telephone number, fax number, geographic location, email address, age, gender, birth date, credit or debit card number or other payment account number and the applicable expiration date(s), comedic preferences, purchasing history and other identification and contact information. In addition, you may also be providing personal information when you submit comments on this Website. ElectroStub collects personal information when you voluntarily provide it. If you are a registered user of ElectroStub, we may retain your information as long as you maintain your registered status (and in certain cases described below, even after you are no longer a registered ElectroStub user).</p>
                <p>On occasion, ElectroStub may ask you some questions about yourself (such as your interests and activities, your age, etc.) so we know how to best serve you and to help ensure you are maximizing the products and services ElectroStub offers. However, you are under no obligation to answer these questions.</p>
                <h3>Non-Personal Information</h3>
                <p>In addition to the non-personal information described above, we and our service providers also collect and store information from your computer using "cookies." A cookie is a small file stored on your computer and is tied to information about you. For example, cookies enables ElectroStub to save your name email address so that the next time you access ElectroStub's Website from the same computer, ElectroStub will recognize your computer's browser as a previous visitor and will remember your name and email address when you sign on to your account. This makes your experience on ElectroStub easier, faster, and smoother. We do not set any personally identifiable information in cookies. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you should modify your browser preferences by deleting or declining cookies. (Click "Help" in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, please be advised that some of the features and services of ElectroStub's Website may not function properly.</p>
                <p>We also use a tracking cookie to analyze your activity with respect to advertising, searching and purchasing on the Website. You may choose to opt out with respect to the tracking cookie by visiting <a href="http://www.247realmedia.com/EN-US/opt-out.html">http://www.247realmedia.com/EN-US/opt-out.html</a></p>
                <p>We and our service providers may also use "web beacons," to track your use of ElectroStub's Website. A web beacon is similar in function to cookies. Web beacons also enable ElectroStub to provide you with an experience more tailored to your preferences and interest the next time you visit. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a specific identifier and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Web beacons differ from cookies in that the information is not stored on your hard drive, but are invisibly embedded on the web pages (or in email.) When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when an email has been opened. Web beacons do not contain any personal information.</p>
                <p>ElectroStub may also receive information about its users (such as purchase history and demographic information) from third parties, and we may allow third parties to display advertisements on our Website. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about people who view or interact with their advertisements on our Website. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and judge their effectiveness. ElectroStub does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on ElectroStub unless you choose to share it with them.</p>
                <h2>PROTECTING YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
                <p>We realize you value your information and so do we. Therefore, we have taken appropriate security procedures to help safeguard this information from unauthorized access and disclosure. We use data security systems to encrypt your personal and financial information to reduce the risk that your information will be obtained by unauthorized persons. We also encrypt credit card numbers and other sensitive information before it is sent from your computer to ours. We also use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized access to your personal information. Only authorized employees are permitted to access your personal information, and they may do so only for limited reasons. Our employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices, and the servers that store personal information are in a secure environment.</p>
                <p>We want you to feel confident using our Website to transact business. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you feel your information has been compromised in any way from the use of this Website, please contact us immediately. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has released a comprehensive guide that can help you guard against and deal with identity theft. This guide and other useful tools can be obtained by visiting the following website: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/</a> or by calling 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357); TT: 1-866-653-4261.

                <h2>HOW ELECTROSTUB SHARES YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
                <p>Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, we do not sell, trade, or rent your personally identifiable information collected on our Website to others.

We also share Website usage information we gather from visitors to our Website who have received a targeted promotional campaign with our third-party advertising service partner for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and our third-party service partners note some of the pages you visit on our Website through the use of clear GIFs</p>

Moreover, we may release account information (including, if necessary, your personally identifiable information) when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms of Service or to protect the rights, property and safety of our users, others and ourselves.</p>
                <p>In addition, we may share your personal information with:</p>
                <p><strong>Authorized service providers</strong>. Our authorized service providers are companies that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling ticket orders, processing credit card payments, delivering packages, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analyses, supporting our Website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features we offer. These service providers may have access to your personal information to the extent necessary to perform their functions, but we do not allow them to share or use any of your personal information for any other purpose.</p>
                <p><strong>Business partners</strong>. When you make a purchase or participate in a promotion, we may share your personal information with the business for which you purchase tickets and with merchants offering the products, services, promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes.

                <h2>THIRD PARTY USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
                <p>There are a number of places on our Website where you may click on a link to access other websites that don't operate under this Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement on our Website, you may be taken to a website that we don't control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you. Importantly, these third parties will have their own privacy policies describing how they use and disclose your personal information. Those policies will govern the use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once you or we have shared it with those third parties. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. These other sites may send their own cookies or clear GIFs to users, collect data or solicit personally identifiable information. Additionally, other companies which place advertising on our Website may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies or clear GIFs. We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect. If you want to learn more about other entities' privacy practices, please review the websites of those third parties. Privacy policies are typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting. If you have any questions about how a third party handles personal information, please contact that third party directly.</p>
                <h2>BLOGS, BULLETIN BOARDS, REVIEWS AND CHAT ROOMS</h2>
                <p>We may provide areas on our Website where you can post information about yourself, communicate with others, post reviews or upload content (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.). Such postings are governed by our Terms of Service, so be sure to review them before posting. In addition, keep in mind that postings may appear on other websites or when searches are conducted on search engines on the subject of your posting.</p>
                <p>Also, whenever you disclose personal information publicly (such as on publicly viewable web pages), that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited email messages. We can't control who reads your posting or what others may do with information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to use your discretion with respect to posting personal information. Finally, please be advised that that any information or content that you have posted to public areas of the Website (which may include comments, ratings, reviews, photographs or images) will remain on the Website for the benefits of other users irrespective of the status of your user account. The modification or deletion of your personal information from our database will not cause the removal of any content you had previously provided to the Website.</p>

                <p>Even if you have unsubscribed from receiving promotional emails from us, we may send you other types of important e-mail communications without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. These may include customer service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys.</p>
                <p>Please note that changing information in your My Account page or opting out of receiving promotional email communications will affect only future communications from us.
