		<p>The following Privacy Policy summarizes the various ways that  Elements Therapeutic Massage, Inc. ("we," "our" or us) treats the  information you provide while using www.touchofelements.com ("Website").   It is our goal to bring you information that is tailored to your  individual needs and, at the same time, protect your privacy.</p> <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of and/or  registration on any aspect of the Website will constitute your  agreement to this Privacy Policy.  If you cannot agree with the terms  and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website.   This Privacy Policy does not cover information collected elsewhere,  including, without limitation, information you provide to other sites to  which you link from the Website.  In addition to reviewing this Privacy  Policy, please read our Agreement and Terms of Use, as your use of this  Website constitutes your agreement to our terms and conditions as well.</p> <p>This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; the  date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page, so check  back often.  Continued access of the Website by you will constitute your  acceptance of any changes or revisions to the Privacy Policy.</p> <p>MESSAGE TO PARENTS AND KIDS: This Website is not intended for  use by children, especially those under age 13.  No one under age 13 is  allowed to provide any personal information.  Minors between the ages  of 13 and 17 must get the permission of their parent(s) or legal  guardian(s) before making any purchases or registering on this site.  If  your children disclose information about themselves on this Website,  they may get unsolicited messages from other parties.  Accordingly, you  should tell them not to do so.  If you're worried about your children's  activities or their privacy on our Website, we encourage you to contact  our Legal Department as described below.</p> <h2>1. What information does the Website collect?</h2> <p>We may ask you to provide us with personally identifiable  information about yourself at various times and at various places on the  Website, such as when you establish an online account, purchase  products, services or gift cards, or contact one of our representatives  through the Website.  You are asked to provide information such as your  e-mail address, physical address, name, phone number and credit card  information, as well as information on your family members. Optional  information such as demographic information or information regarding  your interests or hobbies may also be requested.  In addition, as part  of our current and planned services, we may, at any time, include  features to this Website that require you to register or otherwise  provide personally identifiable information, including credit card  information, or we may require registration or a membership fee to gain  access to any portion of this Website.  If you've registered on any part  of the Website, please use the mechanism on the Website that allows you  to change or update your preferences or information, if available, to  keep all such data accurate and up-to-date.</p> <p>Our servers may also automatically collect information about  your computer when you visit the Website, including, without limitation,  the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are  running, the website that referred you, and your Internet Protocol  ("IP") address.  Your IP address is usually associated with the place  from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider,  your employer or your educational institution.  We may also collect  Website usage information that describes how our visitors use and  navigate this Website, and it includes the number and frequency of  visitors to each web page and the length of their stays.</p> <h2>2. How do we use your information?</h2> <p>We use personally identifying information you supply through  the Website to provide you with the service or product you have  requested.  For example, if you request an appointment at a certain  location, we may use your e-mail address or mailing address to confirm  your appointment and send you special offers.  Similarly, if you sign up  for special promotions, we will use this information to provide such  promotional information.  We may also use the information to communicate  with you about new features, products or services, and/or to improve  the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs.  In the  unlikely event that you decide you no longer want to receive e-mail  communications from us, just click the "Unsubscribe" link that's  prominently displayed at the bottom of each e-mail, or you may contact  our Legal Department as described below.</p> <p>Unless otherwise specified on the Website, we may sell or  share personally identifying information with our affiliates and with  carefully selected companies who we think can offer you services and  products of interest to you. If you do not wish to have your personally  identifying information shared, e-mail us at  marketing.support@touchofelements.com.</p> <p>We also allow access to our database by third parties that  provide us with services, such as technical maintenance or chat forums,  but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those  services.  If you choose to purchase items through features on the  Website, we may forward your information to third parties for services  such as credit card processing and order fulfillment.  There are also  times when you provide information about yourself to us in areas of the  Website that may be managed or participated in by third parties, such as  our shopping cart. In such cases, the information may be used by us and  by such third party(ies), each pursuant to its own policies.  We may  also provide your information to certain advertisers, and these  companies may send ads to you that meet your needs or match your  interests, including ads from us.  While we will seek to require such  third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not  authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose  for which it is provided, we do not bear any responsibility for any  actions or policies of third parties.</p> <p>We may also provide access to our database in order to  cooperate with official investigations or legal proceedings, including,  for example, in response to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or  other legal process.  In addition, we reserve the right to use the  information we collect about your computer, which may at times be able  to identify you, for any lawful business purpose, including without  limitation to help diagnose problems with our servers, to gather broad  demographic information, and to otherwise administer our Website.</p> <p>While your personally identifying information is protected as  outlined above, we reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share  aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business  purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible  advertisers and strategic business partners.  We may share your data  with our franchise owners and area directors, our shareholders,  creditors, investors, board of directors, employees, agents and  representatives working on our behalf, our legal, financial and other  professional advisors, third party market research companies,  advertising and marketing agencies and consultants, website development  companies, direct mail companies and other companies with whom we do  business.  However, we will not share or authorize the sharing of your  credit card information to any third party unless required to process  your purchase on our Website.</p> <p>In addition, as our business changes, we may buy or sell  various assets. In the event all or a portion of the assets owned or  controlled by us, our parent or any subsidiary or affiliated entity are  sold, assigned, transferred or acquired by another company, the  information from and/or about our Website users may be among the  transferred assets.</p> <h2>3. What are "cookies" and how does this Website use them?</h2> <p>You may have read about "cookies," nuggets of information  that are placed by a Website in a storage place on your own computer. We  may use cookies to control the display of ads, to track usage patterns  on the site and to record registration and personalization information.  For example, if you register on any part of the Website and are given  the option to save your user name and password on your computer, we can  provide this convenience to you by placing a cookie on your computer.  Our cookies may contain personally identifiable information and such  cookies may be shared with our affiliates and other companies as  described above.</p> <h2>4. Is your information secure?</h2> <p>We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards  designed to protect personal information.  Our client relationship  management software employs encryption technologies and user  authentication procedures that are designed to keep your data secure.  However, because no data transmission over the Internet is completely  secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is  impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of the information you  send to us or the security of our servers or databases, and by using the  Website, you agree to assume all risk in connection with the  information sent to us or collected by us when you use the Website. In  the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your information  in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to  notify you. If notification is appropriate, we may notify you by e-mail  (provided we have your e-mail address).</p> <h2>5. Who should you contact if you have questions or concerns?</h2> <p>If you have any concerns or questions about any aspect of  this policy, please feel free to contact our Legal Department as  follows:</p> <p>Elements Therapeutic Massage, Inc.<br> Legal Department<br> 9092 Ridgeline Blvd, STE A<br> Highlands Ranch, CO 80129</p>	</div>
