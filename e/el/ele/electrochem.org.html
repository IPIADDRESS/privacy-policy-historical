      <p class="Body">The data collected online from an ECS user is voluntary, 
        although some services are only accessible by registering user details. 
        Information collected may include your name, e-mail address, street address, 
        job title, society membership, or other related demographic information. 
        Except as described in this Privacy Policy, ECS will endeavor to keep 
        your information confidential. We focus on using the information as part 
        of ECS's service to you and its mission to advance the knowledge of electrochemical 
        and solid-state science and technology. </p>
      <p class="Body"><b><font color="#660000">Notice to EU Users</font></b> <br>
        The server for www.electrochem.org is located in the United States. By 
        entering information on this site, you are consenting to the transfer 
        of that information to the United States. Your information will be handled 
        in accordance with the ECS Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p class="style12" align="left"><span class="Body"><b><font color="#660000">How 
        collected information is used</font></b> <br>
        The primary purpose of gathering information is to allow ECS to link a 
        name and contact information to a user ID or browsing experience. Once 
        you have provided appropriate information, you will be enabled to use 
        a variety of products or personalized services, and to access online help 
        or support. ECS has a policy to use or sell its customer lists only for 
        the delivery of information deemed of potential relevance or interest 
        to members of the physics community. ECS offers an option to remove your 
        information from any list that might be sold or given to another organization. 
        </span></p>
      <p class="style12" align="left"> <span class="Body"><b><font color="#660000">How 
        we work to keep information secure</font> </b><br>
        ECS takes precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive 
        information via the website, we make commercially reasonable efforts to 
        protect your information both online and off-line. When our registration/order 
        form asks for sensitive information (such as a credit card number), we 
        use dedicated software designed to encrypt the information and protect 
        it. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the 
        bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet 
        Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are 
        just 'surfing'. </span></p>
      <p class="style12" align="left"><span class="Body"><b><font color="#660000">Opt-out 
        for European Union and other users</font> </b><br>
        In accordance with EU and other guidelines, you may decline to provide 
        the information requested by ECS. Please be advised, however, that ECS 
        may be unable to provide certain services unless such information is provided 
        for security and identification purposes.</span></p>
      <p class="style12" align="left"><span class="Body"><b><font color="#660000">Cookies</font></b> 
        <br>
        A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive that sometimes 
        links to personally identifiable information about the user. ECS occasionally 
        uses session cookies which are designed not to be permanent or persistent. 
        The session cookie is designed so that, once you close your browser, the 
        cookie will simply terminate. If you configure your browser to reject 
        cookies, you may still use some, but not all, portions of our site. For 
        example, accessing our online journals requires that your browser accept 
        cookies. We recommend closing browsers on publicly available machines 
        (such as those in libraries) after use. </span></p>
      <p class="style12" align="left"><span class="Body"><b><font color="#660000">Disclosure 
        of aggregated and other information</font></b> <br>
        We use IP addresses and other user information to analyze trends, administer 
        the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information 
        for aggregate use. We may share aggregated (i.e., non-individual) demographic 
        information with our partners and advertisers. We use one or more outside 
        credit card processing companies to bill users for goods and services 
        and we will disclose your personally identifiable information to these 
        companies as needed to process your orders and to respond to your requests</span></p>
      <p class="style12" align="left"><span class="Body"><b><font color="#660000">Links</font></b> 
        <br>
        ECS sites contains links to other sites, and other sites have links to 
        ECS. Please be aware that ECS is not responsible for the privacy practices 
        (or other practices, goods, services, or content) of other sites. We encourage 
        you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements 
        of each web site that collects personally identifiable information. This 
        privacy statement applies solely to information collected by ECS. </span></p>
      <p class="style12" align="left"><span class="Body"><b><font color="#660000">Notification 
        of changes</font></b> <br>
        If we make material changes to our privacy policy, these changes will 
        be posted to our privacy policy page. You should review this page regularly 
        for updates.</span></p>
