          By accepting of the terms and conditions of this website (and any associated offers, contests, giveaways or other programs), and providing your telephone number, you are subscribing to a free Special Offer Service
          ("SOS").  SOS subscribers receive pre-recorded telephone messages regarding various special product offers and purchase incentives, and are also automatically entered into various contests and sweepstakes whenever they receive such calls.  The service is free of charge.  For more information regarding the SOS and its associated sweepstakes and contests, including applicable rules, please visit www.specialofferservice.com.<br>
          <br>
          By subscribing, such act constitutes your express written consent to be contacted by Worldwide Commerce Associates
          ("WCA") via prerecorded telephone message for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR
          310 et seq.), and the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (15 USC
          96), as amended from time to time.  The calls you are agreeing to receive describe goods and services offered by third parties through the SOS, and any goods or services described in the call are not sold by or through WCA.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          You are subscribing to receive calls only from WCA, and only at the specific number(s) you have provided to us. Your consent will be effective if the number you have provided is a home, business, or cell phone line, or if the number is registered on any state or federal Do-Not-Call (DNC) list as of the date of this consent.   WCA reserves the right to refrain from calling any number registered on a DNC list in connection with any promotions. This consent shall remain in effect until you revoke your consent and cancel your subscription.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          To unsubscribe:  You may cancel your SOS subscription and revoke your consent to receive calls at any time by either (a) utilizing the opt-out procedure included in any message you receive; (b) by sending an e-mail that includes your telephone number to optout@specialofferservice.com; (c) by calling 800-269-0281; or (d) by sending a written request to Worldwide Commerce Associates, 7251 West Lake Boulevard, Suite 300, Las Vegas, NV 89128.

Some information may be retained for longer periods as required by law, contract or auditing requirements.
