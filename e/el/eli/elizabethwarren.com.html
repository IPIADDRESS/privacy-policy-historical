		<p><strong>Last Revised: September 28, 2011</strong></p>
<p>This website is operated by Elizabeth for MA ("EFM", "we" or "us").  This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by EFM with respect to your use of the www.elizabethwarren.com Web site and other Elizabeth for MA Web and mobile sites which display this Policy (the "Sites") so you can make an informed decision about using the Sites.  This Policy also applies to personal information collected on other web sites and mobile sites on our behalf by third party vendors.  We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated.  We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.</p>
<p><strong>What Is Personal Information?</strong></p>
<p>As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or credit card number) and information about that individual or his or her activities that is directly linked to personally identifiable information.  Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Sites or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed.  This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>
<p><strong>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>
<p><em>Active Collection:</em> Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit our Sites.  We collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us, such as when you create an account or a profile, make a donation, make a purchase, send us an email or sign up to receive email or text message updates, fill out a form, connect through a social feed, sign up to be a volunteer or host an event, request information, apply for an internship, or use a Voter Registration Form tool.  Such information may include personal information, such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, and credit card information.  Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with creating a profile or group, leaving comments, posting blog comments or other content, sending an email or message to another user, or participating in any interactive forums or features on the Sites.  In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, contests, games, promotions, and other activities on the Sites.</p>
<p>In addition, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) may require us to collect personal information from donors.  For example, the FEC requires us to collect (and disclose) the name, mailing address, occupation, and employer of all individuals whose donations exceed $200 per calendar year.</p>
<p>If we add a Voter Registration tool and you use it, you may also provide your driver's license number, your social security number or the last four digits of your social security number, but that information would be deleted after the form is printed, so we would not retain it.</p>
<p><em>Passive Collection:</em> When you use the Sites, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and your activity on our Sites. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.</p>
<p>We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies" or web beacons.  Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website.  Among other things, cookies help us improve our Sites and your experience.  Information obtained from cookies and linked to personally identifying information is treated as personal information.  If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions.  When you view a video on our Sites, a third party may also set a "flash cookie" on your computer.  Removing and rejecting browser cookies does not necessarily affect third party flash cookies used in connection with our Sites.  To delete or disable flash cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security</a> for more information. However, if you choose to remove or reject browser or flash cookies, this could affect certain features on our Sites.  Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Sites or in emails relating to the Sites to collect certain information about usage and campaign effectiveness and monitor user activity on the Sites.</p>
<p><em>Collection By Third Parties:</em> Third party vendors may use cookies or other technologies to serve ads on other websites based on your visits to this site and other sites on the Internet. These third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Site.  They do this by using cookies, clear gifs or other technologies.  Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising on other websites targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Sites and the other sites tracked by these third parties.  This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or clear gifs used by the third parties, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology. If you would like to opt out of these cookies or obtain more information related to third party advertising networks, click here: http://www.networkadvertising.org.  In some cases, third party vendors may collect personal information from you, such as your name and email address, on other web sites and provide this information to us, or EFM may collect personal information that you enter directly within an advertising unit. This Policy does apply to such personal information collected online in this manner, and we will treat such information in the same manner as information collected on our Sites.</p>

<ul>
<li>with vendors, consultants, and other service providers or volunteers who are engaged by or working with us and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us; </li>
<li>with candidates, organizations, groups or causes that we believe have similar political viewpoints, principles or objectives; </li>
<li>to report required information to the Federal Elections Commission, including name, mailing address, occupation, and name of employers of individuals whose contributions exceed $200 in a calendar year (for additional information, visit the FEC website at <a target="_blank">http://www.fec.gov</a>); </li>
<li>when you give us your consent to do so, including if we notify you on the Sites, that the information you provide will be shared in a particular  manner and you provide such information; </li>
<li>when we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or legal processes or respond to lawful requests, claims or legal authorities, including responding to lawful subpoenas, warrants, or court orders; </li>
<li>when we believe in good faith that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to respond to claims or to protect the rights, property, or safety of EFM, our users, our employees, our volunteers, copyright owners, third parties or the public, including without limitation to protect such parties from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate, or unlawful activity or use of our Site; </li>
<li>to enforce or apply this Policy, our Terms of Service, or our other policies or agreements; and </li>
<li>in connection with, or during negotiations of, any reorganization, formation of new committee, asset sale or transfer, financing or lending transaction or in any other situation where personal information may be disclosed or transferred as one of the assets of EFM. </li>

<p>The Sites may use social plugins ("Plugins"), which lets friends share actions they take across web sites (e.g. the Facebook "Like" button).  Plugins are generally identifiable by the logo for the applicable social network or other notice indicating the use of a Plugin.

If you are logged into the applicable social network, your visit can be assigned to the account of such social network. If you interact with the Plugins, for example by clicking "Like," or entering a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to the social network providing the Plugin and is stored by it.  Even if you are not logged into that social network, there is possibility that the Plugins transmit certain information, such as your IP-address, to the applicable social networks.  For information on the purpose and scope of data collection and processing by such social networks, as well as your rights in this respect and settings options for protecting your privacy please visit the privacy policy page for the social network providing the Plugin.  If you do not want the social networks providing the Plugins to connect the data concerning your visit to our website with your member data already stored by such social networks, you must log off all such social networks before entering our website.  Simply closing the social network page does not suffice.</p>

We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with personal information.</p>
