We may, in our sole discretion, provide information about you to law enforcement or other government officials for purposes of fraud investigations, alleged intellectual property infringement, or any other suspected illegal activity or matters that may expose us to legal liability.</p>
<p>
Some government intelligence agencies have the technological ability to access data from our website without our cooperation, knowledge, or consent.

They are not allowed to sell or give your information to others.</p>
<p>
If we sell our website, we may transfer your information to the purchaser of the site. Upon completion of such a transfer, we will no longer possess or control the data received by the purchaser.</p>
