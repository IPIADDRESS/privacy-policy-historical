                    context of specific Services. This processing is strictly necessary for providing certain Services (and,
                    in some cases, is the service itself) and is not covered by consent. Other automated processing is not
                    significant either due to the nature of the data or the decisions being made or recommended, and so consent
                    is not required. However, for automated processing that is significant and related to sensitive Personal
                    Data, prior to sharing or using such data, Viral Launch will first seek your consent. For the subset
                    of automated processing included in ad profiling for ad targeting, you can change your consent status
                    (for Website Services) by disabling advertising cookies.

                <span class="c3">Interest-based advertising is advertising that is targeted to you based on your web browsing and Internet
                    usage over time and across our website. Viral Launch’s advertising practices also include the creation
                    and use of “audience segments”. You have the option to restrict the use of information for
                    interest-based advertising and to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads. You may also be asked to consent
                    to our use of cookies, including advertising cookies. Additional information choices for interest-based
                    advertising is found below. For all of the interest-based advertising described, you have the choice
                    to not have your data used to target and serve you interest-based advertising—including third party
                    advertising—regardless of where such ads might be served. These opt-outs require that strictly
                    necessary cookies are not blocked by the settings in your web browser. If you live in the United States,
                    Canada, or the European Union, you can visit Ad Choices (US), Your Ad Choices (Canada), or Your Online
                    Choices (EU) for more information regarding opting-out of interest-based advertising with participating
                    entities for each region. The website also provides detailed information about how interest-based advertising
                    works. Opting-out does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising from us, or when you use
                    the Internet; rather, it means that the data collected from the Website will not be used for interest-based
                    advertising and that the advertising you see displayed on the website will not be customized to your

                    for purposes of analytics, security and anti-fraud purposes, interest-based advertising, ad targeting,

                    network’s members to that social network, even when a button is not clicked. These technologies
                    may allow a social network (e.g., Facebook, Twitter or YouTube) to personally identify its members and
                    to know the web pages its members have visited. This is the case where social network buttons are embedded,
                    regardless of whether a button is “clicked”, “pressed” or “selected”.
                    If you belong to a social network or use these categories of web services, you should review the privacy
                    policies of those services to understand the nature of the data that they collect and what, if any, options
                    the service offers to control how data is collected and used. If you disable advertising cookies, the
                    passive tracking associated with these buttons will be blocked on our sites.</span>

                    are part of your device hardware, such as WiFi address and serial number. Exactly which Device IDs are

                    Launch’s Services may also collect Device IDs and network addresses (including IP addresses, MAC
