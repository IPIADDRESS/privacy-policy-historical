<p class="b"> <span class="hl">Information About You</span> <br>
  We collect several types of information on our Site. We collect "Personal 
  Information", which generally speaking is information that can be used 
  to identify you individually, such as your name and address. We also collect 
  "Non-personal Information", which is information about you that does 
  not itself identify you individually. Examples of Non-personal Information include 
  age range and gender. We also collect "Aggregate Information", which 
  is information about use of our site, such as pages visited on our Site. The 
  information we collect depends on what services you use on our Site. The following 
  is a more detailed explanation of these types of information as well as when 
  and how we collect and use it.</p>
<p class="b"><span class="hl">Personal and Non-Personal Information </span><br>
  Registration and Transactional Data. When you register on our Site, we may collect and store  information 
  related to your account including user name and user password. When you make 
  purchases from our Site, we may collect purchasing information such as product 
  orders, shipping address(es), and credit card information.</p>
<p class="b"><span class="hl">Surveys </span><br>
  From time-to-time we may post surveys on our Site. The surveys may request demographic 
  information (such as age range, gender, areas of interest, and familiarity with 
  Elite Trader content, products and services) and customer feedback. Participation 
  in these requests is completely voluntary and with each request you will have 
  the choice of whether or not to disclose information. Such survey information 
  will be used to improve the overall experience on EliteTrader.com.</p>

<p class="b"><span class="hl">Customer Service Correspondence </span><br>
  We may collect information that identifies you personally when you submit comments, 
  questions or suggestions to our Customer Service department.</p>
<p class="b"><span class="hl">Interactivity </span><br>
  Our Site may have chat rooms, discussion boards, rating systems and other interactive 
  technologies that allow individual comments and messages to be tied to a guest's 
  name or e-mail address. Any information you post in such forums is public information 
  and Elite Trader cannot control what uses third parties may make of personal 
  information you share in such forums. </p>
<p class="b"><span class="hl">Private Messaging  </span><br>
  Your account will allow you to access our "Private Messaging" system. Although this system allows you to contact other members directly without your messages being publicly viewable by all site visitors, your private messages are openly accessible to Administrators of our site. Your private messages may be accessed at any time for the purposes of site administration, legal inquiries, or investigating your account for violations of our <a href="/conduct_rules.cfm">member conduct rules</a>. </p>
<p class="b"><span class="hl">Resumes </span>If you are interested in applying for 
  a job with Elite Trader, we may collect your resume. Resumes you submit for 
  job applications will not be used for marketing purposes.</p>

 <p class="b"><span class="hl">Use of Your Personal and Non-Personal Information 
  </span>Except as disclosed in this policy, we do not sell information 
  that identifies our guests personally or makes it possible for other parties 
  to contact them directly without our guests' consent. We may use, sell, disclose, 
  or otherwise dispose of Personal Information we collect in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul class="b">
  <li> <b>Internal Analysis and Promotions.</b> We may use information about you 
    for our own internal statistical, design, operational purposes such as to 
    estimate our audience size; measure aggregate traffic patterns; and understand 
    demographic, customer interest, purchasing and other trends among our guests 
    and customers. We may also use your Personal Information for the marketing 
    and/or promotion of our products or services. We may outsource all of these 
    tasks to third parties on a confidential basis. If you do not want to receive 
    our promotional materials, <a href="http://www.elitetrader.com/vb/member.php?action=editprofile">click here</a> to change 
    your preference settings.<br>
    <br>
  </li><li><b>Transaction Processing.</b> We may use your Personal Information to create 
    a convenient and easy-to-use shopping process that includes an online "shopping 
    cart" that allows you to track selected products and proceed through 
    purchase.<br>
    <br>
  </li><li><b>Legal Requirement.</b> We may disclose personal information if required 
    to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary 
    to: 
    <ol class="b">
      <li>conform with the law, respond to claims or comply with legal inquiries about  
        the content of your posts;<br>
      </li><li> protect and defend our rights or property, the Site, our employees, 
        guests or the public.<br>
        <br>
    </li></ol>
  </li><li><b>Company Sale.</b> Information collected through our Site is considered 
    a trade secret of Elite Trader. As the owner of such information, we may disclose 
    or sell such information as an asset of the company in conjunction with the 
    sale to a third party of our company or a portion of our assets. 
</li></ul>
  
<p class="b"><span class="hl">Aggregate Information </span><br>
  We collect Aggregate Information about you and your use of our Site whenever 
  you visit us online. For instance, we may collect various forms of "click 
  stream" information such as entry and exit points for our Site (i.e., referring 
  URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, and operating 
  system and browser type. In addition, when users request pages on our Site, 
  our servers may log their IP addresses. An IP address is a number 
  that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the 
  Web.</p>

    
<p class="b">We also use third-party software that tracks traffic directed to 
  EliteTrader.com from affiliate Web sites and the purchases that result from 
  this traffic. This information is aggregated and is not tied to an individual 
  purchase.</p>

   <p class="b"> This Aggregate Information generally will not personally identify you or be 
    correlated to you individually for external purposes. We may collect, compile, 
    store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and 
    all Aggregate Information, provided that, such information does not personally 
    identify you. When we share such information with other companies, it is not 
    traceable to any particular user, and will not be used to contact you. If 
    we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, such information will be 
    treated like any other personal identifying information under this policy.</p>

    
<p class="b"><span class="hl">Cookies </span><br>
  We make use of "cookies" on our Site. Cookies are small text files 
  that are stored on a user's computer by a Web server based on the permissions 
  set in a user's browser software. A cookie itself is not designed or intended 
  to read any information from a user's computer (other than the contents of the 
  cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the Web site that originally placed 
  it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be 
  retrieved by the same server to identify the computer and subsequently to customize, 
  monitor, or regulate the use of a site based on information stored on the host 
  server. Therefore, cookies only identify the user's computer to the Web site 
  which may correlate other information, including personally identifying information, 
  with the cookie.</p>

    <p class="b">We use cookies to allow us to automate access and data entry functions of 
    our Site such as login information, correlate online ordering information 
    for purchases you may make while at the Site (if any), tailor the Site to 
    your preferences or interests, or customize promotions or marketing. In addition, 
    cookies allow us to track use of the Site to determine those areas which are 
    useful or popular and those that are not thereby enabling us to improve and 
    update the Site effectively.</p>

   <p class="b">You may adjust your Web browsers to either alert you of the use of cookies 
    or refuse to accept cookies entirely. For Internet Explorer or AOL users, 
    you can click on the "Start" button and then select Control Panel, 
    Internet Options and the Security tab. If you click on the "Custom" 
    button, you will be able to see the cookie options. For Netscape users, in 
    the browser, select File, Preferences and then Advanced to view the cookie 
    options. Be aware that if you elect not to accept cookies, some parts of the 
    Site may not function properly or permit access.</p>

    
<p class="b"><span class="hl">Links to Other Sites </span><br>
  Please be aware that we provide links to third-party Web sites as a service 
  to our guests, and that we are not responsible for the content or information 
  collection practices of those pages. Please note that these Web sites' privacy 
  policies may differ from those of Elite Trader. We encourage your to review 
  and understand their privacy practices before providing them with information.</p>

    
<p class="b"><span class="hl">Children </span><br>
  Our Site is a niche site for adults that is not designed nor intended to collect 
  personal information from children under the age of 13. To respect the privacy 
  of children and to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 
  children under the age of 13 should not provide any Personal Information on 
  this Site. We ask that parents supervise their children while online.</p>

    
<p class="b"><span class="hl">Security </span><br>
  We use commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain Personal Information 
  to protect it from loss, misuse, alternation or destruction by any unauthorized 
  party:</p>
<ul class="b">
<li>We encrypt order information, including credit card numbers, 
    using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that our customers' 
    information is safe as it is sent over the Internet to our server. 
</li><li>Guest registration 
    data can be accessed only with a valid guest name and password (which the 
    guest selects during registration), or by authorized personnel within Elite 
    Trader. Therefore, you should not disclose your guest name or password to 
    any unauthorized third parties. If your password is compromised, you should 
    access your account and change your password immediately.
