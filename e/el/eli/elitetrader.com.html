  <p class="b">This online privacy policy tells you about the information Elite Trader collects 
  through the services available on our web site, EliteTrader.com (the "Site"), 
  how we use that information and how you can opt out of certain uses of information 
  we may collect. By using our services and accessing our Site, you are consenting 
  to the information collection and use practices described in this policy, as 
  modified from time to time by us. If we decide to change our privacy policy, 
  we will post a new policy on our Site and change the date at the top of the 
  policy. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of our privacy policy 
  whenever you visit this Site for any updates or changes. Please see our <a href="http://www2.elitetrader.com/legal.cfm">Terms of Use</a> for a more detailed 
  legal explanation of our general online policies.</p>
<p class="b"> If you have any questions about our privacy policy or our use of

<p class="b"> <span class="hl">Information About You</span> <br>
  We collect several types of information on our Site. We collect "Personal 
  Information", which generally speaking is information that can be used 
  to identify you individually, such as your name and address. We also collect 
  "Non-personal Information", which is information about you that does 
  not itself identify you individually. Examples of Non-personal Information include 
  age range and gender. We also collect "Aggregate Information", which 
  is information about use of our site, such as pages visited on our Site. The 
  information we collect depends on what services you use on our Site. The following 
  is a more detailed explanation of these types of information as well as when 
  and how we collect and use it.</p>
<p class="b"><span class="hl">Personal and Non-Personal Information </span><br>
  Registration and Transactional Data. When you register on our Site, we may collect 
  various kinds of Personal Information including your name, e-mail address, home 
  address, and home phone number. We also collect and store access information 
  related to your account including guest name and user password. When you make 
  purchases from our Site, we may collect purchasing information such as product 
  orders, shipping address(es), and credit card information.</p>

  From time-to-time we may post surveys on our Site. The surveys may request demographic 
  information (such as age range, gender, areas of interest, and familiarity with 
  Elite Trader content, products and services) and customer feedback. Participation 
  in these requests is completely voluntary and with each request you will have 
  the choice of whether or not to disclose information. Such survey information

  questions or suggestions to our Customer Service department.</p>
<p class="b"><span class="hl">Interactivity </span><br>
  Our Site may have chat rooms, discussion boards, rating systems and other interactive 
  technologies that allow individual comments and messages to be tied to a guest's 
  name or e-mail address. Any information you post in such forums is public information 
  and Elite Trader cannot control what uses third parties may make of personal 
  information you share in such forums.</p>

</li></ul>
  
<p class="b"><span class="hl">Aggregate Information </span><br>

  URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, and operating 
  system and browser type. In addition, when users request pages on our Site,

    store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and 
    all Aggregate Information, provided that, such information does not personally 
    identify you. When we share such information with other companies, it is not 
    traceable to any particular user, and will not be used to contact you. If 
    we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, such information will be 
    treated like any other personal identifying information under this policy.</p>

    
<p class="b"><span class="hl">Cookies </span><br>
  We make use of "cookies" on our Site. Cookies are small text files 
  that are stored on a user's computer by a Web server based on the permissions 
  set in a user's browser software. A cookie itself is not designed or intended 
  to read any information from a user's computer (other than the contents of the 
  cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the Web site that originally placed 
  it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be 
  retrieved by the same server to identify the computer and subsequently to customize, 
  monitor, or regulate the use of a site based on information stored on the host 
  server. Therefore, cookies only identify the user's computer to the Web site 
  which may correlate other information, including personally identifying information, 
  with the cookie.</p>

    <p class="b">We use cookies to allow us to automate access and data entry functions of 
    our Site such as login information, correlate online ordering information 
    for purchases you may make while at the Site (if any), tailor the Site to 
    your preferences or interests, or customize promotions or marketing. In addition, 
    cookies allow us to track use of the Site to determine those areas which are 
    useful or popular and those that are not thereby enabling us to improve and 
    update the Site effectively.</p>

   <p class="b">You may adjust your Web browsers to either alert you of the use of cookies 
    or refuse to accept cookies entirely. For Internet Explorer or AOL users, 
    you can click on the "Start" button and then select Control Panel, 
    Internet Options and the Security tab. If you click on the "Custom" 
    button, you will be able to see the cookie options. For Netscape users, in 
    the browser, select File, Preferences and then Advanced to view the cookie 
    options. Be aware that if you elect not to accept cookies, some parts of the
