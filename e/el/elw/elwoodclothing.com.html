<h4>Our visitors - Automatic Data Collection</h4>
<p>Like most websites,Elwood.com collects non-personally-identifying   information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available,   such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and   time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally   identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use this   website. From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying   information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the   usage of this website.</p>
<p>Elwood also collects potentially personally-identifying information   like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We do not use such information to   identify our visitors, however, and do not disclose such information, other than   under the same circumstances that we use and disclose personally-identifying   information, as described below.</p>
<h4>Our customers - Information You Provide to Us</h4>
<p>Certain actions on our website do require us to collect   personally-indentifying information. Purchasers are asked to provide additional   information, including as necessary the personal and financial information   required to process transactions. In each case, Elwood collects such   information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose   of the visitor's interaction with our company.
