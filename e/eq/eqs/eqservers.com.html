    <p><strong>BY SIGNING UP FOR AN Eqservers LLC (THE “COMPANY”) ACCOUNT AND/OR USING ITS PRODUCTS, SERVICES, WEBSITES AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. ANY USER’S USE OR CONTINUED USE OF THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS, SERVICES, WEBSITES OR MOBILE APPLICATIONS CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</strong>
	
</p><p><br>If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please feel free to contact us by e-mail, at Privacy [at] eqservers.com</p>
<p><br>In connection with serving content and providing analytics and advertising services, third parties may collect certain information about your visits to this and other websites and we may receive information regarding the use of the Site and the effectiveness of our advertisements. These advertising networks, advertisers, advertising agencies, analytics service providers, and other vendors may set and access their own tracking technologies (including cookies and web beacons) and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you and your online browsing activities.</p>

<p><br>The Site is operated in the United States. If you are located outside the United States and use the Site or provide us with any information, you consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of your information in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside or are a citizen.</p>
	<br>
	<div class="mainHeading"><h1>Information We Collect</h1></div>
	<div class="mainHeading"><h3>Information You Provide to the Site</h3></div>
	<p><br>Eqservers may ask you to provide “Personal Information” (information that identifies you as a specific individual, such as, but not limited to, your name or e-mail address and other contact information), and information necessary to facilitate financial transactions between Eqservers and you (such as, but not limited to, financial account numbers). We may also collect demographic information (such as, but not limited to, your age, occupation, postal code, or similar information), certain information about your preferences and interests, customer questions and support information, and other information collected through surveys, chat features, and polls made available on the Site. If we combine these types of other information about you with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.

The Site does not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children younger than the age of thirteen (13), If we become aware that personal information from a child under the age of 13 has been collected, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.</p>
	<br>
	<div class="mainHeading"><h3>Information Third Parties Provide About You</h3></div>
	<p><br>We may also receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you are on another website that provides information about hosting service providers like Eqservers and you request to receive information from Eqservers, that website will forward your contact and other information to us so that we may contact you as requested. Third parties may also provide information about you in connection with a marketing arrangement we may have with those third parties.

</p><p><br>We also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with the information, goods, or services you have requested to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other outside sources with information we collect through the Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.</p>

</p><p><br>We may use Site Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including enhancing or otherwise improving the Site and our products and services. We may associate Site Usage Information with you as a specific and identifiable person. When we do so, we treat the combined information as Personal Information.</p>
