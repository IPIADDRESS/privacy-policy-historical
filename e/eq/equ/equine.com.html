<b>Information Collection and Use</b>
<p>
Internet Horse Classifieds and its owner Arcomix Design are the 
sole owners of the information collected on this site.  We will not 
sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different 
from what is disclosed in this statement.  Internet Horse Classifieds 
collects information from our users at several different points on 
our website.
</p><p>
<b>Registration</b>
</p><p>
In order to use some of the services of this website, a user must first 
complete the Owner Information form.  During registration a user is 
required to give their contact information (such as name and email address).  
This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site 
for which they have expressed interest.  Please note that the owner's email 
address and contact phone number will be displayed to our users. 
</p><p>
<b>Order</b>
</p><p>
We request information from the user on our order form.  Here a user must 
provide contact information (like name and billing address) and financial 
information (like credit card number, expiration date).  This information 
is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders.  If we have 
trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in 
touch with the user.
</p><p>
<b>Cookies</b>
</p><p>
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers).  
However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
</p><p>
<b>Log Files</b>
</p><p>
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's 
movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  
IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
</p><p>
<b>Sharing</b>
</p><p>
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and 
advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify 
any individual person.
</p><p>
We use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. 
These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable 
information for any secondary purposes.
</p><p>
We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs 
up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that 
is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are 
not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose 
of providing these services.
</p><p>
<b>Links</b>
</p><p>
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we INTERNET 
HORSE CLASSIFIEDS are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other 
sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to 
read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally 
identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information 
collected by this Web site.
</p><p>
<b>Security</b>
</p><p>
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When 
users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected 
both online and off-line.
</p><p>
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information 
(such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected 
with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure 
page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such 
as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as 
opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 
</p><p>
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also 
do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our 
users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is 
restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform 
a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) 
are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Our employees must 
use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.  When they return, 
they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information.  
Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy 
practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our 
employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, 
and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected.  
Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept 
in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.
</p><p>
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email 
to <a href="mailto:security@horseclassifieds.com">security@horseclassifieds.com</a>.
</p><p>
<b>Special Offers</b>
</p><p>
We may send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. 
Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, 
special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we 
present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our 
choice and opt-out below.
</p><p>
<b>Site and Service Updates</b>
</p><p>
We also may send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not 
able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information 
about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and 
in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.
</p><p>
<b>Correction/Updating Personal Information</b>
</p><p>
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your phone number 
or zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to 
provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.  
This can usually be done at the member information page or by emailing our Customer 
Support.  User's can update their information by going to 
http://www.horseclassifieds.com or by emailing listings@horseclassifieds.com.
</p><p>
<b>Choice/Opt-out</b>
</p><p>
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used 
for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the 
information.  
</p><p>
Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by 
any outside parties.  We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to 
whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.
</p><p>
<b>Notification of Changes</b>
</p><p>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our 
Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we 
use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide 
to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated 
at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will 
have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. 
We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the 
information was collected.
