	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<div id="main">
<h2>EQUIFAX ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY &amp; FAIR INFORMATION PRINCIPLES (U.K. Only)</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>For more than 100 years, Equifax (and its affiliated   companies) has been a catalyst for commerce by bringing businesses and consumers   together. We have built our reputation through a commitment to protecting the   privacy and confidentiality of sensitive information. This statement sets out   our Privacy Policy and explains what personal information we collect from users   of our website and what we do with that information. If you have any queries   about this policy or our information practices, please contact us using the   details given at the end of the policy. Please note that this policy only   applies to this website and not to any other websites including any that are   linked to it.</p>
<h2>Consent</h2>
<p>By using this website you signify that you have   consented to our collecting and using the personal information that you provide   to us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You will also be deemed to have   read and accepted this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy from   time to time and, if we do so, your continued use of the website will be taken   as acceptance of any such change. Therefore, we advise you to check this policy   on a regular basis.</p>
<h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
<p>This Policy applies to all information we receive from   you, whether you are registering on our website or ordering any of our products.   During the course of your use of this website, Equifax will collect two types of   information:</p>
<p>(i) Aggregated Information - This website automatically   gathers certain statistical information such as the number and frequency of   visitors. This information is only used in the aggregate and individuals cannot   be identified from it. This aggregated information helps us to measure how   individuals use the website and our services so that we can continually improve   them. We may share this aggregated data with other companies within the Equifax   Group.</p>
<p>(ii) Personal Information - Equifax requires personal   information from you, such as name and e-mail address, in order for us to   perform the services offered by the site and to fulfil your requests. Some of   this information is voluntary and the compulsory fields are clearly marked on   the form. On occasion, Equifax may also collect additional personal information   from you on a voluntary basis. This personal information may be used in a number   of ways:</p>
<p></p><ul>
  <li>Identifying potential customers or subscribers. </li>
  <li>As part of the account opening process for new customers, including   verifying your identity and carrying out a credit check on you. </li>
  <li>Providing you with the services that you have requested. </li>
  <li>We may from time to time send promotional e-mails to you with information   about our products and services. If you do not wish to receive such information   please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:marketingoptout@equifax.com">marketingoptout@equifax.com</a>. We   may contact you via post, e-mail or telephone in relation to the administration   of your account or the provision of your service. </li>
  <li>We may access and disclose personal information about you if you breach this   Privacy Policy, and/or to comply with applicable laws, court orders and lawful   government requests, to operate its systems properly or to protect itself and/or   its users. </li>
  <li>We reserve the right to sell the database related to this website (including   personal data relating to you) to a third party if we sell, assign or transfer   the assets of our business. </li>
  <li>We take all reasonable precautions to ensure that outside parties or   affiliated companies are aware of our Privacy Policy and that they will treat   the personally identifiable information in a similar manner. </li>
</ul>
