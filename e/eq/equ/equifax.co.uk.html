      </p>
      <p><strong>By using this website you agree that we can place the cookies described  below on your device</strong>. Please refer to the ‘How to manage cookies’ section of this policy for  more information.<br>

      </p>
      <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>What is a cookie?</strong><br>
        Cookies are text  files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your  device when you visit a website. A device can refer to a computer, smartphone  or tablet. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each  subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies  are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device. You can  find more information about cookies at: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a> . For a video about cookies visit <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/goodtoknow/data-on-the-web/cookies">www.google.co.uk/goodtoknow/data-on-the-web/cookies</a> <br>
        Cookies do lots of  different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently,  remembering your preferences, and generally improve your experience as a user. They  can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and  your interests.<br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>How we use cookies</strong><br>
        The cookies used on  this website have been categorised based on the categories found in the ICC UK  Cookie guide. A list of all the cookies used on this website, by category, is  set out below.<br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Category 1: Strictly necessary cookies - These cookies enable services you have  specifically asked for.</strong><br>
        These cookies are  essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its  features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies  services you have asked for, like shopping baskets, cannot be provided.<br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Category 2: Performance cookies - These cookies collect anonymous information  on the pages visited.</strong><br>
        These cookies  collect information about how visitors use the website, for instance which  pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages.  These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All  information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is  only used to improve how a website works.<br>
        An example of a  performance cookie we use is: </p>
      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="standard_tab">
        <tbody><tr>
          <td valign="top"><br>
            Google Analytics<strong> </strong></td>
          <td valign="top"><p>We use Google    Analytics to give us insight into how our users interact with the    website.&nbsp; The information collected is    anonymous and statistical in nature, including the number of visitors to the    website, where they have come to the site from and the pages they have    visited.<br>
            More information can be found at: <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html">http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html</a><strong> </strong></p></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody></table>
      <p><strong>Category 3: Functionality cookies - These cookies remember choices you make to improve your experience.</strong><br>
        These cookies allow the website to  remember choices you make (such as your user name or the region you are in) and  provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to  remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages  that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have  asked for such as watching a video. The information these cookies collect is  anonymised and cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.<br>
        An example of a functional cookie we use is:</p>
      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="standard_tab">
        <tbody><tr>
          <td valign="top"><br>
            Style<strong> </strong></td>
          <td valign="top"><p>A content    management session cookie used to remember selections and preferences which    expires when the user exists their browser session.&nbsp; The cookie stores no personal data or    identifiers.<strong> </strong></p></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody></table>
      <p><strong>Category 4: Targeting cookies or advertising cookies - These cookies collect information about your  browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your  interests.</strong> <br>
        These are usually third party cookies  (see section below) used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your  interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an  advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign.  They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s  permission. They remember that you have visited the website and this information  is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting  or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the  other organisation.<br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>How to manage cookies</strong><br>
        Most web browsers automatically  accept cookies.&nbsp; However you do not have  to accept cookies and you can, should you choose at any time, reject or block  the use of cookies and delete all cookies currently stored on your device.<br>
        You can find out how to do this for  your particular browser by clicking ‘help’ on your browser’s menu, or by  visiting: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> . For example, in  Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0 you can delete cookies by selecting  ‘Tools/Internet Options’, clicking on ‘Delete’ in the Browsing History section  and then selecting ‘delete cookies’.&nbsp;  Options to accept, block or require notification for the use of cookies  are found under: ‘Tools/Internet Options/Privacy/Advanced’.&nbsp; <br>
        Please be aware however that if you chose to block  cookies you may not be able to access certain features of the website.<br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Third party cookies</strong><br>
        We may allow third party organisations to set  cookies using our website in order to deliver services.&nbsp; If you would like more information about the  cookies used by these third parties, please see their individual privacy  policies listed below:</p>
