              General</h5>
            <p>For more than 100 years, Equifax (and its affiliated companies)
              has been a catalyst for commerce by bringing businesses and consumers
              together. We have built our reputation through a commitment to
              protecting the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive information.
              This statement sets out our Privacy Policy and explains what personal
              information we collect from users of our website and what we do
              with that information. If you have any queries about this policy
              or our information practices, please contact us using the details
              given at the end of the policy. Please note that this policy only
              applies to this website and not to any other websites including
              any that are linked to it.</p>
