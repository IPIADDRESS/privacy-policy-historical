This statement sets out our Privacy and Cookie and explains what  personal information we collect from users of our website and what we do with  that information. If you have any queries about this policy or our information  practices, please contact us using the details given at the end of the policy.  Please note that this policy only applies to this website and not to any other  websites including any that are linked to it.</p>
   <h2>Consent</h2>
   <p><strong>By using this website you agree that we can place the cookies described  below on your device</strong>. Please refer to the ‘How to manage cookies’ section  of this policy for more information.</p>
   <p>By using this website you also signify that you have consented to our  collecting and using the personal information that you provide to us in  accordance with this Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy. You will also be deemed to  have read and accepted this Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy.</p>
   <h2>Cookies</h2>
   <p><strong>What is a cookie?</strong></p>
   <p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are  downloaded to your device when you visit a website. A device can refer to a  computer, smartphone or tablet. Cookies are then sent back to the originating  website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie.  Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device.  You can find more information about cookies at: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a> . For a  video about cookies visit <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/goodtoknow/data-on-the-web/cookies">www.google.co.uk/goodtoknow/data-on-the-web/cookies</a></p>
  <p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages  efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improve the user  experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more  relevant to you and your interests.</p>
   <p><strong>How we  use cookies</strong></p>
   <p>The cookies used on this website have been categorised based on the categories  found in the ICC UK Cookie guide. A list of all the cookies used on this  website, by category, is set out below.</p>
   <p><strong>Category 1: Strictly necessary cookies - These cookies  enable services you have specifically asked for.</strong></p><p>
   These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website  and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without  these cookies services you have asked for, like shopping baskets, cannot be  provided.</p>
   <p><strong>Category 2: Performance cookies - These cookies collect  anonymous information on the pages visited.</strong></p>
   <p>These cookies collect information about how visitors use the website, for  instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages  from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a  visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore  anonymous. It is only used to improve how a website works.</p>
   <p>An example of a performance cookie we use is: </p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td valign="top">
      <strong>Google Analytics</strong></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>We use Google Analytics to give us insight into how our    users interact with the website.&nbsp; The information collected is anonymous    and statistical in nature, including the number of visitors to the website,    where they have come to the site from and the pages they have visited.<br>
      More information can be found at: <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html">http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html</a><strong> </strong></p></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Category 3: Functionality  cookies - These cookies remember choices you make to improve your experience.</strong></p>
<p>These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user  name or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features.  These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size,  fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be  used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video. The  information these cookies collect is anonymised and cannot track your browsing  activity on other websites.</p>
<p>An example of a functional cookie we use is:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td valign="top">
      <strong>Style </strong></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>A content management session cookie used to remember    selections and preferences which expires when the user exists their browser    session.&nbsp; The cookie stores no personal data or identifiers.<strong> </strong></p></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Category 4: Targeting cookies  or advertising cookies - These cookies collect information about your browsing  habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your interests.</strong></p>
<p>These are usually third party cookies (see section below) used to deliver  adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit  the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the  effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by  advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that  you have visited the website and this information is shared with other  organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies  will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.</p>
  
<p><strong>How to  manage cookies</strong></p>
<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies.&nbsp; However you do not have  to accept cookies and you can, should you choose at any time, reject or block  the use of cookies and delete all cookies currently stored on your device.<br>
  You can find out how to do this for your particular browser by clicking ‘help’  on your browser’s menu, or by visiting: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> .
