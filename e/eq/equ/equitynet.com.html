                <br><br>

                            <b>Personal information</b> – When you sign up for an EquityNet account, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, address, phone number, email address, and account username and password).

When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is EquityNet’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns.

                <br><br>
                Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time.
