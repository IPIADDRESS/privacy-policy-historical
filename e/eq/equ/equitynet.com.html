                <b>Information we collect and how we use it</b>    
                <br><br>
                We offer a service that requires you to register for an account and provide some personal and enterprise information to us.  In order to provide our services, we may collect the following types of information:
                <br><br>
                <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
                    <tbody><tr>
                        <td valign="top" width="20">•	</td>
                        <td>
                            <b>Information you provide</b> – When you sign up for an EquityNet account, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, address, phone number, email address, and account username and password).  We also request that our customers provide credit card or other payment account information, which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers.  This information is collected for internal use only and will not be sold to or shared with third-party firms.
                            <br><br>

                        <td valign="top" width="20">•	</td>
                        <td>
                            <b>Information security</b> – We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data.  These security measures include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices, and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.  We restrict access to personal information to EquityNet employees and third party service providers who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services.  These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

Transparency of user and enterprise data related to an identifiable enterprise is restricted to recipient users who have been specifically authorized to view such information by the originating and authorizing user.
