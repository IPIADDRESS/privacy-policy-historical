<h2><a id="notice" name="notice"></a>NOTICE - We provide information to you about:</h2>
<p><a id="about_you" name="about_you"></a><strong>The Information We Collect About You</strong><br>
This Equifax online privacy policy applies to all information we receive online from you and about you in connection with an online transaction or request. The information, if any, which we collect from or about you while you are accessing and using our web sites covered by this privacy policy depends on what you do while you on our web sites. <strong>If you do not</strong>: 1) register or fill out any forms at an Equifax web site, 2) request disclosure of your individual credit file or individual credit score, 3) file an online dispute reinvestigation request, 4) request an initial fraud alert or an active duty alert be placed on your credit file online, 5) request a security freeze, a temporary lift, or a permanent removal of a security freeze on your credit file online, or 6) become a Member of Personal Solutions or request a Personal Solutions product, <strong>then we do not collect any <em>personally identifiable information or business organization identifiable information</em> about you while you are accessing or using our web sites</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>If you do:</strong> 1) register or fill out any forms at an Equifax web site, 2) request disclosure of your individual credit file or individual credit score, 3) file an online dispute reinvestigation request, 4) request an initial fraud alert or an active duty alert be placed on your credit file online, 5) request a security freeze, a temporary lift, or a permanent removal of a security freeze on your credit file online, or 6) become a Member of Personal Solutions or request a Personal Solutions product, <strong>then we do collect <em>personally identifiable information</em> or <em>business organization identifiable information</em> from you or about you online.</strong> However, in these situations we only collect certain information from you and about you to process your request and to verify your identity to be sure that we are assisting the proper individual or business organization.</p>
<p><a id="from_you" name="from_you"></a><strong>Information From You</strong><br>
Specifically, we receive information from you online when you: 1) register or fill out any forms at an Equifax web site, 2) request disclosure of your individual credit file or individual credit score, 3) file an online dispute reinvestigation request, 4) request an initial fraud alert or an active duty alert be placed on your credit file online, 5) request a security freeze, a temporary lift, or a permanent removal of a security freeze on your credit file online, or 6) become a Member of Personal Solutions or request a Personal Solutions product. Becoming a Member of Personal Solutions enables <em>you as an individual</em> to purchase Personal Solutions products, such as Equifax Credit Report™; Score Power®; Equifax Credit Watch™; or 3-in-1 Credit Report, and <em>you as a business organization</em> to purchase Personal Solutions products, such as Equifax Business Credit Report™, or Equifax Business Credit Report With Score™. Additionally, when <em>you as an individual</em> do any of these things we will verify your identity by asking you to provide certain information that only you should know and we may ask you from two to six multiple-choice questions about "non-wallet-type" information contained in your individual credit file. The answers to these questions used to verify your identity as an individual are not provided to any nonaffiliated third party. When <em>you as a business organization</em> become a Member of Personal Solutions we may ask for information to verify your business organization.</p>
<p>We also receive information from you online when you send us e-mail, applications and other forms, or register at our web sites.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>
<p><a id="from_others" name="from_others"></a><strong>Information From Others</strong><br>
We may also collect information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others, such as the products and services you ordered. In connection with requests for Personal Solutions products, for example, we access your Equifax individual credit file information or your Equifax business organization credit file. In connection with verifying your identity as an individual we may also collect from outside sources <em>personally identifiable information</em> about you, such as name, address, driver's license information, and e-mail addresses. When you request your free annual Equifax individual credit report through <a href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com/">www.annualcreditreport.com</a>, the information you provide at that web site is provided to us to process your request. Also, in connection with verifying the identity of <em>you as a business organization</em> we may collect from outside sources <em>business organization identifiable information</em>, such as name, address, and e-mail address.</p>
<p><a id="collect" name="collect"></a><strong>How We Use The Information We Collect</strong><br>
We use the information we collect about you to handle the requests you make to us. If <em>you as an individual</em> request an individual credit file disclosure or an individual credit score disclosure, either directly from us or through <a href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com/">www.annualcreditreport.com</a>, or initiate an online dispute reinvestigation,&nbsp;or request an initial fraud alert or an active duty alert be placed on your credit file online, or request a security freeze, a temporary lift, or a permanent removal of a security freeze on your credit file online, the information we collect from you is only used to handle those requests and possibly update your Equifax individual credit file.</p>
<p>In connection with your online request that an initial fraud alert or an active duty alert be placed on your credit file, we will use your email address to communicate with you regarding the status of your online request for an initial fraud alert or an active duty alert. </p>
<p>When you become a Member of Personal Solutions we also use the information we collect about you. Once you have become Member of Personal Solutions, we use the information when you ask Personal Solutions to provide you: 1) the Personal Solutions products and services you requested; 2) support for these Personal Solutions products and services; and 3) information about your Personal Solutions products.</p>
<p>Additionally, as legally permitted, we may use the information we collect for your Personal Solutions Membership and other requests, including postal address and/or e-mail address, to send you promotions for Personal Solutions products and services. (Of course, you may opt out of receiving such promotions. See the "CHOICE" section of this privacy policy.)</p>
<p>Information collected when you register at Equifax web sites other than the web sites to which this privacy policy applies (they are identified at the beginning of this privacy policy) is used for the purposes identified on those web site registration forms.</p>
<p><a id="disclose" name="disclose"></a><strong>To Whom We May Disclose The Information We Collect</strong><br>
We may disclose any information collected from you or about you through the web sites to which this Privacy Policy applies as required by law or legal process.</p>
<p>We take reasonable precautions to be sure that nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates, to whom we disclose <em>personally identifiable information</em> or <em>business organization identifiable information</em>, as described below, are aware of our privacy policy and fair information principles and will treat the information in a similarly responsible manner. Our contracts and written agreement with nonaffiliated third parties that receive information from us about <em>you as an individual</em>, who has not opted out of this disclosure, prevent further transfer of the information.</p>
<p>When <em>personally identifiable information</em> or <em>business identifiable information</em> is collected when you register at an Equifax web site other than those covered by this privacy policy, the information will be disclosed, if at all, pursuant to the privacy policy for that web site.</p>
<p>Equifax is not, however, responsible for the privacy practices or content of link sites listed on our web pages. The owners of these pages are responsible for them.</p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<p><strong>A. If you do not become a Member of Personal Solutions</strong></p>
<p>When <em>you as an individual</em> request disclosure of your individual Equifax credit file or disclosure of your individual Equifax credit score without becoming a Member of Personal Solutions or when <em>you as an individual</em> initiate an online dispute reinvestigation request, or request an initial fraud alert or an active duty alert be placed on your credit file online, or request a security freeze, a temporary lift, or a permanent removal of a security freeze on your credit file online,&nbsp;we may disclose any of the information we collect from or about you, as described above, to affiliated companies, as well as non-affiliated third parties (companies that are not owned or controlled by us), such as a consumer credit reporting agency on the Equifax credit reporting system that owns the credit file, and the sources of disputed information, including credit grantors and public record vendors. The information provided to affiliates and non-affiliated third parties is disclosed only as required to process and fulfill these requests for you.</p>
<p><strong>B. If you become a Member of Personal Solutions</strong></p>
<p>When you become a Member of Personal Solutions and purchase products or services directly from Personal Solutions, we may disclose any of the information we collect from or about you, as described above, to the following types of non-affiliated third parties (companies that are not owned or controlled by us) for various business purposes, including marketing and joint business efforts for related and unrelated products and services, <em>such as:</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>Financial services providers, such as banks and mortgage lenders; </li>
    <li>Non-financial companies such as retailers, direct marketers, and publishers; </li>
    <li>Companies that perform marketing services on our behalf and other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements; and </li>
    <li>Others, as permitted by law. </li>
</ul>
<p>We may also disclose any of the information we collect, as described above, to affiliates, which are companies that are related to us by common ownership or affiliated with us by common control.</p>
<p>We may disclose any of the information, as described above, to the types of affiliates and non-affiliated third parties, described above, whether <em>you as an individual</em> or <em>you as a business organization</em> make a one-time purchase of a Personal Solutions product or <em>you as an individual</em> or <em>you as a business organization</em> have an ongoing or prior Member relationship with Personal Solutions.</p>

A cookie is a piece of text information that a web server may transfer to the hard drive of your computer through your web browser when you visit a web site. Cookies are commonly used on web sites to improve your experience and to enable systems to recognize your browser. Some cookies last only through a single visit (session cookie); other may have an expiration date; still others may remain on your computer until you delete them (persistent cookie). Only the information that you provide, or the choices you make while visiting a web site can be stored in a cookie. For example, the web site cannot determine your e-mail address unless you choose to type it.</p>
<p><a id="howCookies" name="howCookies"></a><strong>How We Use Cookies:</strong><br>

We may combine cookie data with <em>personally identifiable information</em> or <em>business organization identifiable information</em> you provide to us (e.g., your e-mail address) so that you may receive marketing offers likely to be of interest to you. Of course, you may opt out of receiving these offers at any time by following the instructions in the marketing offer. We may sometimes use outside technology companies to set cookies on our web site and collect cookie information for us.

<p><a id="acceptCookies" name="acceptCookies"></a><strong>How You Can Accept or Reject Cookies:</strong><br>
You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by establishing your preferences in your web browser. Please understand that, if you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to use certain of our online services or web site features. Internet Explorer is set up to allow the creation of cookies; however, you can specify that you be prompted before a web site puts a cookie on your hard disk, so you can choose to allow or disallow the cookie; or you can prevent Internet Explorer from accepting any cookies. You can specify different settings for different security zones. For example, you might want to allow web sites to create cookies if they are in your Trusted sites or Local intranet zone, prompt you before creating cookies if they are in your Internet zone and never allow cookies if they are in your Restricted sites zone.</p>
