<p>We collect no personal information about you when you visit
www.eeoc.gov unless you choose to provide this information to us.
Our web server, which is run by the Government Printing Office
(<acronym title="Government Printing Office">GPO</acronym>), does collect certain information automatically, and some of
this information is made available to us.</p>

<h2>If you visit our site to read or download information, the
following information is collected automatically by the web
server:</h2>

<ul>
<li>The name of the domain (for example, aol.com, if you use an
America OnLine Account, or princeton.edu if you connect from
Princeton University's domain), and the IP address (an IP address
is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer
whenever you are surfing the web) from which you access the
Internet;</li>

<li>The date and time that you access our site; and</li>

<li>The pages you visit.</li>
</ul>

<p><acronym title="Government Printing Office">GPO</acronym> uses special software to analyze the information collected
in the web server's logs, and generates a report for us that we use
to determine the number of visitors to the different sections of
our site, and to help us make our site more useful to visitors like

their visits.</p>

<h2>If you send us personal information</h2>

<p>If you choose to provide us with personal information, as in
e-mail with a comment or question, or by filling out a form with
your personal information and submitting it to us through our web
site, we use that information to respond to your message and to
help us get you the information you have requested. We do not share our e-mail with any other organizations, unless we receive a request from an organization conducting a civil or criminal law enforcement investigation.</p>

<h2>Links to other sites</h2>

<p>Our web site has links to other federal agencies. In a few cases
we may link to private organizations. When you link to another
site, you are no longer on our site and are subject to the privacy
policy of the new site.</p>

<h2>Use of cookies</h2>

<p>Our web site is designed to <a href="style/about.html">allow visitors to change the appearance of the site</a> by selecting from several style sheets. The main purpose of this is to improve accessibility and make the site easier to use for people with limited vision, or people who use adaptive equipment to access the web.
