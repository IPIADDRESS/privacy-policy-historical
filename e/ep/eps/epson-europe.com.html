                    can be asked for personal information such as your name, address, 
                    age and e-mail address (collectively called: "Personal

                    You do not have to provide the Optional Information. However, 
                    if you do not do so, this may limit our ability to provide 
                    you with a specific service or offer you personalised content. 
                    You are required to correctly register Personal Information 
                    as of the date of registration. If your Personal Information 
                    changes after the registration, you are requested to immediately 
                    change/up-date your Personal Information. Neglecting to do

                    for the Epson site you are visiting.</p>

                  <p>Epson will not disclose any of your data (personal information 
                    or optional personal information) to a third party without 
                    your consent, unless we believe, in good faith, that the law 
                    requires it or that the rights or property of Epson need to 
                    be protected. </p>
                  <p>12. What choices are available regarding collection, use

                    partners), at the time we ask you for this information. In 
                    addition, whenever we contact you via email or mail, we will 
                    also provide instructions on how to unsubscribe so that you 
                    will not receive any future emails or mail from us if you 
                    choose. </p>
                  <p>13. As previously mentioned, you may choose to not provide 
                    us with any of the information we request, though this may 
                    limit our ability to provide you with a specific service or 
                    limit our ability to offer personalised content. For example,

                    (such as your email address), demographic information (such

                  <p>4. How to Use Your Personal Information</p>
                  <p>If you choose to register with Epson on an Epson site you 
                    can be asked for personal information such as your name, address, 
                    age and e-mail address (collectively called: "Personal 
                    Information"). You may also provide other personal information,

                    "Optional Information") at your sole discretion. 
                    You do not have to provide the Optional Information. However, 
                    if you do not do so, this may limit our ability to provide 
                    you with a specific service or offer you personalised content. 
                    You are required to correctly register Personal Information 
                    as of the date of registration. If your Personal Information 
                    changes after the registration, you are requested to immediately 
                    change/up-date your Personal Information. Neglecting to do 
                    so may result in failure to receive any service, notice or 
                    information from Epson. Please refer to the registration instructions 
                    for the Epson site you are visiting.</p>
                  <p>5. Epson may use your Personal Information and Optional Information 
                    (collectively "User Information") for the purpose 
                    of administering and/or improving this Site and as described 
                    in this Policy.</p>
                  <p>6. Please note that you may access and partially use Epson 
                    sites without providing your Personal Information and/or Optional

                  <p>7. What does Epson do with the data it collects?</p>

                    Optional Information), it is intended to provide service -tailored

                    your experience on the site. We may use information you have 
                    given us to target offerings by email or mail that may be 
                    of interest to you. In every such email or mail, we will also 
                    have instructions on how to unsubscribe and avoid receiving 
                    any future emails from us. </p>
                  <p>9. On occasion, we will send email or mail communications 
                    to provide you with information, which we think you will find 
                    useful, including information about new products and services

                    our policy to send email or mail only to customers who give

                    any future emails from us. </p>

                    of the personal information relating to you that we hold and

                  <p>Epson will not disclose any of your data (personal information 
                    or optional personal information) to a third party without 
                    your consent, unless we believe, in good faith, that the law 
                    requires it or that the rights or property of Epson need to 
                    be protected. </p>

                    addition, whenever we contact you via email or mail, we will 
                    also provide instructions on how to unsubscribe so that you 
                    will not receive any future emails or mail from us if you

                    us with any of the information we request, though this may 
                    limit our ability to provide you with a specific service or
