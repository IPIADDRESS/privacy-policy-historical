      <p><b>When You Are Just Visiting Us...</b><br>
        You can always visit our site without revealing who you are or providing 
        any Personal Information. When you visit our site or visit our site through 
        one of our partner's sites, we do collect usage information ("session 
        data"), but it is anonymous and is not linked to you as an individual. 
        We use session data to better understand things like how our site is navigated, 
        how many visitors arrive at specific pages, the length and frequency of 
        stays at our site, the variety of searches of our site's database, the 
        types of browsers and computer operating systems used by our visitors 
        and the Internet Protocol addresses from which our visitors connect to 
        our site. We use this information to improve our site content and ease 
        of use.</p>
      <p><b>Cookies.</b><br>
        We may place a "cookie" on your personal computer. A Cookie 
        is a small computer file that our computer sends to your computer and 
        that your computer sends back to us each time you make a request from 
        our site. Cookies help us recognize you when you visit our site again. 
        We use cookies on our site to collect session data for several purposes 
        to personalize and improve your individual viewing experiences on our 
        site. For example, we use cookies to keep track of your use of our site, 
        gather data to improve the content of our site, provide information that 
        may be of interest to you and improve the security of your experience 
        with us. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. However, 
        you can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting 
        cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit. 
        If you decide not to accept our cookies, you will still be able to access 
        those parts of our site that are available to the general public, but 
        you will not be able to view some information on our site, use some features 
        designed to enhance your experience at our site or access many of the 
        services offered at our site.</p>
      <p><b>When You Decide To Enroll With Us...</b></p>
      <p><br>
        <b>Personal Information.<br>
        </b>If you decide to enroll with us, we will collect Personal Information 
        about you that you voluntarily share with us. We collect Personal Information 
        that is necessary for us to provide you with the services offered on our 
        site. As mentioned, this Personal Information includes things like your 
        name, e-mail and mailing address, social security number, business, trade 
        references and telephone numbers ("Personal Information").</p>
      <p><b>Other Information.</b><br>
        You may decide to share other information ("Other Information") 
        with us about yourself (for example, demographic information like your 
        age and gender). This other information ("Other Information") 
        will be treated the same as described in Personal Information ("Personal 
        Information").</p>
      <p><b>Sharing of Personal Information.</b><br>
        Generally, we only disclose your Personal Information to those Electronic 
        Payment System employees and/or providers that require the Personal Information 
        to make a decision regarding your enrollment. For example, when you make 
        application for services it would be necessary to Share that information 
        with the Bank, a leasing company if you desire to lease a terminal or 
        equipment and/or other providers of services you have requested. There 
        are services that compliment the ones you are applying for and may benefit 
        you and your business. We will share contact information with these complimentary 
        type service providers. We use our reasonable efforts to ensure that these 
        providers will also protect your Personal Information. We contract with 
        other companies to perform various functions necessary to operate our 
        business - for example, to ship items and process transactions. We will 
        share with these other companies only that Personal Information they require 
        to fulfill your orders. These companies agree that they will not use or 
        disclose that Personal Information for any other purpose. Other than as 
        explained in this policy, we will not disclose any Personal Information 
        we collect from you to others without your permission, except in certain 
        limited circumstances: (a) to protect the security of our site and our 
        rights under our <a href="terms.htm" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions 
        of Use</a>; (b) to protect ourselves against liability; (c) in response 
        to legal process, (d) if we believe in good faith that the law requires 
        it; or (e) in connection with a sale of our business or company. Please 
        note that if we receive a formal request to disclose your Personal Information 
        in connection with a legal action, we will attempt to tell you about it 
        at least ten (10) days before we respond to that request, if permitted 
        by law, via the contact information you provided during enrollment.</p>
      <p><b>Combined Non-Personal Information.</b><br>
        We may also combine anonymous information supplied by you and other users 
        during enrollment on our site with information about your use and others' 
        use of our site. We will use this combined information to describe our 
        user base, without reference to any specific individual, to potential 
        partners, investors and advertisers. We will not share your Personal Information 
        with any other users of our site, but we may use information we collect 
        about your use to make recommendations to other users of our site. We 
        may also share aggregated statistical information about users of our site 
        and our service and product offerings with others, including our vendors 
        and partners. We will not link this statistical information to any Personal 
        Information that can identify you as an individual.</p>
      <p><b>Additional Products and Services.</b><br>
        We may partner with other companies to offer you additional products or 
        services. If you sign up for any of these additional products or services, 
        we will share your name and any other Personal Information that is necessary 
        for these other companies to provide the products or services you have 
        signed up for. This policy will not cover the use of your Personal Information 
        by these other companies. We encourage you to read each other company's 
        privacy policy before signing up for any of its products or services. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Notification of Changes.</b><br>
        We may change this policy from time to time. If we decide to change this 
        policy in a material way (for example, a change regarding disclosure of 
        Personal Information), we will post notice of the change on our site at 
        least thirty (30) days before putting the change into effect. If we decide 
        to change our policy in a less significant way, we will simply post notice 
        of the change on our site at least ten (10) days before putting the change 
        into effect. </p>
      <p><b>How We Protect Your Information.</b><br>
        We are committed to safeguarding your information. For that reason we 
        employ a staff of security technology professionals and utilize a full 
        range of the best security technology available. Specifically, your information 
        is secured from unauthorized access from the Internet through market leading 
        firewall technology. We also protect the connection between your computer 
        and our server from eavesdropping through industry-standard encryption 
        technology known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Depending on your browser, 
        this SSL will have encryption keys of up to 128 bits. To ensure that we 
        fulfill our commitment to safeguard your information, we continually assess 
        new technology for protecting your information to make sure that our information 
        handling practices are in accordance with the highest industry standards 
        and best practices on the Internet at all times.</p>
      <p><b>Links.</b><br>
        Our site provides links to other sites. When you click on one of these 
        links, you are leaving our site and entering another site that we do not 
        control and for which we cannot be responsible. You should carefully review 
        the privacy statements or policies on any other site that you visit because 
        those privacy statements or policies will apply to your visit to that 
        site and may be very different from our policy.</p>
      <p><b>Contact Us.</b><br>
        If you have any questions or concerns about this policy or our information 
        handling practices, you may contact our Chief Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@eps-na.com?subject=EPS Privacy Questions&amp;body=undefined">privacy@eps-na.com</a>. 
        We will attempt to respond to your questions or concerns within five (5) 
        business days after we receive them.</p>
      <p><b>A Special Note about Children...</b></p>
      <p><b>Children.<br>
        </b>Children - in fact minors (individuals under 18 years of age) - are 
        not eligible to enroll for or use the services available on our site. 
        We believe that parents should play a central role in their child's online 
        activities and should monitor those activities to ensure that sites visited 
        by their child are respecting their child's privacy. For additional information 
        on protecting children's privacy, visit the Federal Trade Commission's 
        "Kid'z Privacy" page at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html</a>.
