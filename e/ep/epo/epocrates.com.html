INTRODUCTION<br>
ePocrates has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy and the privacy of your patients. This statement sets forth our policies and practices regarding the <a href="http://www.epocrates.com">http://www.epocrates.com</a> web site (“Site”), the ePocrates software products (“Software”) and other ePocrates programs, activities and services such as ePocrates Honors™ (“Services”).  It is possible, however, that from time to time users participating in particular programs or who use particular products may be subject to different policies, in which case you will be appraised of the applicable policies when you elect to participate in those programs or use those products. 


</p><p>
IMPORTANT TERMS<br>
In this policy, when we use the term "we," we mean both ePocrates and third parties with whom ePocrates contracts to assist in its business operations.  These contractors may, however, only access your information in furtherance of their services to ePocrates and may not use or disclose your information except as permitted by ePocrates.
</p><p>
When reviewing any privacy policy on the Internet, you should be familiar with the terms "personally identifiable" and "non-personally identifiable" information.  "Personally identifiable information" is any information that can be used to identify, contact or locate you as an individual, as well as any additional data tied to such information.  Common examples are your name and email address, along with purchase information associated with those fields.  Non-personally identifiable information is information-either in "profile" or "aggregate" form-that, in contrast, is not intended to identify you as an individual.  For instance, we may store a profile of an oncologist in New York without tying this information to a name, address or other personally identifiable information.  We may also aggregate information to produce general data, such as figures that show that half of our users are over thirty-five years old.
</p><p>
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?<br>
</p><p>
CONTACT AND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION<br>
If you wish to register to use our Software, receive our Services or make a purchase on our Site, you are asked provide a variety of information, including (a) contact information such as your name and email address, and (b) demographic information such as your date of birth, profession, specialty and medical school attended.  We may also collect similar information through contests or other promotions, or through your emailed information and technical support inquiries.  Finally, we may supplement your data with information from third parties, including the AMA.
</p><p>
SITE TECHNICAL AND USAGE INFORMATION<br>
As with most Internet sites, the Site collects a variety of technical data, including your IP address (a unique number that identifies your access account on the Internet), domain, and Web browser information.  We may track the pages you visited before coming to the Site, the pages to which you jump when you leave the Site, which of our pages you access, and how long you spend on each page.
</p><p>
The Site uses "cookies," which are small pieces of information stored on your computer and accessed by our Site.  Cookies let our Site recognize returning visitors to our Site, record a visitor's progress from page to page, and recall certain information a visitor entered previously.  For instance, a cookie may store your password, or note your particular areas of interest.  You can choose to decline our cookies (e.g., by setting your browser to reject cookies), but if you do, some parts of the Site may not operate properly. 
</p><p>
SOFTWARE USAGE DATA<br>
ePocrates collects information about your Software usage, and stores this information in both personally identifiable and aggregate forms.  This data may include, for instance, which Software screens you visit most often and the number of times you have looked up a certain drug.
</p><p>
HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?<br>
As stated above, your satisfaction with our services is essential to our success, and so we are careful how we use the information we collect.  We use contact and demographic information to alert you to developments in the use of pharmaceuticals, from new drugs approved to new studies on existing drugs.  We also use this information to contact you regarding relevant ePocrates services and products.  For instance, we may contact you (e.g., by email or through PDA-based or desktop messaging products) to you to let you know that we have released a new version of Software or Services, that there are new drug interactions of which you should be aware or that we are modifying one of our policies.  We may also use contact and demographic information to send you materials from some of our partners. Please be assured, however, that we do NOT share or sell your name, e-mail address or other contact information with anyone for these purposes.  Additionally, we may share aggregated demographic data about our users, such as the number of ePocrates users in California, with a variety of third parties such as current and potential investors and business partners.
</p><p>
We use technical and usage information in personally identifiable form to tailor your experience at our Site, on our Software or in connection with Services.  This may involve displaying content according to your preferences, or showing you new information that we believe will interest you.  We also use technical and usage information to help improve the design and function of our Software, Services and Site, and may contact you with questions about your use of these.  For example, our development effort has typically considered drug reference usage information and user feedback to establish priorities.
</p><p>
Though we may use aggregate demographic and usage information in business relationships with third parties, we strictly limit the personally identifiable information we share and how it may be used.  Specifically, we provide personally identifiable information only to those third parties that in turn use this data to produce and distribute aggregate or non-personally identifiable information. For instance, we may forward drug look-up and other Software usage data to companies that merge this information with their own records and produce aggregate results about the processes doctors follow when prescribing certain drugs.  However, be assured that NO drug company will have access to information from us about your particular drug lookups or other personally identifiable information. If you do not wish us to collect any personal data, we recommend that you discontinue using ePocrates software.
</p><p>
Finally, notwithstanding anything else in this policy:  (i) in the unlikely event that ePocrates (or substantially all of its assets) are acquired, personally identifiable and aggregate information may be transferred as part of such assets; and (ii) we may share any information with third parties if we are compelled to do so by force of law.
</p><p>
Note regarding patient data:  To the extent we begin collecting patient data, we will treat this data in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and other applicable laws and regulations. 
</p><p>
LINKS TO OTHER SITES<br>
The Site may contain links to or from other sites.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such sites. 
</p><p>
SECURITY<br>
ePocrates is committed to ensuring the security of your information.  We safeguard the security of the data you send us with physical,
electronic and managerial procedures.  We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data while on the Internet.  Change
your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.
<br><br>
Our commerce site uses industry standard secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption.  To make purchases from our store you must use an SSL
enabled browser.  This protects the confidentiality of your information while it is transmitted over the Internet.  As part of real-time
payment processing, ePocrates subscribes to a fraud management service.  This service provides an extra level of protection to guard
against credit card fraud.
</p><p>
CHOICE/OPT-OUT<br>
You may opt out of receiving the following information by updating your profile on our website: E-mails of our newsletter and other updates or information about incentive programs or opportunities to assist ePocrates with product development that we may offer from time to time. To opt out of any of these services, please return to our website, and log in using your ePocrates username and password. Then, click “My Profile” and click “Edit”.  Go to the bottom of the form and opt out of your choice, if you select a box, you will NOT receive information. If you wish to opt out of ePocrates' software and services altogether, whereupon we will cease contacting you, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@epocrates.com">info@epocrates.com</a> and we will not contact you again.
</p><p>
CORRECT/UPDATE<br>
The Site gives visitors the option of correcting, updating and/or changing contact and demographic information previously provided and stored on our database.  Visitors wishing to correct, update or change their information on our database should go to the online registration form at <a href="http://www.epocrates.com">http://www.epocrates.com</a> and provide the appropriate information. 
</p><p>
CHANGE POLICY<br>
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by providing notice of the existence of a revised Privacy Policy via email or notice on the Site or Software.  Your continued use of the Site, Software or Services following the posting of changes to this privacy policy will indicate that you have accepted those changes.
</p><p>
