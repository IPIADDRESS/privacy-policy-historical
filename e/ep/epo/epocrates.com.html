<h4>Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information.</h4>
<p>At Epocrates, we are committed to respecting your privacy. We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. We take this trust very seriously, and that's why we have put a policy in place to protect your personal information and to document our commitment to you that we will not sell or share your personally identifiable information, including your name, email address, or the information you look up in our medical references, without your permission or as required by law.</p>
<p>The Epocrates Privacy Policy set out below describes our policies and practices regarding the information we collect from you, how we use that information and our commitment to you to safeguard that information. Specifically, this policy addresses the following topics:</p>

<h3><a name="what_info" id="what_info"></a>What information does Epocrates collect?</h3>
<p>At times, we may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information. Generally this information is requested when you register for a software subscription or online service or when you provide information in connection with an online transaction.</p>
<ul>
<li> When you order, we ask you for your name, e-mail address, shipping and billing addresses, telephone number, and credit card information so that we can complete the transaction.</li>
<li> When you register with Epocrates, we ask for demographic and contact information including your name, e-mail address, date of birth, profession, specialty and medical school attended so that we can provide you with more customized service and information.</li>
<li> When you use Epocrates products, we may track your use of the product, including responses to opportunities to receive further information about clinical messages that you found interesting, as well as what screens you personally review. We do this to provide you with a better experience. For more information on this practice, please refer to "Does Epocrates track your use of its products?" below.</li>
<li> There may be other instances when we ask for information from you. For example, when you participate in a survey or product test or when you enter a contest or other promotional event, we may ask for additional personal information. The information collected, its purpose and how it will be used and by whom will be explained to you at the point of collection if jointly offered with a partner organization or within the accompanying terms for other situations. </li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we may supplement your data with information from third parties, including the AMA. For example, we compare the name, medical school and graduation information you provide with the AMA database to help verify the accuracy of our subscriber database.</p>

<h3><a name="how_use" id="how_use"></a>How does Epocrates use the information we collect?</h3>
<p>One of Epocrates' strengths is its community of subscribers. At Epocrates, we strive to extend beyond our applications and provide other services that bring additional value to our subscribers. This includes services such as our Epocrates Honors™ and Advocate programs, and in particular DocAlert messages. These are brief, timely messages that sometimes may be sent to the entire subscriber base if warranted (such as safety alerts from the FDA), but more often are of interest to select groups of subscribers, for example, a particular sub-specialty. To do this, we need to understand who our subscribers are and collect information that will assist us in tailoring subscribers' experiences.</p>
<p>Your satisfaction with our services is essential to our success, and so we are careful how we use the information we collect. Epocrates uses your personal information to operate our web site and/or affect your transactions and to assist with the continual improvement of the content and function of Epocrates products. For this reason, we monitor customer traffic patterns and usage to help us improve the design, layout and usability of our products and to provide content and product features of interest to you.</p>
<p>We use contact and demographic information to alert you to developments in the use of pharmaceuticals, from new drugs approved to new studies on existing drugs. We also use this information to contact you regarding relevant Epocrates services and products. For instance, we may contact you (for example, by email or through PDA-based or desktop messaging products) to let you know that we have released a new product or service or a new version of an existing product, that there are new drug interactions of which you should be aware or that we are modifying one of our policies. We may also use contact and demographic information to send you materials from some of our partners or to invite you to provide us with feedback or to participate in a survey being conducted by one of our partners. If you do not wish to receive these kinds of emails, you may choose to opt out by updating your profile. Click here to learn more about "Choice and Access to Your Data."</p>

<h3><a name="track_use" id="track_use"></a>Does Epocrates track your use of its products?</h3>
<p>Epocrates does collect usage information about our products, such as which clinical messages have been read or what screens are viewed. We use this data to improve our subscribers’ experience and to prioritize new product development. For example, if such tracking data were to show that a significant number of our subscribers are accessing dosing information, we may decide to add additional or more extensive dosing calculators in future product updates.</p>
<p>Most importantly, WE DO NOT SELL PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION about your use of Epocrates products to anyone, including pharmaceutical companies, HMOs or others.</p>
<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/link_top.lbi" -->
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->

<h3><a name="how_protect" id="how_protect"></a>How does Epocrates protect your information?</h3>
<p>Epocrates safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. These procedures include limiting access to the information in various ways depending on the nature of the information as well as training our employees on the proper handling of subscriber information. While we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect the information that we have received, we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.</p>
<p>When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, we take extra steps to protect this data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>

<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->

<h3><a name="will_share" id="will_share"></a>Will Epocrates share the information it collects with others?</h3>
<p>As a rule, Epocrates does not share or sell our subscribers email addresses, we do not disclose the identity of our subscribers; and most importantly, we do not disclose information on how subscribers are using Epocrates products except in aggregate or non-personally identifiable form. Such tracking data is used internally by Epocrates primarily for developing and enhancing products and improving technical usability. For more information, refer to "How does Epocrates use the information we collect?"</p>
<p>However, we obviously must disclose certain information to credit card processors when you make an online purchase. The service providers we use are not permitted to use your information for any secondary purposes. Epocrates may also disclose personal information as allowed or required by applicable law, including making disclosures that are necessary or advisable to: (a) protect the rights, safety or property of subscribers of our web site and products, the public, or Epocrates, and (b) conform to legal or regulatory requirements. No other disclosures of personally identifiable information will be made without your prior consent.</p>
<p>Epocrates may provide aggregate or non-personally identifiable statistics about our customers, sales, product usage or traffic patterns, and related site information, but these statistics will not include any personally identifying information. For example, we may share aggregated demographic data about our subscribers, such as the number of Epocrates subscribers in California or that psychiatrists have more need for drug interaction information relating to psychotropic drugs than primary care practitioners.</p>
<p>Please be assured, however, that we do not sell your name, e-mail address or contact information, software usage information or any other personally identifiable information to outside or third parties.</p>

<h3><a name="how_access" id="how_access"></a>Choice and Access to Your Information</h3>
<p>Epocrates tries to provide you with relevant information on a variety of topics through our newsletters and other email communications. At the same time, we understand that not every subscriber is interested in all of the information and opportunities we offer. So that you may customize your experience with Epocrates, we ask you to select the types of email that you want to receive. The initial selection is made during the registration process, but you can opt into or out of any of these email services at any time by updating your profile as described below. Go to the bottom of the form and make the selection of your choices, if you select a box, you will NOT receive emails of the type listed.</p>
<p>You also have the option of correcting, updating and/or changing contact and demographic information and other matters previously provided and stored on our database. If you wish to correct, update or change your information, simply update your profile.</p>
<p>To update your profile, please log in from the home page of our website at http://www.epocrates.com/ using your Epocrates username and password. Then, click "My Profile" and provide or edit the appropriate information.</p>

<h3><a name="cookies_links" id="cookies_links"></a>Cookies, Links and Other Matters</h3>
<h4>What about "cookies" and web server log files?</h4>
<p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We use both session and persistent cookies on our website to help us provide you with more personalized service. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that if you would rather not store the information for future use. Disabling cookies in your browser may prevent access to some parts of our site.</p>
<p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather and use certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information as part of our Web site analysis and to prevent fraud or abuse of our system.</p>
<h4>What about links to other sites?</h4>
<p>The Epocrates website contains links to or from other sites. Epocrates does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.</p>
<h4>What about changes to this statement?</h4>
<p>The Epocrates Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time.</p>
<p>By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Epocrates as disclosed in this statement. If we decide to materially change our privacy practices, we will post a prominent notice of those changes on the homepage and/or send an email so that you are always kept informed of what data we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Please check this page for changes from time to time to make sure you are aware of our latest privacy practices.</p>

<h3><a name="terms" id="terms"></a>Important Terms</h3>
<p>In this policy, when we use the term "we" or "our", we mean both Epocrates and third parties with whom Epocrates contracts to assist in its business operations. These contractors may, however, only access your information in furtherance of their services to Epocrates and may not use or disclose your information except as permitted by Epocrates.</p>
<h4>What is "personally identifiable" information?</h4>
<p>When reviewing any privacy policy on the Internet, you should be familiar with the terms "personally identifiable" and "non-personally identifiable" information. "Personally identifiable information" is any information that can be used to identify, contact or locate you as an individual, as well as any additional data tied to such information. Common examples are your name and email address, along with purchase information associated with those fields. Non-personally identifiable information is information-either in "profile" or "aggregate" form-that, in contrast, is not intended to identify you as an individual. For instance, we may store a profile of an oncologist in New York without tying this information to a name, address or other personally identifiable information. We may also aggregate information to produce general data, such as figures that show that half of our subscribers are over thirty-five years old.</p>
