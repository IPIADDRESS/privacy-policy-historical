<h4>PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
                        
<p>
Online privacy is constantly evolving and Epoch plans to take
all reasonable efforts to maintain up to date and effective online
privacy standards and practices. We have linked every page of our
website ("Website") to this page for your convenience and you may also
contact us at <a class="style3" href="mailto:legal@epoch.com">legal@epoch.com</a> 
with any questions or concerns that you may have.
</p>

<p>
Epoch is committed to respecting your online privacy and
recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of any
personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share
with us. In order to provide payment processing, billing and fraud
detection services, Epoch collects and uses your Personal
Information. Personal Information means any information that may be
used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first
and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or
other contact information, whether at work or at home, a credit card
information, and Website passwords. This policy explains how we intend
to treat your Personal Information.
</p>

<p>
If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on our
Website, we may transfer that Information within Epoch or to
Epoch's third-party service providers, across borders, and from
your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions 
around the world.
</p>

<p>
Epoch strives to comply with all applicable laws around the
globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal
requirements may vary from country to country, Epoch intends to
adhere to the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy even if, in
connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from
your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of
protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is
to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where
that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained. 
</p>


                        
                        <p class="style1">To protect your
privacy, we have adopted the following principles:</p>


                        
                        <p><span class="style1"> *

                        <p><span class="style6"></span></p><h5>NOTICE</h5>


                        <span class="style1"><b>Information Collection</b></span><p></p>


                        
                        <p class="style1">You may access
and browse our Website without disclosing any Personal Information.
However, if you attempt to use Epoch's services to purchase a
product or service online, Epoch may request that you
voluntarily supply it with Personal Information. Epoch uses a
secure transmission method for all of its transmissions. Epoch receives and stores all information that
you enter in our Website and billing pages. In addition, Epoch
collects information about you during your visit, such as your IP
Address and Epoch employs its software in order to ascertain
your physical location when making a purchase. Except as set forth
below, Epoch does not collect information from sources such as
public records, or private organizations. However, Epoch does
collect personal information you submit to its clients in order to
complete transactions. You are required to provide Epoch and
its clients with accurate and up to date information, and your failure
to accurately provide such information could result in the voiding of
your agreement(s) with Epoch.</p>


                        
                        <p class="style1"><b>Information Use</b><br>


Epoch is the sole owner of the information collected on its
Website. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to Third
Parties, except as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Epoch
shall release data when required by law, to enforce its agreement(s)
with you, or to enforce the contract rights of its clients.</p>


                        
                        <p class="style1"><b>Information Sharing</b><br>


We ensure that your Personal Information will not be disclosed to
anyone other than a government institution or authority when required
by law or other regulation, Epoch's affiliated merchant bank and
card processors as required to process transactions on a credit card,
and website owners/operators from which you are purchasing goods and
services using Epoch ("Third Parties").</p>


                        <br>
                        <p><span class="style6"></span></p><h5>CHOICE</h5>


                        <span class="style1">You may
choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to Epoch.
If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you
can still visit most of Epoch's Website, but you may be unable
to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our
interaction with you. If you chose to have a relationship with Epoch, such as a contractual or other business relationship or
partnership, you will be required to provide Personal Information in
connection with such relationship.</span><p></p>


                        <br>
                        <p><span class="style6"></span></p><h5>SECURITY</h5>


                        <span class="style1">We have
implemented security policies, rules and technical measures to protect
the Personal Information that we have under our control from
unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized
modification, unlawful destruction or accidental loss. Epoch
utilizes Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software when receiving and
transmitting electronic payments. Epoch encrypts the sensitive
information that you provide. Epoch reveals your credit card
number when communicating on a private dedicated line of communication
with our associated financial institution.
<br><br>

In addition, Epoch protects your Personal Information off-line.
All your information is restricted to our office. Security cards are
used to enter our facility. All employees and data processors, who have
access to and are associated with the processing of Personal
Information, are obliged to respect the confidentiality of our
visitors' Personal Information. Epoch conducts background and
credit checks on all of its employees prior to employment. Epoch 
employs a User ID and password scheme in order to limit and
achieve access to our computer network by our employees and Third
Parties.</span><p></p>


                        <br>
                        <p><span class="style6"></span></p><h5>ACCESS/ACCURACY</h5>


                        <span class="style1"><b>Access</b><br>


You may inquire about your Personal Information being held by Epoch by sending an email to <a class="style3" href="mailto:legal@epoch.com">legal@epoch.com</a>. Within a week,
Epoch shall provide you with a copy of the Personal Information
that it keeps about you. Epoch charges a $25 processing fee for
the request. Prior to completing your request, Epoch will
require that you provide us with proof of your identity. Epoch
reserves the right to refuse any request for information, though it
will communicate the reason for its decision.</span><p></p>


                        
                        <p class="style1"><b>Accuracy</b><br>


To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, Epoch wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information. Where we
collect Personal Information from you on our Website, our goal is to
provide a means of contacting us should you need to update or correct
that Personal Information. If for any reason those means are
unavailable or inaccessible, you may send updates and corrections about
your Personal Information to <a class="style3" href="mailto:legal@epoch.com">legal@epoch.com</a> and we will make
reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your Personal
Information that we hold as soon as practicable.</p>


                        
                        <p><span class="style6"><b>COOKIES</b></span><br>
