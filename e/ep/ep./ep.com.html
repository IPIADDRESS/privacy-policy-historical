<p></p><h2>Privacy Statement for EPage Auctions &amp; Classifieds</h2><p></p>


EPage has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our 
firm commitment to privacy.  The following discloses our information 
gathering and dissemination practices for this website: EPage 
Auctions &amp; Classifieds.
<p>
</p><p>
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, 
and to administer our Web site.    We use cookies to deliver content 
specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't 
have to re-enter it during any single visit to our site.
</p><p>
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information 
(like their name and email address).  The customer's contact information is 
used to contact the visitor when necessary.  Users may opt-out of receiving 
future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.  Unique identifiers (such 
as email address) are collected for use as account numbers in our record system.  
Contact information we may collect about you will only be used internally by
EPage and for billing matters.   Email addresses will never be sold or shared 
from your account information.  The only email you will receive will be directly
related to your account or advertisements.
</p><p>
This site contains links to other sites.  <b>EPage Auctions &amp; Classifieds</b> 
is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
</p><p>
</p><p>
EPage provides Auctions and Classifieds for tens of thousands of partners across the
Web.  EPage hosts all the ads and retains control of all data, including contact
information.  Our partners will not receive any personal information about any registered
user as part of this program.  The only information shared will be that which is already 
publicly accessible to general users of our site.
</p><p>
</p><p>
Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, 
and services.  We collect visitor's contact information (like their mailing 
address), unique identifiers (like their email address), and financial 
information (like their account or credit card numbers).  The customer's contact 
information is used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary.  Users may 
opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.  
Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products 
and services.  Unique identifiers (such as email addresses) are collected from 
Web site visitors for use as account numbers in our record system.  All 
information relating to your ad or location are purely used to help us serve 
classifieds and auctions in the best interests of our readers and advertisers.  
Contact information we may collect about you will only be used internally by EPage 
for billing matters.   Email addresses will never be sold or shared 
from your account information.  The only email you will receive will be directly
related to your account or advertisements.
</p><p>
Occassional online surveys ask visitors for financial and demographic information 
(like their zip code, age, and income level).  Users will not receive future mailings
as a result of these surveys.  Demographic and profile data is collected 
at our site and will be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.
</p><p>
We may use an outside ad company to display ads on our site.  These ads may 
contain cookies.  While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, 
cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and 
we do not have access to this information.

</p><h2>Security</h2>
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and 
alteration of the information under our control.  Account information is password
protected.  You must use a password to enter content, such as posting a classified

to the email address entered with the account.  When an account is created, a confirmation
message is sent to the account email address to insure its validity.  Confirmation
messages are sent out for many other actions as well, such as placing a classified ad,
and responding to an ad.
<p>
</p><h2>Choice/Opt-Out</h2>
