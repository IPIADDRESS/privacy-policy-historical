              BattleOn EpicDuel  encourages parents and legal guardians to spend  time online with their children. We urge parents and legal guardians to  instruct their children to never give out their personal information  online without permission. We also recognize a special need to protect  personal information obtained from children. In compliance with  Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ('COPPA'), we have adopted the  following policies regarding children under the age of 13 ('Children'):</p>
            <p><strong>Type and Use of Information Collected from Children</strong><br>
              To create a Free Account, BattleOn EpicDuel  does not collect or  require for the child to provide any personally identifiable  information if the child is known to BattleOn EpicDuel  to be under  the age of 13.<br>
              <br>
              To create a Subscriber Account, BattleOn EpicDuel  does require an  e-mail address as well as the parent’s correct billing information as  outlined under the Subscriber Accounts section.<br>
              <br>
              For Subscriber Accounts, we use your Subscriber e-mail address for the following purposes:</p>
            <ol>
              <li> To send a confirmation notice to the parent of their child's character registration and password information.</li>
              <li>Upon the parent’s request, to send the user password information when the child has lost or forgotten their password.</li>
              <li> In response to any questions, concerns or problems that a subscriber has contacted BattleOn EpicDuel  about.* </li>
              <li>To contact the parent about any problem with the child’s account or conduct in the game.</li>
              <li>To send out a newsletter to the subscriber email account**.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>*We  recognize that young children may inadvertently give out personal  information including their e-mail address when contacting us with any  questions, problems, or concerns they have encountered while playing  the game. We do not collect or use any such additional personal  information acquired in this manner unless it is necessary for us to  respond to the problem or question or concern. We reserve the right to  disclose your child's personally identifiable information as required  by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our  rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or  legal process served on our Web Sites. </p>
            <p>**  BattleOn EpicDuel  games are unique in a sense that we design and run  numerous special events that keep the game constantly fresh,  challenging, fun and interesting for our users. Some of these events  coincide with actual real life holidays, such as Valentine’s Day, other  events are made up as we go along. We use the newsletter to notify our  users of all the upcoming events, changes, improvements, upgrades, new  characters, etc. In addition, occasionally we may notify our users of  new products and services that BattleOn EpicDuel  has designed and  made available exclusively to our users. </p>
            <p>If  a child desires to upgrade his/her account to Subscriber Status, a  parent or legal guardian will be required to divulge additional  reasonably necessary information as described above under Subscriber  Accounts.<br>
              <br>
              BattleOn EpicDuel  does not  share, sell, rent or trade, your child’s personal information to any  third parties for their promotional purposes. </p>
            <p>BattleOn EpicDuel  does not condition a child’s participation in an online  activity on the child providing more personal information than is  reasonably necessary for the activity. In addition, Parent’s have the  right to consent to the website’s use of their child’s personal  information without having to consent to its disclosure of that  information to third parties. Parents may consent to the website’s use  of their child’s personal information, but request that such personal  information is not disclosed to third parties, by emailing us at <img src="../images/graphics/email.gif" alt="artix privacy email" align="absbottom" height="20" width="198"></p>
            <p><strong>Notification and Verifiable Parental Consent</strong><br>
              At this time, whenever BattleOn EpicDuel  is aware that a user is  under the age of 13, BattleOn EpicDuel  requires the child submit the  parent’s email address. We will then provide proper parental notice of  the child’s use of the site, including their username and password. For  Subscriber Accounts, the receipt of payment is considered actual,  verifiable consent from the parents to the child’s use of our website  and to any information that was divulged as reasonably necessary to  process payments, verify and maintain the account.</p>
            <p><strong>How can parents access, change or delete personally identifiable information about their children?</strong><br>
              Once again, we would like to assure you that we do not keep any  information other than what is listed above. However, parents are  welcome to contact us about any personally identifiable information  about their child by email. If your child's personally identifiable  information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may  correct, update, or delete it by making the change within the 'Account  Management' section of the site, or by contacting us at the email  address provided below.
