<br><br>

The service is ran by <a href="http://www.terrum.co.uk">Ben Gough / Terrum</a>, and solely by HIM, with no intention to move ownership at anytime or take responsibility for any impersonation that may be involved on phishing sites targeting our company. It is your responsibility to make sure you are at 'epichosts.co.uk' or 'www.epichosts.co.uk' for manual fraudulent checking so please check your address bar regularly.<br><br>Our security method is trusted with a DDoS mitigation and protection feature, related to any sorts of large attacks from many sources. It is setup to saturate uploads from many sources within a timeframe, then eventually block the sources. However, we are not responsible for any damage to your server or services, and we do not provide free backups of our services. Critical data of such should be kept in customers' safety for easy accessibility of having a backup of your service. Automatic backups can be provided with our services for an extra cost. If we find that your service is sending/receiving abusive packets, your account and service(s) will be terminated and your ISP may be notified. Any received attacks that are not properly taken care of by the customer, which are affecting our services, will also have to be suspended temporarily or terminated permanently.<br><br>The FTP Server is maintained by FileZilla, a highly secured and very lightweight server. For best use and compatibility, we recommend the <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client">FileZilla Client</a> to connect to our FTP.<br><br>The VPS' we host are unmanaged, which means customers are not covered for troubleshooting or extended support. This includes network issues, misconfigurations, script/program installations and other sorts technical help within the third-party Operating System of the VPS. If you require this sort of assistance, contact us for a quote.</p>

                                        <p class="p3">This genuine host accepts a 7 day money-back guarantee, within reason. If you are not satisfied we may ask how we can improve our services to convince you of our true services that you may not have experienced, in case one has misunderstood or gotten frustrated. We may also use your information for future purposes to help improve our support of hosting. The decision to whether you are applicable to a refund is always down to the administrator.<br><br>
