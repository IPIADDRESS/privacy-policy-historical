<h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>The Terms &amp; Conditions paragraphed below explains your agreement and the workings of the EpicHosts.co.uk website ("Site", "EpicHosts"). These Terms &amp; Conditions apply to the site and all products/services offered by EpicHosts. By successfully paying an EpicHosts invoice, therefore placing an order on our site, you oblige that you (each, "Client", "Customer", "Company") are legally bound in agreement to the terms and conditions written below:<br><br>

<h4>General Terms &amp; Conditions</h4>
EpicHosts is an internet and technology hosting company of which their main purpose is serving web hosting, VPSes, game servers, radio/voice servers and other virtual products. Our servers are located in UK, France, Germany and Canada, however the choice of country is limited to certain products.<br><br>

The business is run by ONE individual named Ben Gough ("Terrum"), registered as a sole trader with UK's tax firm; HMRC. At this time EpicHosts does not hire support or sales staff, therefore it is your responsibility to make sure you are communicating with EpicHosts staff only. We recommend checking your address bar to ensure you are only visiting 'epichosts.co.uk' or 'www.epichosts.co.uk' to avoid inaccurate, outdated or potentially fraudlent information along with any form of service we provide. We cannot be held responsible for any impersonators or any result caused by communication with impersonators.<br><br>

Our security consists of a DDoS mitigation and protection feature provided by CISCO, configured by the datacenter to withstand many various strengths and types of attacks. However, we are not responsible for any damage to your server or services caused by any attack, and we do not provide free backups of our services. Critical data as such should be kept in customers' safety away from our servers to ensure a customer does not lose their data during incidents including but not limited to an attack, outage, corruption or hardware failure. Automatic backups can be provided with our services for an extra cost.

We have an automated system in place to block any suspicious incoming/outgoing activity such as port scans, DDoS attacks and more. If we find that your service is sending/receiving abusive packets, your account and/or service(s) may automatically or manually become blocked or suspended/terminated, therefore disallow ANY access to the content or service by the client or visitors for the security of our services and clients. If multiple abusive have been issued, your service may be permanently terminated and any necessary authorities, along with your ISP, may become notified depending on the severity of the issue.<br><br>

The VPSes we host are unmanaged, unless the Managed VPS addon is purchased alongside with the VPS. Removal of the 'Terrum' account on your VPS, if applicable, is also a breach of our terms and can cause a suspension of your VPS. We require access to VPSes to perform security updates, network changes and other necessary changes that are either requested by the customer or our ISP. The creation of more than one user account per VPS or service is prohibited unless permission given otherwise.<br><br>

Our web hosting plans are not to be used for storage of data including but not limited to archives, music or videos and should only be used for website hosting content. This is monitored on a scheduled basis and, should we find any incriminating data, you may be contacted or your service automatically suspended. Please refer to the 'Termination and Suspension' section below for more information.<br><br>

<h4>Refunds</h4>
This genuine host accepts a 7 day money-back guarantee, within reason. If you are not satisfied we may ask for your opinion on improving our services, or encourage you of our true services that you may not have experienced, in case one has misunderstood or became frustrated. We may also use any non-personal information given through any communication method or dispute for training purposes, to help improve our support of hosting and other future purposes.<br><br>

The decision to whether you are eligible to a refund is always down to the staff of EpicHosts.<br><br>

The customer is responsible for the understanding of a properly described service, and the necessity of a service. Funds are held with us until a professional agreement is made with the outcome of the refund and/or request.<br><br>

A surcharge (processing fee) of 7% will be deducted from all refunds and transactions sent from us to a customer due to PayPal refund fees and other potential charges involved during the handling and/or funding of such service(s).<br><br>

Please note that Renewals, VPSes, Pre-installed services, Exchanged services, Domain names, Dedicated servers/machines, Backups and any of the hosting addons/plan-upgrades are non-refundable. This is due to the funds being instantly used for the activation of your service, licensing, IP rental and any other possible additions used to process your service. All other services NOT mentioned in this paragraph are refundable within the 7 day money-back guarantee mentioned above. <br><br>

<h4>Payment</h4>
You acknowledge that should we not receive renewal payment prior to the date of expiry we reserve the right to suspend services immediately without notice. Occasionally we may provide a 7 day grace period whereby we hold your information/data on our servers during suspension/expiration until renewal, but should this not apply to you or should the period expire without payment we reserve the right to purge all information/data pertaining to your account with us.<br><br>

A service along with any of its data can be destroyed without warning after expiration or during suspension to save resource or recycle stock for processing of future orders. We are entitled to recover (on a full indemnity basis) any costs and charges (including legal costs) incurred in recovering any amounts owed by you to EpicHosts.<br><br>

Any interlinking services, such as domains linked to web hosting, will be held by us until renewal or a related service has been purchased, as an interlinked service no longer belongs to a customer after expiration of its parent service.<br><br>

All payment methods are a one-off unless described otherwise (subscriptions, contracts, etc) which are handled by the merchants themselves. Therefore we do not possess the ability to process and/or charge or create transactions from your account - any subscriptions/contracts are an agreement between YOU and the MERCHANT. We cannot be responsible for ANY non-one-off payments that are left unattended or uncancelled as there is no way for EpicHosts staff to acknowledge a cancellation of a subscription/contract without prior notice. A customer must make sure to contact the appropriate payment merchant to cancel or postpone any automated payments before the end of any service's cycle as renewals are strictly non-refundable (See 'Refunds')<br><br>

<h4>Server maintenance</h4>
We might have, from time to time, to perform maintenance, upgrades or replacements of any hardware/software or content to our services and machines. We reserve the right to suspend access to any service during the required time to perform maintenance, upgrade or exchange the server, allowing us to quickly and safely finish the maintenance without any interruption or interference of a running service. Maintenance usually lasts no longer than a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the severity of the maintenance and whether it is planned or unplanned.<br><br>

Customers may be informed via e-mail of any planned maintenance. Any unplanned maintenance may be posted on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EpicHosts" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.<br><br>

<h4>Setup</h4>
It is our responsibility to ensure that any applied hosting package application is completed and activated ready for full use. After completion, all our services are unmanaged unless agreed that managed support will be given. We will not be responsible for any misconfigurations or loss of data due to unauthorised exposure or accidental damage. Re-installations and re-services can be quoted by contacting us for a fee. The customer assumes full responsibility for any third-party software installation and configuration on their service, with no guarantee of support from us for the appointed third-party software. Quoted times for account activation are estimates and, whilst we always do our best to get a service delivered on time, we do not promise activation within the quoted time frame. We may delay or refuse activation if:<br><br>

- Stock is being created,<br>
- A large queue of orders is undergoing,<br>
- Payment is not cleared or received in full,<br>
- We believe the order, information or payment is fraudulent,<br>
- You have any funds outstanding with relation to your current or any other account,<br>
- There is any reason which we deem your transaction as unsatisfactory to our terms or beliefs, of which reasoning would be dislosed with you.<br><br>

<h4>Termination and Suspension</h4>
You may request to have your hosting terminated (cancelled) at any time by advising us via a method of contact on our site. We will only process a refund if we find it is applicable to the state of your current service(s) with us.<br><br>

We may suspend any or all of your services, with or without compensation, where we have reason to suspect a violation of our terms and conditions whilst we investigate the suspected violation. We may also suspend your services where we have reason to suspect any type of illegitimate activity including, but not limited to, overdue invoices (lack of payment on any invoice without a notification of cancellation), unlawful content, copyright infringement, payment reversals, unfair usage and services affecting other customers or users on our servers. We reserve the full right to suspend a service at any time with the decision of its final status. You may also be charged an overdue/outstanding 'non-cancellation' fee for any suspended services that do not have a written cancellation logged.<br><br>

<h4>Violations</h4>
If a customer violates our terms and conditions we may terminate or suspend (temporarily or indefinitely) any services you have with us. In this case no refund will be given for any payments that have been, or are made, by the transactor to us.<br><br>

<h4>Changes to our Terms</h4>
If we decide to change our terms, we will update accordingly along with the modification date below. We reserve the full right to make changes to our Terms &amp; Conditions at any time, you also agree that all changes made to the terms are taken place immediately, without notification needed, towards all services.<br><br>
