<h3>EPIC Mailing List</h3>
   
   <blockquote>
  <p>If you are interested in receiving the EPIC Alert newsletter, we ask for 
    your email address so that we can send it to you. You can also read the EPIC 
    Alert by visiting the <a href="http://www.epic.org/alert/">EPIC Alert archive</a> 
    at our web site. The EPIC Alert mailing list is used only to mail the EPIC 
    Alert and to send notices about EPIC activities. We do not sell, rent or share 
    our mailing list. We also intend to challenge any subpoena or other legal 
    process seeking access to our mailing list. We do not enhance (link to other 
    databases) our mailing list or require your actual name. We will also use 
    this list for our annual contribution drive during the holiday season.</p>
   
   <p>In the event you wish to update or delete an email address in
   our possession at any time for any reason, please contact
   <a href="mailto:epic-info@epic.org">epic-info@epic.org</a> to
