						<p>
    Thank you for visiting a Defy Media, LLC website (the “Site”)! The Site is strongly committed to protecting your privacy. The purpose of this privacy<br>
    policy is to inform users of the Site as to what information we collect and how and why we use such information.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Disclosure Regarding Collection and Use of Personal Information.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Through the Site, including any mobile version thereof, users may enter personal information about themselves. This policy explains our online information<br>
    collection and use practices and the choices you can make about the way we use and share such information. Please take the time to read and understand this<br>
    policy so that you can understand how we use your personal information. Please note that our online information collection and use practices may differ<br>
    from our practices regarding information obtained offline.
</p>
<p>
    REMEMBER: IF YOU MAKE USE OF THE SITE, REGISTER WITH THE SITE, REQUEST INFORMATION THAT WE MAY OFFER, OR SUBMIT INFORMATION IN ANY WAY TO OR THROUGH THE<br>
    SITE YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS. AS WE UPDATE AND EXPAND OUR SERVICES, THIS POLICY MIGHT CHANGE, SO PLEASE REVIEW IT FROM TIME TO TIME.
</p>
<p>
    <b>The Information We Collect.</b>
</p>
<p>
    We may collect information about you through a variety of methods, such as your participation in games, quizzes, contests, chat rooms, forums or the like<br>
    or other documents that you submit to us, transactions in which you may engage with us or our affiliated companies (“Affiliates”), or through visits that<br>
    you may make to the Site, including via our mobile applications. This policy applies to all personally identifiable information that we collect and<br>
    maintain about our users in connection with providing services, such as:
</p>
<p>
    · Your contact information (such as name, Twitter handle, postal and email address, or phone number);
</p>
<p>
    · Username and password for the account you may establish on our sites;
</p>
<p>
    · Demographic information (such as age, date of birth and gender);
</p>
<p>
    · Location information, such as the real-time geographic location of the device on which you install our mobile applications; and
</p>

    · Other details that you may submit to us or that may be included in the information provided to us by third parties.
</p>
<p>
    You may view or change your information at any time by <a href="mailto:webmaster@pophangover.com?subject=EpicWTFs: Support">contacting us</a>.
</p>
<p>
    You also can engage with our content, such as video, games, applications, and other offerings, on or through third-party social networking sites, such as<br>
    Facebook or third-party social media plug-ins and applications. When you engage with our content on or through third party social networking sites,<br>
    plug-ins and applications, you may allow us to have access to certain information from your social media profile (e.g., your name, e-mail address, photo,<br>
    gender, birthday, location, list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the ‘likes’ you make) to deliver the content or as part<br>
    of the operation of the application. We may also obtain non-personally identifiable information (e.g., content viewed, games played and performance, high<br>
    scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on,) from your interaction with our content.
</p>
<p>
    When you provide information from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like: (i) give you exclusive content; (ii) personalize your<br>
    online experience with us within and outside our applications or websites; and (iii) contact you through the social networking sites or directly by sending<br>
    you the latest news, special offerings, and rewards. By doing so, you consent to the use of this information in accordance with our privacy policy. When<br>
    you provide personal information to us through an application, on our sites, or on social networking sites, it may be publicly viewed by other members of<br>
    these sites and we cannot prevent further use of the information by third parties.
</p>
<p>
    Through some social networking sites’ privacy settings, you can control what data you share. For more information about how social networking sites handle<br>
    your personal information, please refer to their respective privacy policies and terms of use.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Other Collected Information</b>
</p>
<p>
    We also may use third-party website analytics tools (such as Omniture or Google), that collect information about visitor traffic on our sites and mobile<br>
    applications. The information we may collect by automated means includes:
</p>
<p>
    · Information about the devices our visitors use to access the Internet (such as the IP address and the device, browser and operating system type);
</p>
<p>
    · URLs that refer visitors to the Site;
</p>
<p>
    · Dates and times of visits to the Site;
</p>
<p>
    · Information on actions taken on the Site (such as page views and site navigation patterns)

<p>
    · A general geographic location (such as country and city) from which a visitor accesses our Site; and

</p>
<p>
    <b>How We Use Your Personal Information.</b>
</p>
<p>
    We use your personal information to provide you with products or services that you have requested, to respond to questions or communications and to get in<br>
    touch with you when necessary. For example, we may use your personal information to communicate with you or to send you information that you have<br>
    requested. Additionally, by registering for the Site you will be automatically entered into sweepstakes and contests held on the Site. Except as otherwise<br>
    set forth on the Site, in addition, we may send to you an e-mail offering products or services which we think you may be interested in or to ask you to<br>
    participate in a survey. We do not consider any companies that are within our “family” of companies to be “third parties” for purposes of this policy.<br>
    Thus, we may also share personal information provided online with Defy Media, LLC (“Defy”) Affiliates. Any of these companies may use and further share<br>
    this information in the same ways we do. However, if we pass on personal information to a family company, we require that it protect such information in a<br>
    manner that is consistent with this policy and your expressed preferences. For example, a family company may send to you an e-mail regarding special offers<br>
    and announcements about products or services that it thinks might be of interest to you. A family company may also contact you offline. If you want to<br>
    opt-out from our (or a family company) using the personal information you provided in these ways, please <a href="mailto:webmaster@pophangover.com?subject=EpicWTFs: Support">contact us</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Updating or Removing Your Personal Information.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Please <a href="mailto:webmaster@pophangover.com?subject=EpicWTFs: Support">contact us</a> at any time to update or change your personal information.
</p>
<p>
   <b>How We Share Your Personal Information.</b>
</p>
<p>
    We will not share with third parties the personal information you provide except (a) if it is for the purpose(s) you provided it; (b) with your consent;<br>
    (c) as may be required by law or as we think necessary to protect our company or others from injury (e.g. in response to a court order or subpoena, in<br>
    response to a law enforcement agency request or when we believe that someone is causing (or about to cause) injury to or interference with the rights or<br>
    property of another); (d) with other persons, service providers or companies with whom we contract to carry out internal site operations or our business<br>
    activities (for example, sending out a product or a promotional item that you have requested on the Site); and/or (e) notifying you when we make material<br>
    changes to one of our subscriber agreements or this policy. Examples of us sharing your personal information for the purposes submitted are if you<br>
    participate in a third-party survey or request information from a third-party, we may provide the information provided to such third party so that they can<br>
    send to you directly the information you requested. We will seek to obtain your consent at the place where the information is collected either by an<br>
    “opt-in” or “opt-out” method, or by other means (such as sending to you an e-mail). As stated above, we do not consider any companies that are within our<br>
    “family” of companies to be “third parties” for purposes of this policy and may also share personal information provided online with Defy Affiliates. Any<br>
    of these companies may use and further share this information in the same ways we do. However, if we pass on personal information to an Affiliate, we<br>
    require that it protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy. If you want us to stop sharing your personal information among<br>
    Defy Affiliates, please <a href="mailto:webmaster@pophangover.com?subject=EpicWTFs: Support">contact us</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, with your consent, we may share the personal information you provide online with companies not affiliated with us (i.e. third party<br>
    companies) who are interested in marketing their products or services to you or in asking you questions, both online and offline. We will seek to obtain<br>
    your consent either by an “opt-in” or “opt-out” method, or by other means (such as sending to you an e-mail). Companies with whom we might share your<br>
    personal information may include consumer products, telecom, financial, military, market research, entertainment, and educational services companies and<br>
    their third party service providers. If you want us to stop sharing your personal information with these companies, please <a href="mailto:webmaster@pophangover.com?subject=EpicWTFs: Support">contact us</a>. If you consent to receiving communications from non-affiliated companies, you may need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no<br>
    longer wish to receive their communications or if you wish to change any data you provided online. In this instance, any changes or amendments to your<br>
    personal information must be given directly to each company who communicates with you as these changes, amendments and/or deletions will not be exchanged<br>
    between us and non-affiliated companies.
</p>
<p>
    If we do share personal information with a non-affiliated company, to the extent practical, we require that they protect such information in a manner that<br>
    is consistent with this policy. We cannot, however, guarantee how these non-affiliated companies will use your personal information.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Personal Information Gathered Under Previous Versions of This Privacy Policy.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Personal information collected via the Site will generally be governed by the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the information was<br>
    gathered. We will not retroactively make material changes to the way we use personally identifiable information collected under previous versions of this<br>
    Privacy Policy without obtaining your consent.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Information.</b>
</p>
<p>
    We sometimes use the non-personal information that we collect to improve the design and content of the Site and to enable us to personalize your Internet<br>
    experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze how the Site is used, as well as to offer you products, programs or services.<br>
    Sometimes we share aggregate information with others, including Affiliates and non-affiliated companies.
</p>
<p>

    If you would prefer not to receive marketing or promotional e-mails from us that may relate, for example, to new services or offerings, you may opt-out of<br>

    telephone or facsimile, nor will we be responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly or lack complete information. Please note that we may<br>
    require up to sixty (60) days to fully remove your postal mail information from our mailings.
</p>
<p>
    Following your opt-out, please be aware that we, or our Affiliates, may continue to contact you via email or postal mail for administrative or<br>
    informational purposes, including, but not limited to, follow-up messages regarding the administration of your account, any services, features or functions<br>
    you have affirmatively enrolled in or registered to use, any promotions or sweepstakes you have participated in or have entered, goods, services or<br>
    products you have ordered or other transactions you have undertaken on the Site.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Collection of Information By Others.</b>
</p>
<p>
    The Site may contain links to other websites, including links that are placed there by us, such as third-party advertisements or text hyperlinks. Please be<br>
    aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any other website. We encourage all users of the Site to be aware of when they leave the<br>
    Site, and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects personal information. This privacy policy applies solely to information<br>
    collected by the Site, through the Site. We may offer additional e-mail services or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with non-affiliated<br>
    companies. Based on our agreement with them, these third parties may obtain personal information that site visitors voluntarily submit to participate in<br>
    the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. We have no control over the use of this information by these companies.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Online Tracking and Advertising.</b>
</p>
<p>
    We collect information regarding the Site visitors through various technologies, such as cookies, Flash cookies and Web beacons, including when you visit<br>
    our sites and applications or use our applications on third-party sites or platforms. Please visit <a href="http://www.pophangover.com/online-tracking-and-advertising/">Online Tracking and Advertising</a> for further information regarding this collection and usage, including how to disable cookies.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Clickstream Data.</b>
</p>
<p>
    As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as<br>
    “Clickstream Data,” can be collected and stored by a web site’s server. Clickstream Data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and<br>
    the address of the web site from which you linked to the Site. We may use Clickstream Data as a form of non-personal information to anonymously determine<br>
    how much time visitors spend on each page of the Site, how visitors navigate throughout the Site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the<br>
    needs of visitors. This information will only be used to improve the Site. Any collection or use of Clickstream Data will be anonymous and aggregate.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Supplementing Information.</b>
</p>
<p>
    From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address. Thus,<br>
    information we obtain through the Site may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Site,<br>
    including both offline and online sources.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Discussions and Community Tools.</b>
</p>
<p>
    We may, from time to time, make review lists, chat rooms, forums, message boards, blogs, newsgroups and other community tools available to you. Please<br>
    remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information for other users to view and for us to use. For example, from time<br>
    to time, we may use the content you write (including your name or screen name if you post it) for promotional purposes, in e-mail newsletters or elsewhere,<br>
    and by using the Site and/or these chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups, and other community tools, you agree that we may do so. You should<br>
    exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in these areas, since anyone – not just us – may access your publicly posted<br>
    information.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Our Commitment to Security.</b>
</p>
<p>
    We believe we have in place the appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain<br>
    data security and correctly use the information we collect online. Whenever personal information is passed on to non-affiliated companies, to the extent<br>
    practical, we require that they also have in place the appropriate safeguards. We cannot, however, guarantee that they do so.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Notice to California-Based Users.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, if you are a resident of California, you may make a written request to the Site about how we have shared your<br>
    personal information during the prior calendar year with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. In response to your written request, under<br>

    Choice Notice”. For purposes of this California Privacy notice, third parties include companies within our “family” of companies, such as Defy Affiliates.
</p>

    The California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to<br>
    know how the Site responds to “Do Not Track” browser settings. The Site does not currently take action to respond to Do Not Track signals, as a uniform<br>
    technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and reserve the right to adopt a standard once one is created.

<p>
    <b>International Users.</b>
</p>
<p>
    If you are visiting the Site from a location outside of the United States, your connection will be through and to servers located in the United States and<br>

    ADDITION, IF YOU ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, THE LAWS OF WHICH<br>
    MAY BE DEEMED BY OTHER COUNTRIES TO HAVE INADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION (see, for example, European Union Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995, a copy of<br>
    which can be found <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:HTML">here</a>). Users of the Site located in<br>
    countries outside of the United States of America who submit personal information do thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in<br>
    this privacy policy and to the transfer of that information to and/or storage of the information in the United States of America. This policy and our legal<br>
    obligations are subject to the laws of the State of New York and the United States of America, regardless of the location of any user. Any claims or<br>
    complaints must be filed in the United States of America in the State of New York.

<p>
    <b>Special Note for Parents.</b>
</p>
<p>
    We will not knowingly accept personal information from anyone under 13 years old in violation of applicable law. If you believe that your child under 13<br>
    has gained access to the Site without your permission, please <a href="mailto:webmaster@pophangover.com?subject=EpicWTFs: Support">contact us</a>. We have taken commercially reasonable steps to restrict use of the Site to those who are at least 13 years old. We do not market products or services for<br>
    purchase by children and all children’s products or services we market are for purchase by adults only, or with adult permission.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Transfer of Business Assets.</b>
</p>
<p>
    The personal information you provide is considered a company asset and may be included among transferred assets if the Site, we, or parent(s) or any or all<br>
    of Affiliates or any of our assets are ever acquired by a third party.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Changes to this Policy.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Because our business needs may change over time, we reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this policy at<br>
    any time. If at any time in the future we plan to use your personal information in a way that differs from this policy, we will revise this policy as<br>
    appropriate. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of any changes to this policy means you accept such changes. This policy is effective as<br>
    of 1/1/2014.
