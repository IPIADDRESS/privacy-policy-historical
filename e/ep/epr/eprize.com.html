<div class="entry-content privacy-policy_home">
	<h4>ePrize, <span class="caps">LLC</span> Privacy Policy (last revised: October 27, 2008)</h4>

	<p>ePrize, <span class="caps">LLC</span> is a company that helps other businesses operate sweepstakes, contests and promotions (“Promotions”). In addition, ePrize occasionally runs its own Promotions. Such Promotions gather personally identifiable information from those individuals who choose to enter a particular Promotion and anonymous data regarding the Promotion itself. ePrize takes its privacy obligations both to its clients and to people who enter its Promotions very seriously. ePrize adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles as established by the European Commission and the United States Department of Commerce. </p>

	<p>This policy outlines our treatment of personally identifiable information we collect on behalf of our clients and for our own use. There are three types of Promotions in which ePrize is involved: 1) Client Promotions; 2) ePrize “Opt-in” to Client Promotions; and 3) ePrize Promotions. </p>

	<p><ins>Client Promotions</ins>: As a full service promotions and sweepstakes agency, ePrize operates Promotions on behalf of its clients. As part of those services, ePrize collects personally identifiable information for its clients by use of ePrize’s proprietary online technology, ePrize mailboxes, and points of entry offline. ePrize collects such personally identifiable information solely for the use of its clients and the operation of the Promotions. ePrize does not use any of the data collected itself, other than to notify potential winners and for prize fulfillment purposes in connection with a Promotion. ePrize does not consolidate data across different clients’ Promotions, does not maintain data beyond the conclusion of client Promotions (other than for back-up purposes on its client’s behalf), and does not “monetize” data collected on behalf of its clients in any manner whatsoever. ePrize strictly limits access to all personally identifiable information within its organization, and data is never shared outside of the company for any reason whatsoever (with, of course, the exception of appropriate governmental or legal requests). Personally identifiable information collected from different client Promotions is never mingled or shared with anyone other than the client on whose behalf the information was collected. Personally identifiable information collected by ePrize on behalf of a client belongs solely to the client and will be used solely in accordance with that particular client’s Privacy Policy. An individual’s desire to “opt-out” of receiving marketing or other information from a client will be handled in accordance with a particular client’s Privacy Policy. ePrize requires its clients, by contract, to use the data which ePrize collects on its behalf in accordance with generally accepted privacy standards for both offline and online data, which includes an “opt-out” method for individuals who have provided personally identifiable information. Ultimately, however, ePrize is not responsible for data collected on behalf of its clients when such data is in its client’s possession. Where ePrize operates one Promotion on behalf of multiple clients, the use of the personally identifiable information by all of the companies involved will be clearly outlined by a Privacy Policy created for that Promotion.</p>

	<p><ins>ePrize “Opt-in” to Client Promotions</ins>: From time to time, ePrize and one of its clients will agree to allow ePrize to offer entrants to a Promotion an opportunity to “opt-in” to receiving marketing information from ePrize and its partners. In such cases, on the Promotion registration page, an ePrize “opt-in” question will appear clearly explaining to potential entrants that by checking the box they will be agreeing to share their personally identifiable information with ePrize. If there is not an ePrize “opt-in” question on the registration form, ePrize will not share or use any of the data collected whatsoever. When individuals “opt-in” to receive information from ePrize, they are agreeing to receive email and other notices from ePrize, including marketing messages, surveys, special offers and notices about other Promotions. Such notices may come from ePrize itself, companies with whom ePrize has a business relationship and/or ePrize clients. <br>
If you want to “opt-out” of receiving such notices from ePrize after you have “opted-in”, or you wish to correct the information you have provided to ePrize, you may do so in one of two (2) ways: </p>

	<ol>
		<li>Please send an email to remove@eprize.com. Please make sure to include the name of the promotion in the subject line and in the body of the email from which you wish to opt-out. Failure to provide this information may delay the processing of your request.</li>
		<li>Mail the details of your request to:
	<ul>
		<li>Privacy Policy c/o ePrize, <span class="caps">LLC</span></li>
		<li>One ePrize Drive</li>
		<li>Pleasant Ridge, MI 48069</li>
	</ul></li>
	</ol>

	<p><ins>ePrize Promotions</ins>: ePrize also runs Promotions on its own behalf. Such Promotions are to generate interest from other businesses in ePrize’s products and services. ePrize uses the personally identifiable information collected in such Promotions as sales leads and may contact the individual registrants by email, mail or phone. ePrize will never sell such information or share it with another business. When individuals “opt-in” to receive information from ePrize, they are agreeing to receive email and other notices from ePrize, including marketing messages, surveys, special offers and notices about other Promotions. Such notices may come from ePrize itself or from ePrize on behalf of companies with whom ePrize has a business relationship. If you want to “opt-out” of being contacted by ePrize after you have participated in one of its Promotions, or you wish to correct the information you have provided to ePrize, you may do so in one of two (2) ways: </p>

	<ol>
		<li>Please send an email to remove@eprize.com. Please make sure to include the name of the promotion in the subject line and in the body of the email from which you wish to opt-out. Failure to provide this information may delay the processing of your request.</li>
		<li>Mail the details of your request to:
	<ul>
		<li>Privacy Policy c/o ePrize, <span class="caps">LLC</span></li>
		<li>One ePrize Drive</li>
		<li>Pleasant Ridge, MI 48069</li>
	</ul></li>
	</ol>

	<p><ins>ePrize’s Online Promotion Technology</ins>: ePrize’s proprietary Promotion technology has the ability to collect data other than personally identifiable information for any of the three (3) kinds of Promotions it operates online.  ePrize may collect information about your computer configuration, such as your browser type, operating system, or <span class="caps">ISP</span> domain name. ePrize may collect information about the site you last visited prior to the Promotion or about your activity during your visit to the Promotion site. This information will not reveal your personal identity (it is anonymous), may be used by ePrize to administer the technical and operational aspects of this site, and may include using your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server. Your IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. ePrize may use a cookie, a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user, to assist in performing some or all of these activities and also to limit your ability to play a Promotion more times than allowed. You can set your browser to accept all, some, or no cookies. If you set your browser to reject all cookies, you may be limited in your ability to access some, or all aspects of a particular Promotion. </p>

	<p><ins>Special Note about Children</ins>: Unless otherwise specifically indicated, ePrize Promotions are not available to anyone under the age of thirteen (13). ePrize does, however, operate some Promotions on behalf of its clients which collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13). In each such instance, ePrize and its clients comply fully with all aspects of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act  (“<span class="caps">COPPA</span>”) in the operation of the Promotion, in the collection of the information itself and in the subsequent use of the data collected. Personally identifiable information will not be collected from children under the age of thirteen (13) without parental consent in compliance with the <span class="caps">COPPA</span> guidelines.</p>

	<p><ins>Your California Privacy Rights (As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)</ins>: A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. </p>

	<p>However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.  </p>

	<p><ins>Contact ePrize</ins>: If you wish to contact ePrize to correct, amend, or delete information (if ePrize is holding on to your information as explained above), about privacy related issues or for any reason at all, you may do so in one of two (2) ways</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Mail the details of your request to:
	<ul>
		<li>Privacy Policy c/o ePrize, <span class="caps">LLC</span></li>
		<li>One ePrize Drive</li>
		<li>Pleasant Ridge, MI 48069 or</li>
	</ul></li>
		<li>Email to: privacy@eprize.com</li>
	</ol>

	<p><ins>Material Changes to Policy</ins>: ePrize may make material changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. Therefore, you should periodically visit this page to view the current Privacy Policy. In the event of a material change to this Privacy Policy, ePrize shall send an email advising of the change to all persons whose email addresses we have collected and retained pursuant to the terms set forth above.</p>
