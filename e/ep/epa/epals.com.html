<p>We never share the personal information of children under 13 with any third parties.</p>

<p>At ePALS, we are committed to protecting your children's privacy while we offer students and schools the full global experience offered by the Internet.  Our service fosters communication among parents, students and educators all around the world, and we explain all our interactive features in this policy.  We also explain what information we collect from children, and at the end of the policy, what different information we may collect from adults like teachers and parents.  We never condition a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.</p>


<h3>REGISTRATION PROCESS</h3>

<p>Members can register in two ways - either directly or through their teacher or parent.</p>

<p>Members who register directly are asked to fill out a form that requests their full name and their email address. They are also asked to pick a username and password and to indicate their status (student, educator, or parent).  In order to determine whether we need to obtain parental consent under U.S. law, we also ask for their birthdate and their country. If their birthdate shows that they are under 13, they are then asked for their parent's email address so that consent can be requested.  At this page, we also ask if the user wishes to receive our Newsletter.</p>

<p>For those in the United States who told us they were under 13 the self pre-registration process stops here.  We then send an email to the parent, requesting that the parent register their child and consent that their child become a member of ePALS.  We do not activate the user name, open an email account, send a newsletter, or otherwise permit the child to become a member until we have received verifiable parental consent.  If we do not receive consent within 21 days, we delete all of the information we collected from your child. </p>

<p>In order to give consent, either call us toll free at 1-888-450-2332 and follow the instructions given, or simply print the attached parental consent form, fill it out, sign it and fax it to 1-888-201-2332 or mail it to:</p>

ePALS Classroom Exchange<br>
Box 8202<br>
5325 Elkhorn Blvd.<br>
Sacramento, California<br>
95842<br>

<p>Detailed instructions on what information must be provided can be found in the attached parental permission slip. In addition to the information we collected from your child, we ask you to provide your name, your email address, your city, and a three digit pin number for identification purposes. Once we have received the consent, your child's membership will be activated by an ePALS staff member. </p>

<p>We also permit teachers to register their students/classrooms. For students who are under 13, we instruct the teachers to print out the privacy policy and parental consent form, and obtain written parental consent.  Once they have verified to us that they have received written parental consent, we permit them to register their students and create accounts for them, with access to all the features described below. </p>

<p>Members whose birthdates show they are over 12 are taken to a second registration page, where they give us their city, and have the option of providing us with their street address, state or province, and zip or postal code. Their mailing address may be used to send a print version of the ePALS Newsletter, and makes it possible to generate customized street maps on the user's ePALS Settings page.   Once this page is completed, the registration process is complete.</p>

<p>Once registered with parental consent, children under 13 have the option of providing us with their mailing address at the Settings page of their account. This makes it possible to generate customized street maps on the user's ePALS Settings page. </p>

<p>We protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of the personal information we collect. This information is maintained on secure servers and is only accessible to qualified ePALS personnel who require this information. </p>

<h3>MEMBERSHIP FEATURES</h3>

<p>An ePALS membership comes with access to our interactive features such as email, chat rooms (public and private), and discussion boards. As with other typical email accounts, chat rooms and online discussion groups, children may disclose personal information (about themselves, their parents, friends or acquaintances) with their correspondents and in the online forums. Accordingly, parents should advise their children not to give out any personal information without the parents' consent.</p>

<h4>Email</h4>

<p>Registered ePALS members are given an unrestricted ePALS Webmail account (e.g., username@epals.com).  With this kind of account, members can send and receive emails from anyone. Children under the age of 13 cannot register an unrestricted Webmail account unless their parent consents to the registration.</p>

<p>We also offer parents the option of providing their children with our Teacher/Parent Monitored Email account, for those who want control of the email account to be in adult hands.  With Monitored Email, an adult creates an email account for the child or student, and then can  preview and approve every message sent to or from the child before it reaches its recipient.  With Monitored Email, the individual who creates the monitored account is the only one who has access to and control over the account, until or unless it gets moved to another individual. The person who is monitoring the account has total discretion over how tightly to control the account. The default setting is that every message must be seen by the Monitor before it reaches its recipient. However, the Monitor can reduce the level of control, even turning filtering off altogether if desired. If the Monitor is a teacher, then parents are not  involved in the process, unless the teacher wants to inform the parent themselves.</p>

<p>If you want to create  an unrestricted ePALS Webmail account for your child 12 and under, you must first have an account with ePALS. Then, create a Monitored account by following the "Monitored Email" link in the main navigation and select the checkbox to turn off all filters. If you later wish to reactivate filters for this account, you can do so at any time from your Email account settings. Alternatively, if your child is over 12, your child can create their own unrestricted account at ePALS. </p>

<p>If you want your child to receive a Monitored Email account, you must first have an account with ePALS. Then, create a Monitored account by following the "Monitored Email" link in the main navigation and proceed through the Monitored Account creation process. The Monitored account you create will automatically be assigned to you and be your responsibility.  Please note that even if you create a Monitored account, a child over 12 will still be able to register themselves and create an unrestricted account under a different username.</p>

<p>For Monitored accounts, the parent or teacher creating the account inputs the first and last name of the child who will use the account, and a password.  Our computer will propose a username, which is typically some combination of the user's first name and some letters of the last name or numbers.  In no event will the username proposed be the user's full name.  The adult creating the account can change the username at the account registration phase.  The username cannot be changed after that -- but the account can be deleted and a new account, with the chosen user name, can be created.  The first time the child signs on, they will be asked to pick a new password, so they will have access to the account. </p>

<h4>Electronic greeting cards</h4>

<p>ePALS members can send electronic greeting cards, or eCards, to anyone whose email address they know. eCards consist of an image supplied by ePALS, and space for a greeting and personal message. The recipient receives an email notification to view the card (which includes the email address of the sender) and is given a URL to visit where the card will be displayed. ePALS maintains the information required to send and display the eCard for a period of three months, after which all information is deleted. eCards can only be sent by ePALS members.  We will shortly be changing this feature so that users with monitored email accounts will be able to use this feature only as part of their monitored email account.  Until then, users under 13 will not be able to use this feature.  </p>

<p>We also send eCards to our members on their birthdate.</p>


<h4>Chat</h4>

<p>ePALS offers its registered members public chat rooms that are always open. They are arranged by topic, with teachers in one area, students in another, as well as general chat. The communication in those chat rooms are only intermittently reviewed  and all communications are instantly available for all other chat room participants to view (non-participants cannot view chatroom correspondence).  These unmoderated public chat rooms are only available to ePALS members over 12 years of age. </p>

<p>Our members are also able to create private chatrooms, with a name and password of their own choosing.  A member who creates such a chatroom can invite whomever they want to join the discussion simply by providing others with the name and password of the private chat room. Only ePALS members may participate, and  the private chatroom discussion is only available to the participants.</p>

<!--
[[h4]]Instant Messaging[[/h4]]

[[P]]Instant Messaging is similar to chat, but is for individuals only. A child under 13 can communicate through Instant Messaging only with their teacher, other students in their class (as decided by the child's teacher), or individuals whom they have specifically added to THEIR list OF INSTANT MESSAGE CORRESPONDENTS. [[B]]  [[/B]]If the child's account is monitored by a teacher or parent, that individual can access and alter the child's list. In the case of an unrestricted account, the user has total control over their own list.  It is only possible to contact someone through Instant Messaging if their username is known. [[/P]]

[[h4]]Bulletin Boards[[/h4]]

[[P]]ePALS has moderated Bulletin Boards, where new topics and messages can be suggested by ePALS members. All topics and statements are monitored and pre-screened by ePALS employees and are typically posted to the Bulletin Board within 24 hours. If Bulletin Board messages are deemed to be inappropriate at ePALS' sole discretion then they will either be edited or not be posted. ePALS does not allow the posting of personally identifiable information in Discussion Boards by those under 13 (beyond their ePALS username). This could include the child's first and last name, personal address, or other unique identifiers.[[/P]]
-->

<h4>Moderated Discussions </h4>

<p>ePALS occasionally offers moderated, real-time discussions on specific topics. Any ePALS member can participate in or view these discussions, which typically last from 1 to 2 hours. Every submission is previewed by an ePALS staff member before it is posted, and ePALS does not allow the posting of personally identifiable information in Moderated Discussions by those under 13 (beyond their ePALS username). This could include the child's first and last name, personal address, or other unique identifiers.</p>

<h4>Newsletters</h4>

<p>ePALS offers its members our monthly newsletter on new site features and general Internet and educational information.  Members can subscribe at registration by checking the appropriate box on their registration form. They can unsubscribe at any time by unchecking the appropriate box in their ePALS Settings page, or by following the unsubscribe link in every newsletter.  Once their membership is activated, users under 13 who signed up for the newsletter in the pre-registration process will receive it.</p>

<p>Students whose teachers are members, but who may not be members themselves, can also participate in some interactive functions at the ePALS site. </p>

<h4>Collaborative Projects <!--[and Video Conferencing] --></h4>

<p>In the course of using ePALS, teachers will often want to participate in collaborative projects with other classes. These projects could involve as many classes as the teacher wishes, and typically combine offline classwork with online collaboration. This collaboration could occur using any of our tools including email, voice or text chat<!--, or video conferencing where they can be seen and heard by others participating in the video conference-->.  These features are run by teachers through their own ePALS accounts. </p>


<!--
[[h4]]Class Websites[[/h4]]

[[P]]Teachers are given space on our servers to put up a class website. The contents of the site are previewed by ePALS staff before they are made live to ensure that no inappropriate content is displayed. In the event that the teacher wishes to display personally identifiable information or photographs of  class members, they will be instructed to first request written permission from those children's parents. Though we make every effort to ensure that no inappropriate content is displayed and will act to prevent the access of repeat offenders, ePALS is not responsible for copyright or other issues related to personal webpages. [[/P]]

<h3>PARENTAL REVIEW OF INFORMATION </h3>

<p>Parents can review their child's personal information at any time, and they can also have that information deleted and refuse to permit further collection of information by us. If you wish to view, delete or modify this information, simply contact ePALS support via a "feedback" link, and indicate the changes you wish made. If you want your child's personal information modified or deleted and their membership terminated, simply send your request to ePALS support. </p>

<h3>CO-BRANDED WE MEDIA SITE</h3>

<p>
We have joined with We Media to offer their users access to our site.  We will be sharing with We Media the registration information of all users who tell us they are 13 and older who come to us from the We Media site, as well as non-
personally identifiable aggregate demographic information. We Media will not reveal this information to any third parties. We will not share personally identifiable information of users who tell us they are younger than 13 with We Media or any third party.

<p>For the enjoyment of our members, we also link to other sites. We are not responsible for those other sites, and we advise you to check their privacy policies.</p>


<h3>COOKIES </h3>

<p>The ePALS website uses a software technology called "cookies" that helps us track non-personal, aggregate data about our visitors. A browser that supports cookies is required before a user can login to the site. Cookies help us keep track of the number of visitors to our site and allow us to gauge the areas that are of the most interest to our members by analyzing common paths taken through the site. This information is never linked to an individual user, and is only used to maintain an aggregate view of site traffic. We also use cookies to personalize the site and make using the site easier during each session by keeping track of user name. </p>


<p>We also gather standard logfile data such as the date, time, referrer, browser and platform used for all visits to the site. This information is analyzed monthly and is used to gain a broad picture of usage patterns at ePALS. This information is never linked to any individual user.</p>



<h3>DATA COLLECTION FROM ADULTS</h3>

<p>In addition to the information contained above, we also collect additional information from adults, and give them the opportunity to disclose additional information. For example, a teacher registering with ePALS is requested to provide their school name, as well.  In addition, we offer those who register as teachers the opportunity to create and post an online profile, with fields for name, school name, school URL (optional), grade level taught, range of ages of students, languages spoken, total number of students in that class, any additional communication capabilities (optional), school street address (optional), and city and state. </p>


<h4>e-Commerce</h4>

<p>ePALS offers links to various online stores that offer merchandise of interest to teachers and parents in our "Educational Products" section. ePALS staff have carefully chosen e-commerce partners that provide only products appropriate to educators and parents, but cannot guarantee the contents of these external sites.</p>
