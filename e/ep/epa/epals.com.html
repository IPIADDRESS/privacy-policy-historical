<p>When we use the term “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are referring to personally identifiable information. When we refer to “Child Related Personal Information,” we mean personally identifiable information of minors (i.e. persons under the age of 18). General references to “information” are to information that does not and could not reasonably be used by us to identify an individual.</p>

<h3>I. PRIVACY NOTICE FOR CHILDREN UNDER 13</h3>
<p>Cricket limits the collection of personal information from children to only that which is necessary to obtain parental consent or to participate in a Cricket program or activity after we and/or participating schools (in the case of CricketTogether™ and TryEngineering Together™) have obtained parental consent. If you are under age 13, you are not allowed to subscribe to any of the Services or create an account without the permission of your parent, guardian, or teacher. In addition to the required consent, it is a good idea to request assistance from your parent or legal guardian in setting up your account, for online Challenges, contests or other activities, if any, for which there is an account associated with use of a particular Service, or your teacher with respect to setting up your account for ePals®.</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>Parental Consent (and Teacher and Guardian Consent)</h5>
<p>We require a parent or guardian to consent before a child under the age of 13 can become a member of the ePals Global Community, as discussed below, or to use any of the Services offered by Cricket. During any such registration process, we only collect limited personal information (i.e., parent’s name and email address) for the purposes of obtaining a parent’s permission for his/her child to participate in the particular Service, including Challenges or contests, or become a member of the ePals Global Community (“ePals<sup>®</sup>”).</p>
<p>If we receive consent from a teacher (including those parent[s] involved in home schooling) or school administrator, your child’s ePals membership will be activated.</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>What Information Do We Collect From Children?</h5>
<h6>Personally Identifiable Information</h6>
<p>We may collect the following types of personal information directly from children: date of birth and parent email address in order to notify the parent and obtain consent. We may collect the following information from parents or teachers about a child: first name, last name, password, nickname, IP address, grade level, gender, mailing address and parent’s name and email address.</p>
<p>We may also passively collect, through Users’ computers, mobile phones or other wireless devices and we also collect personally identifiable information through cookies from children’s computers. In connection with activities such as contests/Challenges, we do collect and share children’s images, audio and video submitted through such contest or Challenge but only after full parental consent has been obtained. Children are able to post on forums on the ePals Global Community (or in certain instances in connection with a teacher’s activation of CricketTogether or TryEngineering Together) but such content is moderated and any personally identifiable information is removed and deleted before posting. In some instances, that is, only as between classrooms in the ePals Global Community may a teacher exchange photos/videos for use in the online projects but not otherwise publicly available. Posting or other uploading of information by users at or through <a href="http://cicadamag.com">cicadamag.com</a> is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13 and will not knowingly be collected.</p>
<h6></h6>
<h6>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h6>
<p>We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information from visitors to our site, such as the date and time of their visit, the type of browser used, the type of operating system used, the ISP from which the visitor receives Internet access, and aggregate information regarding what pages users of the site access or visit.</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>How Do We Use the Information We Collect From Children?</h5>
<h6>Use of Personally Identifiable Information:</h6>
<p>We may use the personally identifiable information that we collect from a child: (1) to determine whether he or she is eligible to use the Services; (2) to obtain consent from his or her parent, teacher or school administrator, as applicable, for the child to use the Services; (3) to provide an interactive online experience; (4) to provide customization and content recommendations; (5) to provide educational content that we believe that the child may be interested in or would benefit from; (6) to fulfill requests for products.</p>
<h6></h6>
<h6>Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</h6>
<p>We may use non-personally identifiable information (such as cookies and Web surfing habits associated with IP addresses) to improve the design, content and performance of the Services, including in the case of the CricketTogether product through surveys which results may be shared with educational consultants engaged by Cricket Media, or in the case of TryEngineering Together with IEEE and entities that may be sponsoring TryEngineering Together programs in schools. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage and the popularity of the Services (individually or collectively).</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>Will Cricket Share My Child’s Personal Information with Third Parties?</h5>
<p>We may disclose personally identifiable and/or non-personally identifiable information in certain limited circumstances, as set forth in Section III below.</p>
<p>We or teachers or administrators (in connection with Services utilized by teachers or other program administrators with authority to engage participating students such as ePals or CricketTogether or TryEngineeringTogether), moderate all user generated content to remove any personally identifiable information unless, as is the case of contests or Challenges, we have parent permission to share this publicly, including on our websites or in connection with <a href="http://cicadamag.com">cicadamag.com</a>, which is targeted for ages 13 and older. However, while we take all reasonable steps, where applicable, to ensure that children do not share their personal information no system is foolproof.</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>Can I Review, Change or Delete the Child Related Personal Information Cricket has Collected from My Child?</h5>
<p>Yes, you can. You can review the Child Related Personal Information related to your child by making a request, as described below, at any time.

<h3>II. STUDENT DIGITAL PRIVACY</h3>

As a parent, you should consult your school’s acceptable use policy for more information about your child’s school’s policies and practices for protecting children on the Internet. As a teacher or school administrator, you should confirm that you have authority to consent on behalf of your student’s parents, by reviewing your school’s acceptable use policy and any express consents provided by parents or guardians to students’ online activities, together with Cricket’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Teachers may provide consent electronically when creating accounts for their students. Parent consent is required before a student’s content or information is shared outside of the school context.</p>
<p>CricketTogether™ verifies the teacher who has created the account for the school by receiving written consent and agreement from the school principal.</p>
<p>If you are a student under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us unless (and until) you have first obtained consent from your parent, guardian or authorized teacher, and please do not send any personal information other than the limited information we request from you in connection with the Services.</p>
