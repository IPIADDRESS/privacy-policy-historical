           our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our 
          information gathering and dissemination practices for this website:
          EPage.com. EPage cares about the privacy of each user of its Web site
          ("user" or "you"),
          including those who trust us enough to place orders. In order to protect
        the privacy of its users, we have adopted the following policy: </p>
<span class="style1">General Information</span><br>
        When you use the Web site some
        basic general information is collected. This information is used to
        improve the Web site and make your use of the Web site as enjoyable
        and efficient as possible. Cookies are also used to help us determine
        the various services you use and the support you may need, and to help
      us detect and solve any problems you may have when using the Web site. 
        <p>This general information is used internally in connection with EPage's
          business, including our personal, marketing and advertising efforts. 
        </p><hr>
        <span class="style1">Collecting Information From Children Younger than 13</span><br>
  The Web site is not intended for use by those under the age of 13
            years old. We do not knowingly collect or use any Personal Information
            from children younger than 13 years of age without obtaining verifiable
        parental consent. <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <span class="style1">Information We Collect From You</span><br>
      Our site's registration process may require users to give us contact
               information (like name and email address) and unique identifiers
        (like social security number or tax identification number). The customer's
               contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary.
      We use it to complete and support your purchases from and use of
    the Web site,  to comply with any requirements of law, and to respond
    to any questions you might have. Unique identifiers (such as email addresses)
      are collected for use as account numbers in our record system. For affiliate
      relationships, social security numbers may be used to report income to
      the appropriate government authorities.        
      <p></p>
        <p>As you browse our web site, we may gather navigational and clickstream
            data that shows what pages are visited and how long various features
            are used. This information will not reveal your identity or be linked
            to you personally. We use this information to  support
            your  use of the Web site, to comply
            with any requirements of law, and to determine the commissions for
            our Affiliates.
          This data may be disclosed   to third parties
            in aggregate only with no personally identifiable information ever
        being disclosed to affiliates. </p>
  <hr>
        <span class="style1">Your Email Address and Communication With You </span>
          <br>
          We do not rent, sell, or otherwise disclose your email address to third
          parties.  We do not Spam (send advertising emails or solo ads)  our
          users. Your email address is required for many parts of our service.
          It is not required to browse the site and view ads. An email address
          is required to place a classified ad or auction, reply to an ad or
          auction, use the feedback system, sign up for a SearchAlert, or participate
          in our Affiliate program.
          <p></p>
        <p>We send a monthly email to all users. This monthly email will contain
          updates, news, and special offers, as well as information about your
          account. This email may contain advertising or offers from third parties
          and this will be indicated as such. If you do not want to receive this
          monthly email, you can opt-out from a link in the email as well as
          from your account page. </p>
        <p>We send a weekly email with the status and performance of your ads
          to all users who have active ads listed on the Web site. If you do
          not want to receive this weekly email, you can opt-out  from
          the summary area of your Members page.</p>
        <p>We send SearchAlert emails to users up to once per day to those who
          have signed up for a SearchAlert when there is a match to the search
          criteria that they create. If you do
          not want to receive this  email, you can delete your SearchAlert from
          the SearchAlert area of your Members page.</p>
        <p>We 
            send you email on a user's behalf when they reply to your ad. We
          strive to intercept unwanted replies to ads, but we take no responsibility
            for the content of any reply you get. Your contact information, including
          email address is not disclosed to browsers unless you expressly enter
          it into the ad for the public to see. We have a procedure for you to
          report unwanted replies to us as part of the email. Do not report any
          email we send you to authorities as Spam or your account priviledges
          may be terminated. </p>
        <p>We send regular account reminders to all users who have outstanding
          balances. If you do not want to recieve these notices, you can pay
          the balance due via PayPal, Credit Card, or a check or money order
          in US funds sent to our place of business. This information is available
          in the account area of your Members page. </p>
        <p>We send a weekly email to all affiliates with a short newsletter and
          statistics about their affiliate account. Affiliates can opt out of
          this email from the Affiliate Manager area.</p>
        <p>We will send email to you for other legitimate purposes as part of
          the site operation. You will get email confirmation when you register,
          place an ad, reply to an ad,  make a payment,
          use the feedback system, and for other operational reasons. </p>
        <p></p>
        <hr>
        <span class="style1">Your IP Address</span><br>
          Your IP address is transmitted to each web server every time you make 
            a request. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with 
            our server, and to administer our Web site. We do not link IP 
            addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's 
          session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.         
          <br>
          <br>
        <hr>
        <span class="style1">Our Use of Cookies</span><br>
        Cookies are very tiny text files that are stored on your computer
          when you visit certain web pages that record your preferences. They
        cannot harm your computer and they do not contain any personal or private
        information.
        <p>If you take out an ad on EPage Network Classifeds or become an affiliate
            we use temporary cookies to help format the page, and indicate what
            ads you can view. We also place permanent cookies to enable some
  of the advanced benefits, such as viewing all ads, for Gold members. In
            the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party
          advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. </p>
        <p>Most cookies expire after a certain time period. The most popular
          browsers, such as Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer, can be
        set to give you the option of accepting or rejecting all cookies. </p>
        <p>To use many of our services, your browser will need to be configured
          to accept cookies. Here's how to do it: In Netscape Navigator,
          click the Edit menu and select Preferences from the browser's drop-down
          menu. In the tree structure, click Advanced (Netscape 4) or Privacy
          &amp; Security (Netscape 7). Under Cookies, you can slect the option you
          feel most comfortable with that enables cookies. In Internet Explorer,
          click the View (older versions of Explorer) or Tools (current version)
          menu and select Internet Options from the drop-down menu. Click the
          Advanced tab, scroll to the Security heading, and select the option
          you feel most comfortable with that enables cookies.
        </p><p>If you wish, you may set your browser to reject all cookies and still
          view the site. Because our system requires cookies for many processes,
          you may find that you are unable to place an ad or perform other tasks. 
        </p><hr>
<span class="style1">Exceptional Disclosures</span><br> 
        We may disclose your information if necessary
        to protect our legal rights, if the information relates to actual or
        threatened harmful conduct, or EPage has good faith belief that such
        action is necessary to (1) conform to the requirements of law or comply
        with governmental orders, court orders, or legal process served on EPage;
        or (2) to protect and defend the property or rights of EPage, the
        users of its website or the public. This includes exchanging information
  with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
  protection. If EPage should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with
  another company, we may sell the information you provide to us on the EPage
  website to a third party or share your personal information with the company
  we merge with. <br>
  <br>
        <hr>
<span class="style1">Third Party Notice</span><br>    
    This site contains links to other sites. EPage wants you to be aware that
    when you click on links (including advertising banners), which take you to
    third-party Web sites, you will be subject to such third parties' privacy
    policies. While we support the protection of privacy on the Internet, we
    expressly disclaim any and all liability for the actions of third parties,
    including without limitation actions relating to the use and/or disclosure
    of Personal Information by third parties.
    <p align="LEFT"> EPage serves and receives ads from third party sites (our 
          affiliates). Information not displayed in the ad (and thus not available 
          to the general public via the Web) is not made available to these third 
        party participants.
        </p><p align="LEFT">EPage uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads
           when you visit our Web site. Our third-party advertising companies
          also  may separately place or recognize a cookie file on your browser
          in the  course of delivering advertisements to this Site. These
          companies  may use information (not including your name, address email
          address  or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web
          sites in  order to provide advertisements about goods and services
          of interest  to you. If you would like more information

        <span class="style1">Future Use </span><br>
   From time to time, we may use customer information for new, 
          unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If 
          our information practices change at some time in the future we will 
          post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes 
          and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you 
          are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back 
          at our Web site periodically. <br>
          <br>
        <hr>
        <span class="style1">Site Security</span><br>
  This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse 
  and alteration of the information under our control. We offer secure
  web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store certain
  kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and management
  practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data
  stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe
  the measures implemented by our web site reduce the likelihood of security
  problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. We always use
  industry-standard  encryption technologies when transferring and receiving
  consumer data  exchanged with our site.
          <br>
          <br>        
        <hr>
        <span class="style1">Credit Card Security</span><br>
        The Internet is a vast network of computers. Because the data passes
          from computer to computer, some Internet shoppers worry that unauthorized
          persons may intercept the data and gain access to credit card numbers,
          but shopping on a secure site is actually safer than handing a credit
          card to a waiter in a restaurant. Taking the steps below will lower
          the chances of interception of your credit card number:
        <ul>
          <li>Limit your online shopping to Internet merchants, such as us, with
            sites equipped with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL prevents
            unauthorized people from intercepting your data.  
	      </li><li>Use a browser  that
		      supports SSL. These browsers show a symbol in the status bar, such
	        as a key or lock, when you are on a site that uses SSL. Most banks
	        will cover the cost of fraud resulting from unauthorized use of your
	        credit card or may limit your liability.
        </li></ul>
	    <p>Credit card information collected  is encrypted through Secure Sockets
	      Layer before it is transmitted over the Internet.
        </p><p>We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those
	        who use our services for illegal activities, and may in our sole
          discretion disclose Personal Information or other information to satisfy
          any law, regulation, subpoena, or government request. We reserve the
          right to release Personal Information or other information about users
          who we believe are engaged in illegal activities or are otherwise in
          violation of our Terms of Use, even without a subpoena, warrant or
          court order, if we believe in our sole discretion that such disclosure
          is necessary or appropriate to operate the Web site, or to protect
          the rights or property of EPage, its affiliates, or any of their officers,
          directors, or employees, agents, third-party content providers, suppliers,
          sponsors, or licensors. We also reserve the right to report to law
          enforcement agencies any activities we reasonably believe in our sole
        discretion to be unlawful.
