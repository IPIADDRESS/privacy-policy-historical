                                <p>We don't use cookies to track people's Internet usage after leaving our sites and we don't store personal information in them others could read and understand. We will not sell or distribute cookie information without your prior consent.</p>

                                <h3>Collecting information</h3>
                                <p>Cookies are harmless text files that web servers can store on your computer's
                                    hard drive when you visit a site. They allow the server to recognise you when
                                    you revisit.</p>

                                <h3>There are two main types:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Transient (or per-session) cookies</strong> – these only exist for your
                                    site visit and are deleted on exit. They recognise you as you move between
                                    pages, for example, recording items added to an online shopping basket. These
                                    cookies also help maintain security.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Persistent (or permanent) cookies</strong> – these stay on your machine
                                    until expiry or deletion. Many are built with automatic deletion dates to help
                                    ensure your hard drive doesn't get overloaded. These cookies often store and
                                    re-enter your log-in information, so you don't need to remember membership
                                    details.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>We use both types of cookies.</p>
                                <p>Additionally, cookies can be first or third party cookies. First party cookies
                                    are owned &amp; created by the website you're viewing. Third party cookies are
                                    owned &amp; created by an independent company, usually a company providing a
                                    service to the website owners.</p>
