</p>

<p>
  3. <strong>PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING CHILDREN</strong>
</p>

<p>
  With the exception of the AppsforKids products and services which are
  subject to a separate privacy policy, 3DS products and services are not
  designed to be marketed to children who are considered as minor under the
  applicable data protection law and 3DS does not knowingly collect or store
  Personal Data from children under such age. For children whose usual place
  of residence is in the European Union, Lichtenstein, Norway or Iceland, the
  default age at which a person is no longer considered a child is 16 subject
  to local law to adjust that limit between 13 and 16.
</p>
<p>
  Certain 3DS products and services may be appropriate for use by children,
  however, in which case children below the age of consent under local data
  protection laws must seek consent from their parents or guardians prior to
  creating a 3DS account or registering a product. Teachers and school
  administrators may act in the place of parents and guardians and provide
  consent for the collection of Personal Data from children (schools should
  always ensure that they have received permission from parents or guardians
  to do so).
</p>
<p>
  If parents or guardians become aware that their child has provided 3DS with
  Personal Data without their consent or without a teacher’s or school
  administrator’s consent, they can ask 3DS to remove such Personal Data and
  terminate the child’s account by using <a href="/search/web/contact/">this contact form</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If 3DS becomes aware that it has collected Personal Data from a child below
  the age of consent under local data protection laws without consent from a
  parent or guardian, 3DS will take steps to seek the parent’s or guardian’s
  consent for that processing or to remove such Personal Data and terminate
  the child’s account.
</p>
<p>
