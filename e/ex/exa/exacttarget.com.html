      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

      <div class="content">
        <h4>Privacy at ExactTarget</h4>

        <p>ExactTarget is committed to protecting the  privacy of our web site visitors and clients. We uphold the highest industry  standards in online privacy and permission marketing. For more information on  how ExactTarget enforces permission email marketing with our clients, please  see our <a href="company-anti-spam-policy.asp">Anti-spam policy</a>.</p>

        <h4>Security and Privacy</h4>

        <p>ExactTarget's web site uses security measures to  protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our  control. We store the information in a database in a secure environment at our  data center</p>

        <p>We will never share, sell, or rent individual  personal information with anyone without your advance permission or unless  ordered by a court of law. Information submitted to us is only available to  employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you or sending  you e-mails based on your requesting information</p>

        <h4>Choice Opt-in</h4>

        <p>Our members and their subscribers are given the opportunity to 'opt-in' to  having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at  the point where we ask for the information.</p>

        <p>Users of our site will always be notified if their information is being  collected by any outside parties. We do this to ensure that our users can make  an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that  require an outside party.</p>

        <h4>Information Tracked</h4>

        <p>At times we will use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our  server and to administer our web site. We also may track browser types to help  us understand our visitors' needs related to our web site design.</p>

        <p>There is an optional section of our web site where input forms require your  name, company, and e-mail address. This form provides the ability to opt-in to  receiving future emails of any sort from ExactTarget. If you opt-in to  receiving email communications from us, then we may send information to you on  our products or services.</p>

        <p>You may review and change your information with us at any time by clicking  on the "modify profile" link or similar found at the bottom of emails  sent via our system, or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@exacttarget.com">privacy@exacttarget.com</a></p>

        <h4>Web Beacons</h4>

        <p>In order to  determine a user’s ability to receive HTML email in addition to whether or not  an email has been opened, ExactTarget includes a “web beacon” in a majority of  the HTML email messages we send. A web beacon (actually a small .gif image) is  activated when an HTML email is opened via a request for the image on our  servers. </p>
        <p>This capability  helps ExactTarget send email in a format users can read and enables  ExactTarget, and our clients that use the functionality, to track the aggregate  number of emails opened. The web beacon does not collect any personally  identifiable information. Users that do not want to receive email messages with  web beacons can choose to receive their emails in text (non-HTML) format.</p>
        <p>We also use, and  provide our clients with, the capability to track when a URL has been clicked  inside of an email message sent by our system. We use this functionality to  track which links were clicked and in what quantity, as well as the aggregate  number of links clicked. This click tracking functionality does not collect any  personally identifiable information.</p>
        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>Client-side cookies are used to verify the login status of customers using  products or services linked directly with our website. Usage of a cookie is in  no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. If  a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site; however, the user may  not be able to access all areas of our site.</p>

        <h4>Links to other Websites</h4>

        <p>ExactTarget is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of  any other web sites to which we link.</p>

        <h4>Notification of Changes</h4>

        <p>ExactTarget will notify its members and users via email if we make any  changes to our privacy policy. Any new policy will be posted on our site at  least one week prior to its taking effect. If at any point we decide to use  personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at  the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will  have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different  manner.<br>
          <br>
Privacy Policy Effective Date: June 15, 2006<br>

        <h4>Safe Harbor Data Privacy Notice</h4>

        <p>ExactTarget, Inc. ("ExactTarget") adheres to the Safe Harbor  Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the "Safe Harbor  Principles") with respect to personal information (as defined below) it  receives from the European Union.<br>
This notice outlines our general policy and practices for implementing the  Safe Harbor Principles, including the type of information to which this notice  applies, how we use personal information, and the choices individuals have  regarding our use of, and their ability to correct, that personal information.  If there is any conflict between the policies in this notice and the Safe  Harbor Principles, the Safe Harbor Principles will govern.<br>
This notice applies to all personal information we handle, including on-line  (except as noted below), off-line, and manually processed data. For purposes of  this notice, "personal information" means data that:</p>

        <ul type="disc">
          <li>is transferred from the       European Union to the United         States; </li>
          <li>is recorded in any form; and </li>
          <li>is about, or pertains to, a specific       individual who is identified in, or is identifiable from, the data. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Sensitive information" is a subcategory of personal information.  Sensitive information is defined as personal information specifying medical or  health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or  philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or the sex life of the  individual. Sensitive information also includes personal information received  from a third party where the third party treats and identifies it as sensitive.</p>
        <h4>Safe Harbor Principles Regarding Personal Information</h4>

        <p><strong>Notice and Choice</strong></p>

        <p>We notify individuals about the personal information we collect from them,  how we use it, and how to contact us with privacy concerns. We obtain personal  information only as permitted by the Safe Harbor Principles or with the consent  of the individual affected. Consent for personal information to be collected,  used, and/or disclosed in certain ways may be required in order for an  individual to obtain or use our services. To the extent permitted under the Safe Harbor,  we reserve the right to process personal information in the course of providing  professional services to our clients without the knowledge of individuals  involved.</p>

        <p><strong>Disclosures and Transfers</strong></p>

        <p>We do not disclose personal information to third parties, except when one or  more of the following conditions is true:</p>

        <ul type="disc">
          <li>We have the individual's       permission to make the disclosure; </li>
          <li>The disclosure is permitted       by law or mandatory professional standards; </li>
          <li>The disclosure is reasonably       related to the sale or other disposition of all or part of our business or       assets; </li>
          <li>The personal information to       be disclosed is publicly available; </li>
          <li>The party to whom the       disclosure is made controls, is controlled by, or is under common control       with ExactTarget; </li>
          <li>The disclosure is reasonably       necessary for the establishment or maintenance of legal claims; or </li>
          <li>The disclosure is to persons       or entities for whom we are providing services, provided the disclosure is       consistent with the purpose for which the personal information was       obtained. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will comply with the Safe Harbor Principles with respect to disclosures  of sensitive information, including, when applicable, obtaining the explicit  consent of the individual prior to disclosing sensitive information to a third  party or using sensitive information for purposes other than those for which it  was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.  Transfers of information permitted under this notice, either to third parties  or within ExactTarget, include the transfer of data from one jurisdiction to  another, such as transfers to and from the United States of America.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Security, Integrity, and Access</strong></p>

        <p>We employ physical, electronic, and managerial measures, including education  and training of our personnel, designed to provide the personal information in  our possession with reasonable protection from accidental loss or destruction,  improper use, alteration, or disclosure. Personal information collected or  displayed through a Web site is protected in transit by industry standard  encryption processes. However, we cannot guarantee the security of personal  information accessible on or transmitted via the Internet.<br>
          <br>
We process personal information in ways compatible with the purpose for  which the personal information was collected, or as otherwise authorized by the  individual. To the extent necessary for such purposes, we take reasonable steps  to make sure that personal information is accurate, complete, current, and  otherwise reliable with regard to its intended use.<br>
<br>
If an individual becomes aware that personal information we maintain about  that individual is inaccurate, or if an individual would like to update or  review his or her personal information, the individual may contact us using the  contact information below. As a security precaution, we may request that the  individual provide identifying information such as name, address, birth date,  and/or social security number. In addition, we may limit or deny access to  personal information where providing such access would be unreasonably  burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the  Safe Harbor Agreement. In some circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee,  where warranted, for access to personal information.</p>

        <p><strong>Accountability and Enforcement</strong></p>

        <p>We established a program to monitor our adherence to the Safe Harbor  Principles and to address questions and concerns regarding our adherence. This  program will include a statement, at least once a year, signed by our  authorized representative, verifying our adherence to the Safe Harbor  Principles. We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns with us using  the contact information below.<br>
          <br>
With respect to any dispute relating to this notice that cannot be resolved  through our internal processes, we will cooperate with competent European Union  data protection authorities and comply with the advice of such authorities. In  the event that we or such authorities determine that we did not comply with  this notice, we will take appropriate steps to address any adverse effects and  to promote future compliance.</p>

        <p><strong>Amendment</strong></p>

        <p>We may amend this notice from time to time by posting a revised notice on  this Web site, or a similar Web site that replaces this Web site. If we amend  the notice, the new notice will apply to personal information previously  collected only insofar as the rights of the individual affected are not  reduced. So long as we profess to adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles, we will  not amend this notice in a manner inconsistent with the Safe Harbor Principles.</p>

        <p><strong>Information Subject to Other Policies</strong></p>

        <p>We are committed to following the Safe Harbor Principles for all personal  information, as that term is defined herein. Other information we receive may  be subject to policies that may differ in some respects from the policies set  forth in this notice. Certain of our Web sites have their own privacy policies  that apply specifically to those Web sites. Those policies may be accessed  through the Web sites in question. Information relating to present or former  ExactTarget personnel is subject to our policies concerning personnel data  privacy, which are available to present and former ExactTarget personnel upon  request. Information obtained from or relating to clients or former clients is  further subject to the terms of any privacy commitment made to the client, any  agreements with the client, and/or any applicable laws and professional  standards.</p>
