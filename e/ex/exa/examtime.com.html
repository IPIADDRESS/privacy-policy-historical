and any other documents referred to on it)
sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from
you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.
</p>
<p>
"Personal Data" is information relating to a living individual
who can be identified from the information and it includes your
name, email address or postal address.
</p>
<p>
"Processing" includes when we obtain data from you, store your
data, transfer your data or use your data to allow you to use
this site. Please read the following carefully to understand our
views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will
treat it.
</p>
<p>
For the purpose of the Data Protection Act, 1988 (as amended)
(the Act), the data controller is Examtime Limited of First
Floor, 8/9 Hanover Street East, Dublin 2.
</p>
<p>
Our nominated representative for the purpose of the Act is Peter
Buckley who can be contacted at the address above.
</p>
<h2>
INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU
</h2>
<p>
We may collect and process the following data about you:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Information that you provide by filling in forms on our site
www.examtime.com (our site). This includes information provided
at the time of registering to use our site, subscribing to our
service, posting material or requesting further services. We may
also ask you for information when you enter a competition or
promotion sponsored by Examtime Limited, and when you report a
problem with our site.
</li>
<li>
If you contact us, we may keep a record of that
correspondence.
</li>
<li>
We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for
research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.

<h2>
INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT
</h2>
<p>
We may collect information about your computer, including where
available your IP address, operating system of your computer and
browser type of your computer, for our system administration and
to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is
statistical data about our users' browsing actions (i.e. use of
our website) and patterns, and does not identify you or any
individual.
</p>
<h2>
COOKIES
</h2>
<p>
Our website uses "Cookies" to distinguish you from other users of
our website. A Cookie is a small text file implanted by us and
most other website operators (or an advertiser on this site) on
the hard disk of your computer when you visit the site. Cookies
can collect information about users of our site like you, such as
your names, address, e-mail details, passwords and your user
preferences. While cookies and the information they obtain may
not identify a living individual on their own, they may be able
to do so in combination with other information held by us or a
third party. This helps us to provide you with a good experience
when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our
site. The types of cookies used are highlighted on browsing to
our website for the first time. The website uses session cookies
for site navigation purposes. These cookies expire and are
deleted at the end of a browsing session. We also use Google
Analytics for tracking purposes.
</p>
<h2>
WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
</h2>
<p>
The data that we collect from you will not be transferred to, and
stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area which
consists of the European Union, Norway and Iceland ("EEA"). It
will only be processed by staff operating in the EEA who work for
us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in,
among other things, processing your subscription, the processing
of your payment details and the provision of support services. By
submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer,
storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably
necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in
accordance with this privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure
servers. A server is a machine that amongst others stores and
processes data or information. Any payment transactions will be
encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where
you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain
parts of our site or your account, you are responsible for
keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your
password with anyone.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the transmission of or sending by you of
information via the internet is not completely secure. Although
we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot
guarantee the security of your data transmitted or sent by you to
our site; any transmission or sending by you is at your own risk.
Once we have received your information, we will use strict
procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised
access
<em>i.e.</em>
access to your data by a person who should
not have such access.
</p>
<h2>
USES MADE OF THE INFORMATION
</h2>
<p>
We use information held about you in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
To ensure that content from our site is presented in the most

</li>
<li>
To provide you with information, products or services that
you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you
have consented to be contacted for such purposes.
</li>
<li>
To carry out our obligations or duties arising from any
contracts or subscriptions entered into between you and us.
</li>
<li>
To allow you to participate in interactive features of our
service, when you choose to do so.

<p>
We may also use your data, or permit selected third parties to
use your data, to provide you with information about goods and
services which may be of interest to you and we or they may
contact you about these by email, post or telephone.
</p>
<p>
We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to
our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate
information about our users (for example, we may inform them that
500 users in the United Kingdom have clicked on their
advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate
information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they
want to target (for example, users in London). We may make use of
the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to
comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their
advertisement to that target audience.
</p>
<h2>

which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective
seller or buyer of such business or assets, although that

</li>
<li>
If Examtime Limited or substantially all of its assets are
acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it
about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.
</li>
<li>
If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal

<p>

deleted from the site and also request us to cease obtaining
further personal data from the child going forward. To do so if
you are the parent or guardian of a child either post or send by
fax to us an affidavit, along with a copy of your driver’s
license or passport, to the address or fax number below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>

oaths. Your affidavit must confirm:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You are the parent or guardian;
</li>
<li>
Your child is under the age of eighteen years;
</li>
<li>
Whether you would like to have the right to review the

instructions. If you are submitting an affidavit in relation to a
child under 13 years of age, then please do not include any of
their personal data. If you do include any personal data of the
child, your request is your instruction for us to receive and
store the personal data as reasonably necessary to fulfil your
request.
</p>
