        To provide website visitors with more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics, Google have developed the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
        The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to indicate that information about the website visit should not be sent to Google Analytics.
        The Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to the website itself or to other web analytics services.<br>
