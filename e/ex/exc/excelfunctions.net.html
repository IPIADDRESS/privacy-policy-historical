					Privacy Policy
				</p>
				
				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				
				We recognize that your privacy is important. This document
				outlines the types of personal information we receive and
				collect when you use ExcelFunctions.net, as well as some
				of the steps we take to safeguard information. We hope this
				will help you make an informed decision about sharing
				personal information with us.
				
				<br><br>
				
				ExcelFunctions.net strives to maintain the highest
				standards of decency, fairness and integrity in all our
				operations. Likewise, we are dedicated to protecting our
				customers', consumers' and online visitors' privacy on our
				website.
				
				<br><br>
				
				<b>Personal Information</b>
				
				<br><br>
				
				ExcelFunctions.net collects personally identifiable
				information from the visitors to our website only on a
				voluntary basis. Personal information collected on a
				voluntary basis may include name, postal address, email
				address, company name and telephone number.
				
				<br><br>
				
				This information is collected if you request information
				from us, participate in a contest or sweepstakes, and sign
				up to join our email list or request some other service or
				information from us. The information collected is internally
				reviewed, used to improve the content of our website, notify
				our visitors of updates, and respond to visitor inquiries.
				
				<br><br>
				
				Once information is reviewed, it is discarded or stored in
				our files. If we make material changes in the collection of
				personally identifiable information we will inform you by
				placing a notice on our site. Personal information received
				from any visitor will be used only for internal purposes and
				will not be sold or provided to third parties.
				
				<br><br>
				
				<b>Use of Cookies and Web Beacons</b>
				
				<br><br>
				
				We may use cookies to help you personalize your online
				experience. Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to
				your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to
				enable our systems to recognize your browser. The purpose of
				a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to
				a specific page. For example, if you personalize the sites
				pages, or register with any of our site's services, a cookie
				enables (website/company name) to recall your specific
				information on subsequent visits.
				
				<br><br>
				
				You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by
				modifying your Web browser; however, if you choose to
				decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the
				interactive features of the site.
				
				<br><br>
				
				A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor
				your journey around a single website or collection of sites.
				They are also referred to as web bugs and are commonly used
				by sites that hire third-party services to monitor traffic.
				They may be used in association with cookies to understand
				how visitors interact with the pages and content on the
				pages of a web site.
				
				<br><br>
				
				We may serve third party advertisements that use cookies and
				web beacons in the course of ads being served on our web
				site to ascertain how many times you've seen an
				advertisement. No personally identifiable information you
				give us is provided to them for cookie or web beacon use, so
				they cannot personally identify you with that information on
				our web site.
				
				<br><br>
				
				Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify
				you when a cookie is being sent. Privacy software can be
				used to override web beacons. Taking either of these actions
				shouldn't cause a problem with our site, should you so
				choose.
				
				<br><br>
				
				<b>Non-Personal Information</b>
				
				<br><br>
				
				In some cases, we may collect information about you that is
				not personally identifiable. We use this information, which
				does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to
				administer the site, to track users' movements around the
				site and to gather demographic information about our user
				base as a whole.  The information collected is used solely
				for internal review and not shared with other organizations
				for commercial purposes.
				
				<br><br>
				
				We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website.
				These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email
				address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites
				in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
				If you would like more information about this practice and would like to know
				your options in relation to not having this information used by these companies,
				<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/privacy_ads.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">click here</a>.
				
				<br><br>
				
				<b>Release of Information</b>
				
				<br><br>
				
				If ExcelFunctions.net is sold, the information we have
				obtained from you through your voluntary participation in
				our site may transfer to the new owner as a part of the sale
				in order that the service being provided to you may
				continue. In that event, you will receive notice through our
				website of that change in control and practices, and we will
				make reasonable efforts to ensure that the purchaser honors
				any opt-out requests you might make of us.
				
				<br><br>
				
				<b>How You Can Correct or Remove Information</b>
				
				<br><br>
				
				We provide this privacy policy as a statement to you of our
				commitment to protect your personal information. If you have
				submitted personal information through our website and would
				like that information deleted from our records or would like
				to update or correct that information, please use our Contact Us page.
				
				<br><br>
				
				<b>Updates and Effective Date</b>
				
				<br><br>
				
				ExcelFunctions.net reserves the right to make changes in
				this policy. If there is a material change in our privacy
				practices, we will indicate on our site that our privacy
				practices have changed and provide a link to the new privacy
				policy. We encourage you to periodically review this policy
				so that you will know what information we collect and how we
				use it.
				
				<br><br>
