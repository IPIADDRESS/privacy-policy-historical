google adsense, affiliate links etc. The width is set to 20%, alter this as you wish.
DONT go below 10% or it will be too narrow to fit anything in. Between 15% and 25% should suit

<!-- the code below if for the left side column.(the navigation column) Why is it at the end, rather than at the start,
where you might expect it to be? Because of the way SE spiders read tables. They start top left,
and work across each cell in order, to the bottom right.
If we have this cell where you would expect, then the spiders would read your navigation etc
BEFORE they read your content. We dont want that. Thats why we have a spacer cell at the top.
Although this appears to the eye to be the far left column, its actually down the order of cells.-->
