				<p> Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your 
		experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use 
		the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence.
		<br>
		<br>
		We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and 
		security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects information from all end 
		users of our Internet services (the "Services"), including those who access some of our 
		Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors") and those who may purchase Products and/or 
		pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members"). This Policy also explains 
		what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have 
		concerning the collection and use of such information. We request that you read this Privacy 
		Policy carefully. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used</b><br>
		<br>
		<b>Introduction</b> <br>
		<br>
		Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our 
		Products or Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as 
		a credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. 
		The personal information collected from Members during the registration process (or at any 
		other time) is used primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Products and 
		Services. Your information will never be licensed or sold to any third party. However, we 
		may make limited disclosure of personal information under the specific circumstances 
		described in the "Disclosure" section below. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Disclosure</b> <br>
		<br>
		We may disclose Member and Visitor information to the following third parties, under the 
		following circumstances:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Companies who work on our behalf:</b> We contract with other companies to perform 
			business support functions on our behalf, which may involve limited access to your 
			personal information. We require these companies to use the information only to provide 
			the contracted services; they are prohibited from transferring the information to 
			another party except as needed to provide those services. Some examples of these 
			business support functions include order fulfillment, coupon fulfillment, award and 
			rebate fulfillments, customer survey execution and information systems management. We 
			also may make aggregate non-personal information available to select service providers.<br>
			</li>
			<li><b>Subsidiaries and joint ventures:</b> A subsidiary or a joint venture is an 
			organization in which we own at least a 50% interest. If our <i>Company</i> shares your 
			information with a subsidiary or joint venture partner, our <i>Company</i> will require 
			that they not transfer your information to another party for marketing purposes or use 
			your information contrary to your expressed choices. If you have indicated that you do 
			not want to receive any marketing information from our <i>Company</i>, we will not share 
			your information with our subsidiary or joint venture partner for their marketing 
			purposes.<br>
			</li>
			<li><b>Co-branded and Partner Pages:</b> Our <i>Company</i> may share information with 
			partner companies who jointly present special offers or promotions on co-branded pages 
			within our site. You will be notified of this sharing when you are asked to furnish 
			personal data on such a page. The partner's use of any information you submit will be 
			governed by the partner's own privacy notice, which you can review before submitting 
			your information. <br>
			</li>
			<li><b>Business Transfers:</b> Our <i>Company</i> reserves the right to transfer your 
			personal information in connection with the sale or transfer of all or a portion of our 
			business or assets. If the business is sold or transferred, our <i>Company</i> will give 
			you an opportunity to tell us not to transfer your personal information. In some cases, 
			this may mean that the new organization will not be able to continue providing to you 
			the services or products that our <i>Company</i> provided. <br>
			</li>
			<li><b>Law Enforcement:</b> Our <i>Company</i> may disclose personal information to 
			third parties without your consent for any of the following reasons: to comply with any 
			law, regulation or court order, to cooperate with Government investigations, to help 
			prevent fraud or to enforce or protect the rights of our <i>Company</i> or its 
			subsidiaries. <br>
			With Your Consent: In all other cases, our <i>Company</i> will obtain your express 
			consent before sharing your information with third parties. For example, our <i>Company</i> 
			may conduct a joint offer or contest with a third party and you will be asked whether 
			your personal information should be shared with that third party.</li>
		</ul>
		<p> <b>Online Shopping <br>
		</b><br>
		If you order services or products directly from our <i>Company</i> we will use the personal 
		information you provide only to process that order. We do not share this information with 
		outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. <br>
		<br>
		If you complete an order for some other company(ies) that may be linked to our Site, such as 
		an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information 
		about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone number. Our company 
		has no control over the third parties' use of any personal information you provide when 
		placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so. We recommend that you familiarize 
		yourself with the Privacy and Terms of Use policies of any other company(ies) whose web 
		sites you may access from our site.
		</p>
		<p> <b>Online Advertisements </b>
		</p>
		<p> Our company may display our online advertisements. In those cases we share aggregated 
		and non-identifying information about our Visitors and Members collected through the 
		registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these 
		advertisers. <br>
		<br>
		Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying information to 
		deliver tailored advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint 
		venture company tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement 
		tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have 
		collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to the intended audience. Our 
		company does not share personal information about its Visitors or Members with these 
		advertisers or joint venture companies. Information about how to opt-out of online 
		advertisements you may receive from our <i>Company</i> will be contained in the ads 
		themselves.
		</p>
		<p> <b>Responses to Email Inquiries <br>
		</b><br>
		When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to our company, the return email address is 
		used to answer the email inquiry we receive. Our company does not use the return email 
		address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third 
		party. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Voluntary Customer Surveys</b> <br>
		<br>
		We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our 
		customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information 
		that helps us to improve the types of products and services we offer and how we provide them 
		to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if 
		the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is 
		voluntary. Information about how to opt-out of surveys will be contained in survey 
		communications. <br>
		<br>
		We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our customer surveys 
		and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may have, to create 
		broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, 
		education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the 
		aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new 
		services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared 
		with third parties.
		</p>
		<p> <b>Automatic Collection of Information</b></p>
		<p> Cookies: Our <i>Company</i> may use "âCookies" to collect information. Cookies are small 
		pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive, at a web site's 
		request. Our <i>Company</i> Cookies do not contain any personal information, but are used 
		primarily as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>to keep track of temporary information. For example, Cookies allow us to keep track 
			of the pictures you upload and download;</li>
			<li>to register you in special programs. Cookies allow us to remember you when you login 
			to the places on our site that require Membership; </li>
			<li>to remember your country and language preferences;</li>
			<li>to help us understand the size of our audience and traffic patterns;</li>
			<li>to collect and record information about what you viewed on our Web site and what you 
			viewed in our e-mail; </li>
			<li>to manage and present site information and the pictures displayed on your computer, 
			and </li>
			<li>to deliver information specific to your interests.</li>
		</ul>
		<p> <b>Web Beacons:</b> We may also place small "tracker gifs" or "beacons" on many of the 
		pages on our website, in online advertising with third parties, and in our email. We use 
		these beacons, in connection with Cookies, to collect non-personal data on the usage of our 
		site including but not limited to the date and time of the visit, the pages visited, the 
		referring web page, the type of browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, NetScape), the type of 
		operating system (e.g., Windows, Linux, or Mac), and the domain name of the visitor's 
		Internet service provider (e.g., AOL). This information is collected about thousands of site 
		visits and analyzed as a whole. This information is useful in, for example, tracking the 
		performance of our online advertising such as online banner ads and to determine where to 
		place future advertising on other web sites. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Disabling Cookies and Beacons:</b> If you are uncomfortable with the collection of such 
		information through the use of Cookies and Beacons, we recommend disabling these features 
		through your browser preferences, though please understand this will limit the performance 
		and functionality of our <i>Company</i>'s Web site. Your browser documentation should 
		provide specific procedures for disabling cookie and beacon support. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Child Privacy</b> <br>
		<br>
		Protecting the online privacy of children is especially important, and those under the age 
		of 13 are protected by federal law. For that reason, our <i>Company</i> does not knowingly 
		permit children under the age of 13 to become registered members of our sites, or to buy 
		goods and services on our sites, without verifiable parental consent. Our <i>Company</i> 
		does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 13, except 
		with their parent's express consent. <br>
		<br>
		If we ever include children under the age of 13 as part of our intended site audience, those 
		specific web pages will, in accordance with the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy 
		Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice; and we 
		will provide processes to obtain parental approval, provide access to information and allow 
		parents to request removal of their children's personal information. <br>
		<br>
		Our <i>Company</i> encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online 
		and to participate in their interactive activities and interests. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Public Forums</b><br>
		<br>
		Some parts of our site may enable you to participate in public services such as discussion 
		boards, chats, and live events. Please use discretion when posting personal information 
		about yourself when using these services. Be aware that when you disclose personal 
		information at these sites, such as your name, member name, email address, etc., the 
		information may be collected and used by others to send unsolicited email. The services are 
		open to the public, and what you post there can be seen by anyone and is not protected. We 
		cannot control the comments that you may receive while you participate in these services. 
		You may find other people's comments to be offensive, harmful or inaccurate. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Our Company's Commitment to Data Security</b><br>
		<br>
		We implement a variety of administrative, managerial, and technical security measures to 
		help protect your personal information. Our <i>Company</i> has various internal control 
		standards which relate specifically to the handling of personal information. These include 
		certain controls to help safeguard the information we collect online. Our employees are 
		trained to understand and comply with these controls and we communicate our Privacy Notice, 
		practices and guidelines to our employees. However, while we strive to protect your personal 
		information, you must also take steps to protect your information. We urge you to take every 
		precaution to protect your personal information while you are on the Internet. <br>
		<br>
		Services and Web sites we sponsor have security measures in place to protect the loss, 
		misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While we make every effort to 
		ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our 
		security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this 
		information. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Where to Direct Questions About Our Privacy Policy</b><br>
		<br>
		If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the practices described herein, you 
		may contact us through the contact information provided on this Web site. Revisions to This 
		Policy Our <i>Company</i> reserves the right to revise, amend, or modify this policy, our 
		Terms Of Use &amp; Service agreement, and our other policies and agreements at any time and in
