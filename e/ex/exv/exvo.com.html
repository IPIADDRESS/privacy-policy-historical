  <p>We gather information about your usage of, and interaction with the Tolq.com software products/services and websites including computer and connection information, device capability, bandwidth, traffic to and from our website and statistics on page views.</p>
  <p>In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized Tolq.com experience, information collected through one of our products/services may be combined with other information obtained through other products/services you are using through Tolq.com.</p>
  <h1>4. How we may use your personal information?</h1>

Tolq.com does collect and uses personal data related to you. This information we collect allows us to keep you informed about our latest products, services, news and so on.</p>
  <p>By accessing Tolq.com and using a Tolq Account you agree to our mandatory service communications such as sending you, from time to time, emails about information/technical service issues, any kind of important (technical) notices, billing reminders, security announcement, conditions, policies and more. Because of the high importance of this information, it's not possible to opt-out of receiving this kind of communications.</p>

  <h1>5. Your ‘Tolq Account’ and related information</h1>
  <p>The Tolq.com website, as well as Tolq.com services allows you to create an Tolq Account based on your personal information. This convenient service saves you time and allows for easier use of our web services.</p>
  <p>This is how it works: You create a personal account; providing your email address, and in some cases your name, phone number, mailing address and/or a credit card number; and choose a password. The system saves your information and assigns you a personal Tolq Account; in many cases simply your email address, because it's unique and easy to remember.</p>
  <p>The next time you purchase a new product or service from Tolq.com, all you need to do is enter your Tolq Account and password; the system looks up the information it needs to assist you. In addition, if you update the information associated with your Tolq Account it will be available for all your transactions with Tolq.com globally.</p>
  <p>Tolq.com also enables you to forward information to family members, friends or colleagues. To fulfill your request, Tolq.com may require personal information about the person to whom you are sending the product or service such as their name, physical address, email address, and so on. The personal information you provide about that person is used only for the purpose for which it is collected. Tolq.com will not use the information collected to market directly to that person.</p>
  <h1>6. Disclosure of your personal information to third parties</h1>
  <p>As mentioned before Tolq.com takes your privacy very seriously.

If necessary we also share your personal information and traffic data to companies where we have a strategic relationship with or that perform work for Tolq.com, in order to provide the best products/services to you on our behalf.

Tolq.com will always require these third parties tot take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal information and (traffic) data and to observe the relevant legislation. Tolq.com cannot be held responsible in any way for the policies within the company of those third parties.</p>
  <p>Tolq.com may offer products/services in connecting with other websites or services of (strategic) partners, or may team with any kind of other online services to deliver you the combined results of both products/services or any other additional benefits. In order to provide that kind of service we are entitled to share your personal information and/or (traffic) data.</p>
  <p>Without such information as mentioned above being made available, it would be difficult for you to purchase products, have products/services delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us feedback to improve our products and services, or access certain services, offers, and content on the Tolq.com website.</p>
  <p>At times we may be required by law, legal process, litigation and/or requests from public and governmental authorities throughout the world, to disclose your personal information.
