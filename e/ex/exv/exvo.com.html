      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>How we may use your personal information</strong>?</p>
        <p>As mentioned before we primary collect your personal information to provide you a superior level of user experience when using our products/services. Exvo.com does collect and uses personal data related to you. This information we collect allows us to keep you informed about our latest products, news and so on.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>By accessing Exvo.com and using a Exvo Account you agree to our mandatory service communications such as sending you, from time tot time, emails about information/technical service issues, any kind of important (technical) notices, billing reminders, security announcement, conditions, policies and more. Because of the high importance of this information, itâ€™s not possible to opt-out of receiving this kind of communications</li>
          <li>By accessing Exvo.com and using a Exvo Account you allow us to send you promotional mailings about for example our latest product announcements, advertisements, marketing or promotional operations/offers, upcoming events, product surveys and more. If you donâ€™t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by changing your settings in your Exvo Account.</li>
          <li>We also collect information for market research purposes to gain a better understanding of our customers and thus provide more valuable service.</li>
          <li>Your personal information may in certain situations be used to protect your and Exvo.comâ€™s interest, in particular to enforce our Terms &amp; Conditions and to protect you against fraud.</li>
          <li>We may use personal information to provide products/services that you have requested as well as for auditing, research, and analysis to improve Exvo.comâ€™s products.</li>
          <li>Your personal information collected by using Exvo.com products/services, may be stored and processed in any country in the world where Exvo.com or other service providers, related in any way to Exvo.com maintain facilities.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Your â€˜Exvo Accountâ€™ and related information</strong></p>
        <p>The Exvo.com website, as well as Exvo.com services such as the Exvo Store, allows you to create an Exvo Account based on your personal information. This convenient service saves you time and allows for easier use of our web services.</p>
        <p>This is how it works: You create a personal profile â€” providing your email address, and in some cases your name, phone number, mailing address and/or a credit card number â€” and choose a password. The system saves your information and assigns you a personal Exvo Account â€” in many cases simply your email address, because itâ€™s unique and easy to remember.</p>
        <p>The next time you order from the Exvo Store or register for a new product, all you need to do is enter your Exvo Account and password; the system looks up the information it needs to assist you. In addition, if you update the information associated with your Exvo Account it will be available for all your transactions with Exvo.com globally.</p>
        <p>Exvo.com also enables you to forward information to family members, friends or colleagues. To fulfill your request, Exvo.com may require personal information about the person to whom you are sending the product or service such as their name, physical address, email address, and so on. The personal information you provide about that person is used only for the purpose for which it is collected. Exvo.com will not use the information collected to market directly to that person.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Disclosure of your personal information to third parties</strong></p>
        <p>As mentioned before Exvo.com takes your privacy very seriously. Exvo.com does not sell, rent, trade or otherwise transfer any personal information and/or traffic data to other marketers or any kind of third non-related parties without your explicit permission, except to the scenarios described below:</p>
        <p>From time to time itâ€™s possible that we share your personal information and (traffic) data, if necessary, with other legal entities within the Exvo.com group to help us provide superior products/services. All those entities are committed to this Privacy Policy and will take steps to safeguard it. If necessary we also share your personal information and traffic data to companies where we have a strategic relationship with or that perform work for Exvo.com, in order to provide the best products/services to you on our behalf. These companies may help us process information, extend credit, fulfill customer orders, deliver products to you, manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess your interest in our products and services, or conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys. Exvo.com will always require these third parties tot take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal information and (traffic) data and to observe the relevant legislation. Exvo.com cannot be held responsible in any way for the policies within the company of those third parties.</p>
        <p>Exvo.com may offer products/services in connecting with other websites or services of (strategic) partners, or may team with any kind of other online services to deliver you the combined results of both products/services or any other additional benefits. In order to provide that kind of service we are entitled to share your personal information and/or (traffic) data.</p>
        <p>Without such information as mentioned above being made available, it would be difficult for you to purchase products, have products/services delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us feedback to improve our products and services, or access certain services, offers, and content on the Exvo.com website.</p>
        <p>At times we may be required by law, legal process, litigation and/or requests from public and governmental authorities throughout the world, to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, fraudulent activities or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary. Exvo.com will provide all reasonable assistance and information to fulfill this request and you hereby consent to such disclosure.</p>
        <p>Exvo.com may disclose personal information and/or any data to enforce our policies, protect anyoneâ€™s rights, property and/or safety and to protect Exvo.comâ€™s interests. Your information may be stored and processed in any country in which Exvo.com, its group companies and/or other service providers maintain facilities. Exvo.com reserves the right to transfer any kind of data outside your country. By using Exvo.comâ€™s websites or Exvo.comâ€™s services/products you give us permission to any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>
        <p>We also may transfer personal information and/or data if we determine that itâ€™s necessary and reasonable to enforce our Terms &amp; Conditions, or protect our products/services, our operations and/or users.</p>

In such transactions or reorganizations/restructurings, personal information and data of exvo.com users will generally be transferred business assets. We reserve the right to include your personal information, collected as an asset, in such a transfer to a third party.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
