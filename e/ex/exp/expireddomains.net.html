<h3>Data processing (with an account)</h3>

<h4>Successful registration of an account and its use</h4>
<p>
	In addition to the data processing (with or without an account), the following additional
	data processed is required for registration of an account and its use.
	Registration is only successfully completed after a so-called double opt-in.
	For this purpose, an e-mail will be sent to the specified e-mail address and only after the
	visit of the activation link contained therein, the account is activated and the
	registration completed.
	Accounts without this activation can not be used and will be deleted automatically.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Intended Use</strong>: Access to the free members area, authentication of the user,
	internal identification of the user as well as account management (e.g., creating a new password)<br>
	<strong>Basis for data processing</strong>: Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR, the data subject has given consent
	to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.<br>
	<strong>Retention period</strong>: This personal data is stored indefinitely.
	Inactive accounts that have not been used for 366 days will be automatically and without additional
	request, with all associated data deleted.
	In addition, at any time an immediate deletion of the account and all related
	data can be requested free of charge. Just use the <a href="/contact/">contact form</a> or
	the addresses specified in the <a href="/impressum/">Impressum</a>.

	* Your e-mail address will only be used to manage your account (for example, delivery of a new password).
	It is not used for sending newsletters, promotional e-mails or similar e-mails.
	That means you will not receive emails from us that you did not explicitly request.
</p>

<a name="sessioncookie"></a>
<p>
	** For continuous authentication, a so-called <strong>Session Cookie</strong> is required.
	The session cookie contains a temporary automatically generated ID and will be processed
	by your browser after a successful login.
	The Cookie name is <strong>ExpiredDomainssessid</strong>.
	It is absolutely necessary to use your account.
	It has a maximum validity of 12 hours.
	This is reset every time a ExpiredDomains.net web page is visited.
	It will only be saved for the duration of your session.
	This means that as soon as you close your browser, it will automatically be deleted.
	Your next successful login will create a new <strong>Session Cookie</strong>.
</p>



<a name="remecookie"></a>
<h4>Optional cookie for automatic login (Remember Me)</h4>
<p>
	This cookie is used to implement the so-called <strong>Remember Me</strong> feature.
	It is not necessary to use your account. It can be used on the login page
	by checking the field <strong>Remember Me</strong>.<br>

	<strong>Intended Use</strong>: Automatic login without reentering your username and password.<br>
	<strong>Basis for data processing</strong>: Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR, the data subject has given consent
	to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.<br>
	<strong>Retention period</strong>: The Remember Me Cookie is valid for 3 months.
	After expiration, the cookie will be deleted automatically by your browser.
	The cookie contains your username and a temporary auto-generated ID.
	You can invalidate all your <strong>Remember Me Cookies</strong> by using the logout
	function in the member area.

<h3>Additional Information</h3>

<a name="bcrypt"></a>
<h4>Password security</h4>
<p>
	Passwords are never stored in a readable clear form.
	They are only stored as a hash value.
	The used hash function is Bcyrpt which was especially developed for hashing and saving
	of passwords (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt" target="_blank">Wikipedia regarding Bcrypt</a>).
</p>



<h4>SSL or TLS encryption</h4>
<p>
	For security reasons, all websites can only be reached via an encrypted connection.
	You can recognize an encrypted connection by looking at the address bar of the browser.
	"http://" changes to "https://" and the lock icon in your browser bar.
</p>




<h4>Revoke your consent to data processing</h4>
<p>
	Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent.
	You can revoke an existing consent at any time.
	An informal message by e-mail to us is sufficient.
	The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
</p>



<h4>Right to data portability</h4>
<p>
	You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us,
	in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and you have the right to transmit
	this data to another party.
	If you require the direct transfer of data to another person, this only happens if it is technically feasible.
</p>



<h4>Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority</h4>
<p>
	In the case of violations of data protection law, the person concerned has a right of appeal to the
	responsible supervisory authority.
	Responsible supervisory authority in data protection questions is the state data protection officer
	of the federal state in which our company is based (Berlin).
	A list of data protection officers and their contact details can be found on the following link:
