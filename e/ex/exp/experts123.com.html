Like most websites, we use cookies to keep track of           your activity on our Website(s) and enhance your experience. We also use cookies           to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password, and if you           choose, to save other personal and financial information so you do not have to           re-enter it each time you visit our Website(s). A cookie may also be placed by           our advertising server. Such cookies are used for purposes of tracking the           effectiveness of advertising served by us on our. Similarly, a cookie may be           placed by our third-party advertising companies. If you wish to disable these           cookies, the "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how.           However, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to           access certain areas or features of the Website(s).</p>      <h2>          Other Information We Collect</h2>      <p class="legal-section">          When browsing our Website(s), you are not required to provide any personal           information unless and until you choose to sign up for one of our Experts123           features or other services as described below. We do not knowingly permit our           Website(s) to be used by any person under the age of eighteen and we do not           knowingly collect any personal information from children (meaning those younger           than thirteen years of age). We store the data we collect on our own servers and           on servers owned by others. We undertake ongoing efforts to assure the integrity           and security of the data on our servers, but cannot guarantee that the security           measures we employ will always be completely effective. We also cannot guarantee           the absolute security of data we store on servers owned by others. We will           provide notice on our Website(s) if we have reason to believe the integrity of           our stored data has been breached or compromised, potentially permitting           unauthorized third-parties to access the stored data.</p>      <h2>          Registered User Information</h2>      <p class="legal-section">          If you choose to become a Registered User of Experts123.com you must provide           your name, address, e-mail address, a unique login name, password, and password           validation, and a password hint to help you remember your password. This           information is collected on the registration form for several reasons including:           (1) personal identification; (2) to allow us to contact you for customer service           purposes, if necessary; (3) to customize the content of our Website(s) to meet           your specific needs; and (4) to make product improvements to our Website(s).</p>      <h2>          Automatic Logging of Session Data</h2>      <p class="legal-section">          We automatically log generic information about your computer's connection to the           Internet, which we call "session data", that is anonymous and not linked to any           personal information. Session data consists of things such as IP address,           operating system and type of browser software being used and the activities           conducted by the user while on our Website(s). An IP address is a number that           lets computers attached to the Internet, such as our web servers, know where to           send data back to the user, such as the pages of the website the user wishes to           view. We collect session data because it helps us analyze such things as what           items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking           through the website, how many visitors are surfing to various pages on the           website, how long visitors to the website are staying and how often they are           visiting. We also record the URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) of the websites           you have visited prior to arriving at our Website(s) and the URLs of the           destinations you visit after you leave our Website(s). Collecting this           information also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better           administer our systems. You should know it is possible to determine from an IP           address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the approximate           geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. Third-party advertising           companies may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness           of ads.</p>      <h2>          Telephone Tracking Data</h2>      <p class="legal-section">          If a user (including both Registered Users and visitors) places a telephone call           to a number provided by our Website(s), we and/or our advertising partners may           record, track and or meter the telephone number of originating the call on our           own behalf or on behalf of others offering products or services on our           Website(s). We and/or our advertising partners may also store referring           telephone numbers.</p>      <h2>          Other</h2>      <p class="legal-section">          From time to time we may add or enhance services available on our Website(s). To           the extent these services are provided and used by you, we will use the           information you provide to facilitate the service requested. For example, if you           email us with a question, we will use your email address, name, nature of the           question, etc. to respond to your question. We may also store such information           to assist us in making our Website(s) the better and easier to use.</p>      <h2>          Information Other Websites Collect From You</h2>      <p class="legal-section">          On our Website(s), we place links to other web sites operated by other parties.           Some of these other web sites contain our brand names and trademarks and other           intellectual property that we own; others do not. When you click on these links           and visit these other web sites, regardless of whether or not they contain our           brand names, trademarks and other intellectual property, you need to be aware           that we do not control these other web sites or these other web sites' business           practices, and that this privacy policy does not apply to these other web sites.           Consequently, the operators of these other web sites may collect different kinds           of information about you, and may use and disclose that information in different           ways than we would if it were collected on our Website(s). We encourage you to           review their privacy policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for           their actions.</p>      <h2>          Sharing Your Information</h2>      <p class="legal-section">          When you use our Website(s) or provide us with information, we may share           personal information among our corporate affiliates at Experts123, LLC.           including, but not limited to our affiliates. For example, if you submit a           review or rating, we may share your review with our other Website(s), as well as           unaffiliated users of such data including suppliers, advertisers, affiliates and           other current and potential business partners. We may also use such aggregate           data to inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and           clicked on links to their web sites. Occasionally, we may hire a third party to           act on our behalf for projects such as market-research surveys and will provide           information to these third parties specifically for use in connection with these           projects.</p>      <p class="legal-section">          In addition to the circumstances described above, we may disclose your           information as part of a validation process in the interest of preventing fraud,           to provide proper accounting to our business partners (for advertising listings           and related programs) and to validate our business metrics including number of           clicks, referrer logs and other tracking information. We may also disclose your           information if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other           government or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that           disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable including, without limitation, to           protect our rights or properties of our affiliated companies or when we have           reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify,           contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference           with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when           anyone else could be harmed by such activities. In addition, if Experts123, LLC           or substantially all of its assets are acquired, our customer information will           most likely also be transferred in connection with such acquisition.</p>      <h2>          Demographic Information and Saved Listings</h2>      <p class="legal-section">          We use demographic and listing information to customize our Website(s) and           communications to the interests of our users. We may share demographic           information and relevant data with advertisers and other third parties so that           they can target their advertisements and communications to the appropriate           audience. Demographic and listing data we provide to advertisers and other third           parties may be linked to information you have provided as a Registered User so           that advertisers and third parties can target the offerings presented to you. We           may capture, correct, enhance, extrapolate and store additional information and           data based on information you supply, including without limitation data relating           to your geographic location, IP address and provider, email and other           demographic information. We may also enhance the information we collect from you           with additional information collected by third parties to correct, match,           enhance or complete the data you have provided. We may store and share this           enhanced information on an individual or aggregated basis.</p>      <h2>          How We Use Public Information, Reviews, Ratings and Registered User Names</h2>      <p class="legal-section">          When you become a Registered User, you must enter a user name. Our Website(s)           provide you with the opportunity to give reviews, opinions and ratings.

Your Registered User name and information may also appear on           a Registered User Profile section of our Website(s). We may also use and           disclose your Registered User name, information and reviews and ratings in any           other manner. To read further details about how we may use your user name,           information and reviews, see our Terms of and Conditions of Use.</p>      <h2>          Opt Out</h2>      <p class="legal-section">          At any time, you can unsubscribe being a Registered User by clicking on the           "cancel account" link and following the instructions.

Registered Users will be notified via e-mail prior           to any actions taken.</p>      <p class="legal-section">          After you submit personal information in connection with becoming a Registered           User or other programs (such as discount or rewards programs), offered or           sponsored by third parties on our Website(s), we may use such information to           send you marketing emails. However, if we do so, we will provide a link that you           can click on to opt-out of receiving subsequent marketing emails generated from           the same such information.</p>      <p class="legal-section">          Please note that changing or deleting your information otherwise opting-out of           receipt of email communications from us will only change or delete the data for           purposes of future activity on our Website(s) and for managing future           communications. These changes and deletions will not change or delete           information that we may have already forwarded to our affiliates or any other           third parties, all as provided above in this privacy policy. This includes any           reviews, ratings or other user-generated data previously provided to us.</p>      <p class="legal-section">          If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, the practices           of our Website(s), or your dealings with the Website(s), you can contact us as           indicated below:</p>      <p class="legal-section">          E-mail: <a href="mailto:customerservice@experts123.com">customerservice@experts123.com</a></p>      <p>          Mailing address:      </p>      <p style="margin-left: 20px">          Experts123, LLC</p>      <p style="margin-left: 20px">          PO Box 251942<br>          Los Angeles, CA 90025</p>      <br><br>  </div>
