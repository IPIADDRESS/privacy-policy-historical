Unless we have your express consent, Express will not sell, rent, loan, trade or lease your personal information to any third party.

    <li>Participate in a promotion or online survey in which we ask you for contact information (like e-mail address), and we may ask for additional optional survey information (like service preferences). We use this information to administer the program or activity, to notify winners, and, if you give us your opt-in consent at the time we collect your information, to send you promotional  materials.</li>
    <li>Contact Express with a question or suggestion in which we collect your name, e-mail address and any comments you have. We only use this information to respond to and/or resolve your question or concern.</li>

Your information will not be made available to outside companies or entities.</li>

  </ul>
<p></p>

<h4>Cookies, Web Beacons And Third Party Advertisers</h4>
<p>Cookies  may be used to keep track of what you have selected as  you click through our site. When filling out an online forms, session cookies may be used to capture an applicant's progress as they complete portions of the forms up to and including the point of submission. We may use cookies to allow you to access areas  of our Web site that are limited to registered users. We do not, however, use cookies to track the navigational habits of identified  visitors. Furthermore, we do not allow other companies (third parties) to set cookies via Express Web sites. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually refuse cookies, or  selectively accept cookies, by adjusting the preferences in your browser. If you turn cookies off, there may be some features of our site that will not be available to you and some Web pages may not display properly. You can find information about how you can  adjust your cookie setting at the following Web sites: Microsoft Internet Explorer:  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm</a> and Netscape Navigator:  <a href="http://www.netscape.com/legal_notices/cookies.html">http://www.netscape.com/legal_notices/cookies.html</a>. Express web sites do not use electronic images known as Web beacons, or clear GIFs to monitor the activity of our Web site. Express does not use third party advertising companies to provide  advertisements or allow third party advertisers to track your browsing activities on Express web sites.</p>

<h4>Sharing Information</h4>
<p>Unless we have your express consent, Express will not sell, rent, loan, trade or  lease personal information such as membership data or e-mail lists to any third party. We treat all information you provide as confidential. Occasionally, we may contract with other companies to provide limited services on our behalf such as packaging, mailing and delivering orders and processing event registration. From time to time, we may be required to provide personal information in response to a valid court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. Unless prevented by law, we will notify you prior to the release of such information. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good  faith, believe to be unlawful. We may release certain personal information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves.</p>

<h4>How  Information Is Used</h4>
<p>You remain in control of your information. Express will not use or share the  personal information we collect in ways unrelated to the purpose for which you provided the information without first obtaining your consent (opt-in). At the time you provide your information, you can choose whether you want to receive further communications about  special offers, product information or other marketing messages. If we collect your information and you are not presented with a choice, that indicates the  information you submit will only be used to fulfill your request. If you do opt-in to  marketing communications from Express, you can opt-out at any time. All e-mail  communications from us, such as newsletters, tell you how to stop receiving them.</p>

<h4>Security Of Personal Information</h4>
<p>Express uses a variety of safeguards to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. For example, we use internet and network security technology to prevent unauthorized parties from  viewing any personal information transmitted to or from Express. We only provide access to your personal information to Express employees and other authorized parties on a "need to know" basis. We have also  registered with Verisign and have obtained digital certificates for our web sites and subdomains, allowing your browser to confirm our server's identity. Please be careful whenever sending personal information to Express via e-mail.  E-mail commonly may not be a completely secure means of transferring information.</p>

<h4>How Long Information Is Stored</h4>
<p>Express believes it is important, for privacy and security reasons, to delete information when it is no longer needed. Data retention periods differ depending on the type of information collected and its intended purpose. For example, we will store your e- mail address if you've subscribed to one of our newsletters until you opt-out (tell us you  no longer wish to receive communications from us). If you order services from  us, account and billing information will be archived according to legal requirements. If you  send us a question or concern, we will maintain your information for a reasonable period  of time and then delete it.</p>

<h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
<p>If there are changes or additions to this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes so that you will always know what information we collect online or offline, how we use it  and what choices you have. Regardless of any changes we make to our Privacy Policy,  we will only use your personal information in accordance with the version of the Privacy  Policy in place at the time you provided your information, unless you later give your  express consent for us to do otherwise.</p>
