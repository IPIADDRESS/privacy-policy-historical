            <p> ExploreLearning provides interactive services 
              on the Internet to enable members to express themselves and share 
              their ideas and interests by creating and participating in a virtual 
              community focused on education. To promote trust and confidence 
              in the Internet and in ExploreLearning, we are providing a full 
              disclosure of our privacy practices and information uses.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              One of our goals is to respect the privacy rights of anyone who 
              joins ExploreLearning or visits an ExploreLearning site. Except 
              as set forth within this privacy statement and within the scope 
              of our member and site agreements, we do not release personally 
              identifiable information about our individual members and visitors 
              without their permission. We do collect information from our members 
              and visitors. The following is a statement of how we use that information, 
              as well as a statement about how, and if, we disseminate the information.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              If you feel that ExploreLearning has violated this statement on 
              privacy in any way, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@explorelearning.com">support@explorelearning.com</a>, 
              so that we may address this issue. Please note that the information 
              provided in this statement relates only to ExploreLearning's policies 
              and practices. ExploreLearning is not responsible for the content 
              or the privacy policies of websites to which it may link. ExploreLearning 
              also reserves the right to modify this statement policy, although 
              we will not do so without notifying our current ExploreLearning 
              members.</p>
            <p><span class="small"> <a href="#thetop" title="Go back to the top of the page.">Return 
              to the Top</a></span> </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;<a name="2"></a><em>2. What Information Do We Compile?</em></p>
            <p> For everyone who visits the ExploreLearning sites, we log IP addresses, 
              the type of operating system that the visitor's computer uses, and 
              the type of browser software used by the visitor. From the IP address, 
              we can determine the internet service provider and the geographic 
              location of the visitor's point of connectivity.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              If a visitor (such as a student) wants to use ExploreLearning sites 
              in a generic way (i.e. reading, but no contribution of content), 
              they are not required to register. However, if a visitor wants to 
              take advantage of the member services offered at ExploreLearning 
              sites (i.e. course page creation, posting in discussion forums, 
              etc.), we require that the visitor become a registered member by 
              providing us with their name, login name, password, zip code, and 
              valid e-mail address. Members can also supply additional optional 
              information about themselves such as location, course level, etc.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              ExploreLearning currently uses cookies to save, facilitate, and 
              maintain a member's login session, and to track site usage. A "cookie" 
              is a file transferred from a website to the hard drive of your computer 
              so that the website may track your activities on the website. A 
              cookie will not let a website know any personally identifying information 
              about you, such as your real name, address, etc., unless you previously 
              provided that information at the website or have set your preferences 
              in your browser to provide that information. ExploreLearning is 
              not generally interested in any one individual and does not collect 
              personally identifiable information about any persons using cookies.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              <!-- In our discussion forums, we do save all posted messages. This discussion content is kept for an indeterminate amount of time and is accessible to all members and visitors at ExploreLearning . All posted messages created by an individual are accessible as a grouped listing via our member profile feature (i.e. by clicking on a member's name when it appears on the site, a visitor can view any profile information this member has made public, and can view all messages posted by this member at a glance). -->
              We save all course content (e.g. activity guides, resources) created 
              by members for an indeterminate amount of time, but this content 
              can be amended, made private, or deleted by its author at any time. 
              (In this case, "private" means that only the member who created 
              the content can access it.) ExploreLearning may also choose to highlight 
              some of the content on its website, e.g., what it may consider as 
              the "best content" from time to time.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              ExploreLearning will generally adopt this policy toward any type 
              of member-contributed content in the future, such as an activity 
              guide, lesson, links, or any other educational content, subject 
              to the terms and conditions of the member agreement of <a href="http://www.exploremath.com/about/privacy.cfm" target="_blank">ExploreMath.com</a> 
              or <a href="http://www.explorescience.com/about/privacy.cfm" target="_blank">Explorescience.com</a>, 
              as appropriate. In these cases, contributed content will be attributed 
              to the members that created or supplied the information, and in 
              most cases, these members will have the means to either modify this 
              content or change its accessibility on the site.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              However, ExploreLearning does not and cannot otherwise control the 
              acts of its members and visitors. All members and visitors should 
              be aware that, when they disclose personal information such as their 
              actual name, login name, e-mail address, etc., the information may 
              be collected and used by others to send that person unsolicited 
              e-mail from other parties, and such acts necessarily lie outside 
              ExploreLearning's control.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              In general, ExploreLearning does not seek to edit, moderate or remove 
              any member-contributed content, but reserves the right to do so 
              in its sole discretion, such as, for example, where it considers 
              the material to be inappropriate. The terms and conditions governing 
              the use of and contributions to this website, which members agree 
              to abide by when they register with us, can be found <a href="legal.cfm" title="Read the terms and conditions in the member agreement.">here</a>.</p>
            <p><span class="small"> <a href="#thetop" title="Go back to the top of the page.">Return

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><a name="3"></a><em>3. How do we internally use the data about our 
              members and visitors?</em></p>
            <p> We generally use the aggregate data we collect to evaluate the 
              extent to which the ExploreLearning websites continue to be useful 
              and relevant to our members and the general public. For example, 
              we may perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics 
              and behavior of our members and visitors, to measure overall user 
              demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the ExploreLearning 
              domain and to analyze how and where to use our resources. We may 
              also use the aggregate data to inform any sponsors and/or advertisers 
              as to the profile and number of people who have seen and clicked 
              on their advertisement. No personally identifiable information will 
              be disclosed to any sponsor or advertiser as part of this process; 
              only information in an aggregate form may be used. Without the data 
              collected, we would not know what the most popular sections of ExploreLearning 
              are, we would not be able to provide an effective forum for sponsors 
              to advertise in, and we would be unable to measure the effectiveness 
              of any possible promotions.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              In addition, ExploreLearning does not share any personally identifiable 
              information with outside parties for commercial purposes, unless 
              stated at the time of collection. At the time of collection, the 
              option is given to disallow ExploreLearning to share such information 
              with outside parties. If members or visitors opt for such an option, 
              we will not share such information with outside parties; however, 
              we do reserve the right to release that information concerning a 
              member when the member partakes in an illegal activity, or for a 
              member who we believe is in violation of our content guidelines, 
              even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order. ExploreLearning 
              hopes that all members, visitors and third parties adhere to our 
              policies regarding the privacy of our members; however, ExploreLearning 
              does not assume any responsibility for any actions of third parties.</p>
            <p><span class="small"> <a href="#thetop" title="Go back to the top of the page.">Return

            <p><a name="4"></a><em>4. Do we allow an opt-out from the collection 
              of data on an individual?</em></p>
            <p> During the registration process for ExploreLearning membership, 
              we do require that individuals supply personal information. The 
              fields that we require to be completed include login name, first 
              name, last name, password, e-mail address, and zip code. We also 
              ask if that individual would like to periodically receive promotional 
              e-mail about products or services offered by ExploreLearning or 
              its partners.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              If at any time a member would like to receive or defer these mailings, 
              the member profile should be changed to indicate his or her new preference 
              using the <i>My Profile</i> page from their membership <i>Start 
              Page</i>. </p>

            <p>&nbsp;<a name="5"></a><em>5. What is our policy on removing information 
              about a person?</em></p>
            <p> We keep all general information (including postings and member-contributed 
              material, as described above) for an indeterminate amount of time. 
              All personal information of our members may be changed at any time 
              by using the profile page. If a member ceases to use ExploreLearning, 
              there may be residual information which will remain within the ExploreLearning 
              database and records. This residual information will not be used 
              for commercial purposes, except as part of any aggregate data about 
              our membership as a whole. This information also ensures that such 
              member will continue to receive credit for any content they may 
              have contributed while they were active. From time to time, we may 
              contact non-active members.</p>
