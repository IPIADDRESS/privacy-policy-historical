			<h2><a name="1" id="1"></a><em>1. Introduction</em></h2> 
			<p>
				ExploreLearning provides interactive services on the Internet to enable members to express themselves and share their ideas and interests by creating and participating in a virtual community focused on education. To promote trust and confidence in the Internet and in ExploreLearning, we are providing a full disclosure of our privacy practices and information uses.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of our goals is to respect the privacy rights of anyone who joins ExploreLearning or visits an ExploreLearning site. Except as set forth within this privacy statement and within the scope of our member and site agreements, we do not release personally identifiable information about our individual members and visitors without their permission. We do collect information from our members and visitors. The following is a statement of how we use that information, as well as a statement about how, and if, we disseminate the information.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you feel that ExploreLearning has violated this statement on privacy in any way, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@explorelearning.com">support@explorelearning.com</a>, so that we may address this issue. Please note that the information provided in this statement relates only to ExploreLearning's policies and practices. ExploreLearning is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of websites to which it may link. ExploreLearning also reserves the right to modify this statement policy, although we will not do so without notifying our current ExploreLearning members.
			</p>

			<h2>&nbsp;<a name="2" id="2"></a><em>2. What Information Do We Compile?</em></h2> 
			<p>
				For everyone who visits the ExploreLearning sites, we log IP addresses, the type of operating system that the visitor's computer uses, and the type of browser software used by the visitor. From the IP address, we can determine the internet service provider and the geographic location of the visitor's point of connectivity.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a visitor (such as a student) wants to use ExploreLearning sites in a generic way (i.e. reading, but no contribution of content), they are not required to register. However, if a visitor wants to take advantage of the member services offered at ExploreLearning sites (i.e. course page creation, posting in discussion forums, etc.), we require that the visitor become a registered member by providing us with their name, login name, password, zip code, and valid e-mail address. Members can also supply additional optional information about themselves such as location, course level, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				ExploreLearning currently uses cookies to save, facilitate, and maintain a member's login session, and to track site usage. A "cookie" is a file transferred from a website to the hard drive of your computer so that the website may track your activities on the website. A cookie will not let a website know any personally identifying information about you, such as your real name, address, etc., unless you previously provided that information at the website or have set your preferences in your browser to provide that information. ExploreLearning is not generally interested in any one individual and does not collect personally identifiable information about any persons using cookies.
			</p>
			<p>
<!-- In our discussion forums, we do save all posted messages. This discussion content is kept for an indeterminate amount of time and is accessible to all members and visitors at ExploreLearning . All posted messages created by an individual are accessible as a grouped listing via our member profile feature (i.e. by clicking on a member's name when it appears on the site, a visitor can view any profile information this member has made public, and can view all messages posted by this member at a glance). -->
				We save all course content (e.g. activity guides, resources) created by members for an indeterminate amount of time, but this content can be amended, made private, or deleted by its author at any time. (In this case, "private" means that only the member who created the content can access it.) ExploreLearning may also choose to highlight some of the content on its website, e.g., what it may consider as the "best content" from time to time.
			</p>
			<p>
				ExploreLearning will generally adopt this policy toward any type of member-contributed content in the future, such as an activity guide, lesson, links, or any other educational content, subject to the terms and conditions of the member agreement of <a href="http://www.exploremath.com/about/privacy.cfm" target="_blank">ExploreMath.com</a> or <a href="http://www.explorescience.com/about/privacy.cfm" target="_blank">ExploreScience.com</a>, as appropriate. In these cases, contributed content will be attributed to the members that created or supplied the information, and in most cases, these members will have the means to either modify this content or change its accessibility on the site.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, ExploreLearning does not and cannot otherwise control the acts of its members and visitors. All members and visitors should be aware that, when they disclose personal information such as their actual name, login name, e-mail address, etc., the information may be collected and used by others to send that person unsolicited e-mail from other parties, and such acts necessarily lie outside ExploreLearning's control.
			</p>
			<p>
				In general, ExploreLearning does not seek to edit, moderate or remove any member-contributed content, but reserves the right to do so in its sole discretion, such as, for example, where it considers the material to be inappropriate. The terms and conditions governing the use of and contributions to this website, which members agree to abide by when they register with us, can be found <a href="legal.html" title="Read the terms and conditions in the member agreement.">here</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>
			<h2><a name="3" id="3"></a><em>3. How do we internally use the data about our members and visitors?</em></h2> 
			<p>
				We generally use the aggregate data we collect to evaluate the extent to which the ExploreLearning websites continue to be useful and relevant to our members and the general public. For example, we may perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our members and visitors, to measure overall user demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the ExploreLearning domain and to analyze how and where to use our resources. We may also use the aggregate data to inform any sponsors and/or advertisers as to the profile and number of people who have seen and clicked on their advertisement. No personally identifiable information will be disclosed to any sponsor or advertiser as part of this process; only information in an aggregate form may be used. Without the data collected, we would not know what the most popular sections of ExploreLearning are, we would not be able to provide an effective forum for sponsors to advertise in, and we would be unable to measure the effectiveness of any possible promotions.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, ExploreLearning does not share any personally identifiable information with outside parties for commercial purposes, unless stated at the time of collection. At the time of collection, the option is given to disallow ExploreLearning to share such information with outside parties. If members or visitors opt for such an option, we will not share such information with outside parties; however, we do reserve the right to release that information concerning a member when the member partakes in an illegal activity, or for a member who we believe is in violation of our content guidelines, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order. ExploreLearning hopes that all members, visitors and third parties adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our members; however, ExploreLearning does not assume any responsibility for any actions of third parties.
			</p>

			<h2><a name="4" id="4"></a><em>4. Do we allow an opt-out from the collection of data on an individual?</em></h2> 
			<p>
				During the registration process for ExploreLearning membership, we do require that individuals supply personal information. The fields that we require to be completed include login name, first name, last name, password, e-mail address, and zip code. We also ask if that individual would like to periodically receive promotional e-mail about products or services offered by ExploreLearning or its partners.
			</p>
			<p>
				If at any time a member would like to receive or defer these mailings, the member profile should be changed to indicate his or her new preference using the <em>My Profile</em> page from their membership <em>Start Page</em>. 
			</p>

			<h2>&nbsp;<a name="5" id="5"></a><em>5. What is our policy on removing information about a person?</em></h2> 
			<p>
				We keep all general information (including postings and member-contributed material, as described above) for an indeterminate amount of time. All personal information of our members may be changed at any time by using the profile page. If a member ceases to use ExploreLearning, there may be residual information which will remain within the ExploreLearning database and records. This residual information will not be used for commercial purposes, except as part of any aggregate data about our membership as a whole. This information also ensures that such member will continue to receive credit for any content they may have contributed while they were active. From time to time, we may contact non-active members.
