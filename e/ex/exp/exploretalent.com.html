                    This privacy policy was last revised on June 21, 2003. Each 
                    time you visit the Site or provide us with information, by 
                    doing so you are accepting the practices described in this 
                    privacy policy at that time. <br>

                    <p>Like most e-commerce Websites, each time you visit the 
                      Site, we automatically collect your IP address and the web 
                      page from which you came. In order to administer and optimize 
                      the Site for you and to diagnose problems with our Site, 
                      we use your IP address to help identify you and to gather 
                      broad demographic information about you. <br>

                    <p><br>
                      Cookies</p>
                    <p>Like most Websites, the Site uses cookies to keep track 
                      of your purchases and other activity on the Site and enhance 
                      your experience on the Site. We also use cookies to deliver 
                      content specific to your interests, to save your password, 
                      and if you choose, to save other personal and financial 
                      information so you do not have to reenter it each time you 
                      visit the Site. If you wish to disable these cookies, the 
                      "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers 
                      will tell you how. However, if you set your browser to disable 
                      cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas on 
                      the Site. </p>

                      Information We Collect From You</p>
                    <p>In order to operate the Site and to provide you with information 
                      about products or services that may be of interest to you, 
                      we may collect "personal information" (i.e. information 
                      that could be used to contact you directly (without using 
                      the Site) such as full name, postal address, phone number 
                      or email address), "financial information" (i.e. 
                      credit card numbers or passwords) or "demographic information" 
                      (i.e. information that you submit, or that we collect, that 
                      is neither personal information nor financial information; 
                      this may include, but is not limited to, zip code, postal 
                      code, hometown, gender, username, age/birth date, purchase 
                      history information, browsing history information, searching 
                      history information, registration history information, and 
                      the content of communications between you and other members 
                      over the Site), subject to the rest of this paragraph. Demographic 
                      information is divided into two categories: 1) "non-public 
                      information", which consists of purchase history information 
                      and one-on-one communications between you and other users 
                      of the Site; and 2) "public information", which 
                      consists of all other demographic information. We ask that 
                      you do not enter personal information or financial information 
                      into your "Profile" (for example, don't use your 
                      address or passcode as your username, or include your name 
                      or address in your written responses), because if you do 
                      then it may be posted publicly on the Site, and the information 
                      will then be treated as "demographic information" 
                      that is "public information." </p>

                    <p><br>
                      Information Other Websites Collect From You </p>
                    <p>On the Site, we place links to other Websites operated 
                      by other parties. Some of these other Websites contain our 
                      brand names and trademarks and other intellectual property 
                      that we own; others do not. When you click on these links 
                      and visit these other Websites, regardless of whether or 
                      not they contain our brand names, trademarks and other intellectual 
                      property, you need to be aware that we do not control these 
                      other Websites or these other Websites' business practices, 
                      and that this privacy policy does not apply to these other 
                      Websites. Consequently, the operators of these other Websites 
                      may collect different kinds of information about you, and 
                      may use and disclose that information in different ways 
                      than we would if it were collected on the Site. We encourage 
                      you to review their privacy policies and remind you that 
                      we will not be responsible for their actions. </p>
