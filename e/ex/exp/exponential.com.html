      <p class="privacy"><strong>Information We Collect <br>

        </strong><u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</u> Non-personally

        identifiable information is information that, by itself, cannot be tracked

        to a specific individual. &nbsp;Exponential® may collect non-personally

        site or the Web site of one of Exponential's® business customers, including

        advertisers, Web publishers, educational institutions, or financial service

        providing services, Exponential® may collect Web surfing data such

        as Web surfers' IP addresses, Web pages that have been visited, time

        and date, and whether or not a Web surfer clicked on various advertisements

        ("Web Surfing Data").</p>

      <p class="privacy">We use different types of technologies to collect this

        </strong><u>Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</u> Exponential®

        you with ads that we think you would be interested in seeing.</p>

      <p class="privacy">Exponential® may market its services by sharing

        or to prevent illegal activities or violations of Exponential's Terms

        of Use Agreement.</p>

      <p class="privacy">In the event that Exponential®, in whole or in

                    <strong>European Union <br>

                    </strong>The European Union privacy laws differ significantly

                    from U.S. laws. To reconcile these differences, the U.S.

                    and the European Union have created a set of guidelines called

                    a "Safe Harbor" that define mutually acceptable

                    privacy procedures. &nbsp;Exponential® adheres to the

                    Safe Harbor principals. &nbsp;For more information go to <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor" target="_blank" class="privacytextlinks">www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.<br>

                  <strong>Security<br>

                  </strong>Exponential® makes significant efforts to protect

                  except for the uses described above. &nbsp;Collected information

                  is not generally available to the public. Be aware, however,

                  that the Internet is not 100% secure. &nbsp;Therefore, we cannot

                  ensure the security of any information transmitted to us over
