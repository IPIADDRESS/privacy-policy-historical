    	<p>We respect your privacy and this policy explains how we use and protect the information we collect about you when you use this website; including co-branded or white labeled versions of our tools and other products. It does not apply to third-party websites. </p>
    	<p>By accessing or using our Services in the United States, you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of Your Information (collectively, "Use of Your Information") as described in this Privacy Policy. If you are accessing or using our Services in the European Economic Area ("EEA") or UK, please see the EEA/UK Addendum below.        </p>
    	<p><strong>How do we get information? </strong></p>
    	<p>To operate this website, and provide you with information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we (and partners on our behalf) collect several different types of information, as permitted by the law, in different ways:</p>
    	<ul>
  			<li>Sometimes you give us information. </li>
  			<li>Sometimes information about you is collected automatically. </li>
  			<li>Sometimes information we receive information about you from other third-party sources.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In all instances we ensure, the information we collect about you is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary. </p>
		<p><u>Account registration data</u></p>
		<p>When you create an ExpertFlyer.com account with us, you provide your full name and email address. </p>
		<p>If you create your ExpertFlyer.com account using your Facebook credentials, we will have access to some of your account information from that service, such as your name and email address. </p>
		<p><u>Payment data</u></p>
		<p>If you opt for a Pro Plan (Basic or Premium), you'll need to supply your address, zip or postal code, country of residence, as well as payment card information. Optionally, you may supply your telephone number.</p>
		<p>Our third-party payment gateway provider will confirm to us that transactions have been processed in accordance with our terms.</p>
		<p><u>Onsite forms</u></p>
		<p>If you complete a form hosted on one of our webpages, for instance, the contact us form, we will retain a record of that correspondence together with your name and email address.</p>
		<p><u>Website use data</u></p>
		<p>Information is generated and collected when you use our website, including: log data, pages visited, time on site, IP address, location information, browser type, language settings, and operating system.</p>
