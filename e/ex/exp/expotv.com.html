		<p>
			This policy applies to your use of all the sites
			and services owned or operated by Expo Communications, Inc. ("Expo") and
			affiliated companies (collectively "we," "us," or
			"our"), including www.expotv.com and any other site that we may own
			or operate currently or in the future (collectively, the "Sites"). This policy does not apply to your use of
			unaffiliated sites to which any of the Sites only link. The following discloses
			our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Sites. This
			privacy policy applies only to data gathered on the Sites and does not apply to
			any offline point of contact between Expo and consumers. This privacy policy is
			effective as of October 1, 2004.
		</p>

		<div class="header">Changes to the Privacy Policy</div>

		<p>
			We reserve the right to change the terms of this
			Privacy Policy. Since any changes will be posted on this page, we encourage you
			to check this page regularly. Your continued use of the Sites following any
			changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes.
		</p>

		<div class="header">Your IP Address</div>

		<p>
			Each time you visit the Sites, our Web server
			automatically collects your IP address and the Web page from which you came.
			Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic
			information about you. We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems
			with our servers, to administer the Sites, and to better serve you while
			visiting the Sites.
		</p>

		<div class="header">Cookies and Software</div>

		<p>
			The Sites use cookies to keep track of your
			activity on the Sites and enhance your experience on the Sites. Third parties
			present on the Sites, such as advertisers, may also place cookies on your browser.
		</p>

		<p>
			Most browsers are set to accept cookies. You can set your
			browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you
			do so, please note that some parts of the Sites may not function properly.
		</p>

		<p>
			Other than the cookies noted above, we will
			never download without your explicit permission any applications or other files
			to your hard drive.
		</p>

		<div class="header">Information We Collect From You</div>

		<p>
			While on the Sites, you may provide personal
			information such as your name, age, gender, address, and email address. Nowhere
			on the Sites do we knowingly collect personal information from children under
			the age of 13.
		</p>

		<div class="header">How We Use Personal Information</div>

		<p>
			We will use your personal information to contact
			you and provide you with information that you may request.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We may also use your personal information for
			internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our business. We may
			also combine the information we have gathered about you with information from
			other sources. We may use third parties
			to help us operate our business and the Sites or administer activities on our
			behalf. We may share your information with these third parties for those
			limited purposes.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Expo may share aggregate
			statistical information with its partners, suppliers and other third parties,
			but Expo will not share any individual names, personal navigational or other
			personal information.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Unless you tell us not to, we may also use your personal
			information to contact you about offers or promotions we think you would be
			interested in. If at any time you would
			like to stop receiving such information or opt-out of a feature, you can let us
			know by sending an e-mail stating your preference to <a href="mailto:privacy@expotv.com">privacy@expotv.com</a>. To help us address
			your request, please specify the feature from which you wish to opt out.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Please note that deletions of your personal
			information or changes in your preferences may not be effective immediately.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Your personal information may be passed on to a
			third party in the event of a transfer of ownership, assets or the bankruptcy
			of Expo. We may also disclose
			specific information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to
			comply with applicable law or to protect the interests or safety of Expo or
			other visitors to the Sites.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Please note that if you give out personal information
			online in public forums such as on an Expo message board or product review that
			information can be collected and used by third parties. Although Expo strives
			to protect its users' privacy, Expo cannot guarantee the security of
			information you post in these forums. You disclose such information at your own
			risk.
		</p>
		
		<div class="header">Email Marketing</div>

		<p>
			All of our email offerings are "opt-in" programs so you will
			never receive email from Expo that you haven’t authorized. We do not sell or rent lists of our users’
			email addresses to any third parties.
		</p>

		<div class="header">Other Sites</div>

		<p>
			The Sites may contain links to other Web sites,
			such as product manufacturer Web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy
			practices or the content of such Web sites or for the privacy policies and
			practices of other third parties. We
			encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party sites or services
			before providing any of them with your personal information.
		</p>

		<div class="header">Our Security Precautions</div>

		<p>
			The Sites have security measures in place to
			protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our
			control. We use industry standard technology to protect the security of your
			information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be
			guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we are committed to protecting
			your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
			you transmit to us.
		</p>

		<div class="header">Accessing Your Information</div>

		<p>
			Expo gives you the opportunity to remove personal information that you have provided to us or
			change your preferences. If you would like to review or delete any personal information we have retained about you in
			our database, please send us an email request at <a href="mailto:privacy@expotv.com">privacy@expotv.com</a>. To help us address your request, please
			specify which information you wish to review or delete. Deleting your information or otherwise
			opting-out of receipt of communications from Expo will delete the data only in
			our database for purposes of managing future communications from Expo.
