        <p class="pTag">Please note that you may choose whether or not you wish to permit us, a member of our Group or one of our partners to use your personal data for marketing purposes.</p>

        <p class="pTag">Should you require further information or if you have any questions regarding privacy or confidentiality issues, please contact our <a class="aLink" href="mailto:support@expekt.com">Customer Services Team</a>. Please take the time to read our Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy carefully.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Your personal data </h3>
        <p class="pTag">The information we collect enables us to ensure that our customers can enjoy safe and user-friendly browsing conditions. Our aim is to offer the best possible services, whilst making sure that betting and gaming on our Site remains a fun activity!</p>

        <p class="pTag">All references to ‘personal data’ in this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy refer to any personal information about a natural person which enables that individual to be identified directly or indirectly by reference to the data provided. Specifically, We collect the following information when you open an Account with us: first name; surname; gender; date of birth; place of residence; postal address; email address; phone number; language, currency, passport or ID card number and secret question. You will also be required to provide login details of your choice, namely a username, password and an answer to the secret question which will be kept by us. We additionally require you to provide us with a payment method and payment details (such as bank transfer, credit card or another acceptable means of payment) in order that you can credit your Account. Further, we will request that you send us a copy of an official document (e.g. passport, driving licence or other approved identity document) in order to confirm the accuracy of the data you have provided. We also use geolocation tools to record your internet protocol (IP) address and to compare it against your user identification in order to prevent fraudulent activities and also to create an audit trail. When you make a pre-registration sign-up and before you fully register as a customer, we request the following information from you: title, first name, surname, date of birth and email address. We store this information in order to provide you with a pre-populated registration form if and when you decide to fully register with us. When you access the Mobile Offer, we collect the following information: IP address, access provider and type/version of browser used. We require the above information in order to ensure that you can identify yourself when using the Site, to ensure that you are of legal age to use our services, to improve our services to you and to keep you informed regarding any of our services which may be of interest to you. You have the right to request that we cease forwarding marketing information about our, and/or our partners', services to you. You also have the right to access your personal data at any time in order to make alterations to any personal information that may have changed or become obsolete. Should you believe that any personal information we hold for you is incorrect, please email our customer services team at support@expekt.com and we will amend any information found to be incorrect.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Use of your personal data </h3>
        <p class="pTag">Once your personal data is submitted to us, it shall be kept securely on our database.</p>

  <p class="pTag">We use the email address which you have provided us with to send you an email welcoming you to Expekt. We may send you emails, letters by post and SMS messages from time to time containing information ranging from special promotions to technical and other information relating to our services and the services of our Group companies. Should you wish to unsubscribe from our mailing list, you can do this easily by either changing your Account settings or clicking “unsubscribe” on the bottom of the email. If you have agreed to receive offers from Expekt and/or partners on the pre-registration sign-up page and you later wish to unsubscribe, simply click on the ‘unsubscribe’ link on the email. Should you wish to unsubscribe from receiving SMS messages, you can do this easily by following the instructions to unsubscribe in the SMS message sent to you. Please note that we may from time to time send out service-related emails announcing, for instance, a temporary suspension of one or more of our services due to maintenance. IT IS THEREFORE RECOMMENDED THAT YOU DO NOT OPT OUT OF RECEIVING EMAILS FROM EXPEKT. If you have opted in to receive commercial offers from our select partners, you can unsubscribe from this mailing list by changing your settings in ‘My Account’ and ‘My Newsletters’.</p>

        <p class="pTag">If a customer chooses to use the Refer-A-Friend service in order to inform a friend about our Site, we will ask the customer for his/her friend’s email address and we will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting him/her to visit our Site and to register with us. If the friend does not sign up with Expekt, we do not store the friend’s email address in any database and we will not contact the friend after sending this email unless the same or another customer refers the friend to Expekt again via the Refer-A-Friend service. The Refer-A-Friend service may not be available in all jurisdictions or to all customers.</p>
       
        <p class="pTag">Top  5 Combined Bets: each week Expekt will publish the Top 5 Combined Bets made on  Expekt.com sportsbook. The information displayed will be as follows: odds,  stake, winnings and selections of the bet placed, together with first name and  first initial of surname of the customer.</p>
       
        <p class="pTag">As part of our partnership with commercial banks and/or the companies in charge of verifying the authenticity of credit card or electronic payment processing data, your personal data is at the disposal of these establishments. However, these establishments are only entitled to use such information for processing or legal investigation purposes (for example, in suspected anti-money laundering cases). We may also enter into partnerships with data processors and companies which provide security, age verification and identification verification services in order to improve the efficiency and security of the Site or to comply with relevant regulations. These companies may have access to your personal data in order that they can process necessary information data and maintain the security of the Site. The companies that we choose to carry out these functions have strict policies regarding privacy of personal data, although we accept no responsibility for the privacy policies of those companies. We will not disclose the amount of your winnings or losses to any person or third party other than to you unless we are required by law to disclose such information to competent authorities.

        <h3>6. Security </h3>        
        <p class="pTag">Expekt Gaming (Gibraltar) Limited is a company incorporated in Gibraltar with company number 105895  and which has its place of business at 62/64 Irish Town,  Gibraltar. Expekt is licensed under the Gambling Act 2005 by the Government of Gibraltar and regulated by the Gibraltar Gambling Commissioner. Expekt uses its best endeavours to protect the confidentiality of your personal data and to prevent any unauthorised external or internal users from accessing such information without your consent. However, Expekt shall take no responsibility whatsoever for events beyond its control inclusive of, but not limited to, acts of god or natural disasters and including power cuts and strikes.</p>

        <p class="pTag">We are sure that, as our customer, you understand the evolving nature of our business due to continuous technological innovation and, although we endeavour to do our best to ensure the protection and privacy of your personal data at all times, we cannot guarantee that the performance of our service will be free from error at all times. Should any such error have an effect or consequence on the privacy of your personal data, we shall not be liable in any manner whatsoever in damages or otherwise.</p>       

        <p class="pTag">We strongly recommend that you do not divulge your personal data to strangers or third parties during live chat. Remember that your personal data is sensitive and it’s important to stop and think before passing on personal information.</p>

        <p class="pTag" style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;">Log Files</p>
 
        <p class="pTag">Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>

        <p class="pTag" style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;">Data Encryption</p>

        <p class="pTag">All sensitive data which is transmitted between your computer and Expekt is transferred securely via the internet, using strong encryption. Expekt uses secure and tested encryption technology bearing certificates provided by renowned certificate authorities.</p>

        <p class="pTag" style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;">Other security measures</p>

        <p class="pTag">When users submit sensitive information via the Site, their information is protected both online and offline. When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected using Secure Socket Layer– (SSL) technology. While on a secure page, such as our deposit page, the lock icon at the bottom, or in the url, of your web browser becomes locked. The lock icon is unlocked, or open, when users are simply 'surfing' and are not inputting sensitive information. All payments made on our Site and Mobile Offer are secured, in compliance with the relevant EU rules and regulations.</p>

        <p class="pTag">While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information offline. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only authorised Expekt employees/contractors are granted access to personally identifiable information. We perform checks on all of our potential employees/contractors to ensure that none of them have a criminal record. Our employees/contractors are regularly made aware of security best practices within the industry and security audits are carried out on a regular basis. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.</p>
        
        <h3>7. Changes in our Company/Business Structure</h3>
        <p class="pTag">Should Expekt Gaming (Gibraltar) Limited or the Group undergo any changes to its company structure such as a merger, acquisition by another company or a partial acquisition, it is most likely that our customers’ personal data will be included within the sale or transfer. We will, as part of our policy, inform our customers by email prior to affecting such transfer of the personal data.</p>
        
        <h3>8. Modifications</h3>
        <p class="pTag">It may become necessary, at any time, for us to make modifications to the Site and/or Mobile Offer or to the House Rules, Terms and Conditions or Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy governing our services. The purpose of such modifications may be to further simplify user processes or to further reinforce security measures in order to upgrade to future technological innovations. In such cases, customers previously registered on our Site will keep their user name and password; no modifications will be required on their part. Continued use of our Site by the members after any modifications to the Site, Mobile Offer, House Rules, Terms and Conditions or Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy will be considered as their acceptance thereof. It is the responsibility of each customer to regularly check the House Rules, Terms and Conditions and Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy for updates.</p>
