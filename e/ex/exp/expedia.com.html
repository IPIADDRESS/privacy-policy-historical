<b><font color="#cc6600" face="Arial" size="2">Other information we collect</font></b>
<br>
Some information is collected automatically every time you visit Expedia.com. Expedia.com collects information about your computer and assigns you a "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file) when you visit Expedia.com. You do not provide this information—it is collected automatically as a means of supporting your visit to our site.

<b>Cookies and other Web technologies</b>
<br>
As a member or visitor to Expedia.com you will be assigned a permanent cookie file on your computer's hard drive. You can always choose to not receive a cookie file by enabling your Web browser to refuse cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie. Be advised that, by refusing to accept a cookie, you will not be able to access many travel services and planning tools offered by Expedia.com.  
</p><p>
When you access the <a href="/pub/agent.dll?qscr=litn">My Trips</a> or <a href="/pub/agent.dll?qscr=info">My Profile</a> areas of the Expedia.com Web site, reserve or purchase travel, or use selected travel planning tools, Expedia requires you to sign in as a member, using your Member ID and password.  Once you sign in as an Expedia.com member, we record the Member ID and the name on the member account in the cookie file on your computer. We may also record your password in this cookie file if you checked the box entitled "Save this password for automatic sign-in." Your Member ID, password, and the name on your member account is stored in the cookie file as encrypted data, so no one can view the information it contains by obtaining unauthorized access to your computer. Permanent cookie files remain on your computer's hard drive until you manually delete the file.
</p><p>
A cookie file may also be placed on your hard drive by Expedia.com's third-party advertising companies or by Microsoft, Expedia.com's Corporate Affiliate. These companies may use aggregated statistics about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about travel-related goods and services that you may be interested in. The information they collect does <b>not</b> include your PII.
</p><p>
The third-party advertising companies may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of ads. This is primarily accomplished through the use of an action tag (also known as an invisible gif), which the third party places on our site to collect anonymous information. They may use this anonymous information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. <b>No</b> PII is collected during this process. The information is anonymous and does not link online actions to an identifiable person.
</p><p>
<b>Computer information</b>
<br>
Expedia.com collects certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page during a visit to Expedia.com. This information is collected from your computer's Web browser and may include your IP address, operating system, Web browser software (i.e., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), screen resolution, and referrer Web site. Wireless users: Please check with your wireless company if you are using your cellular phone to access the Internet to understand whether PII may be used to identify you.

The third-party partner will send e-mail referrals to the persons you indicated. When your friends respond to the  referral and visit the Expedia.com site, a cookie is placed on their browsers to measure the effectiveness of our Web site.

<b>Service providers</b>
<br>
We only provide information about travel either reserved or purchased on Expedia.com to third parties that provide services or functions on behalf of Expedia.com. Our service providers need information about your traveler profile, as well as your credit card information, to process and confirm your travel reservation. These service providers will disclose information about your traveler profile to hotel, airline, cruise, and/or car rental suppliers whose products you have purchased. Like any other travel agent, this information must be shared with our travel suppliers to confirm your reservation and travel preferences. Although Expedia.com offers travel products from hotel, airline, cruise, and car rental suppliers that are reputable companies, we have not placed limitations on these suppliers from using or disclosing your information without your permission. Therefore, we encourage you to review the information privacy practices of any travel suppliers whose products you purchase on Expedia.com. In addition, these travel suppliers may also contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about your confirmed reservation.
</p><p>
Expedia.com will occasionally share aggregated information with our service providers. This information does not contain any PII and is used to develop featured programs and content that will be of interest to our members and site visitors.

In the event that you make a new, or update an existing, travel reservation by calling our toll-free number, your information may be accessed by a third-party service provider, as necessary, to respond to your request for customer service. 
</p><p>
Expedia.com may contract a reputable third-party to facilitate the distribution of survey, promotion, or sweepstakes programs. Upon completion of these projects, all information is returned to Expedia.com.
</p><p>
<b>Our legal obligations</b>
<br>
Expedia.com may be required by law to disclose information you have provided in obtaining our travel products or services. Expedia.com may also disclose information against someone who poses a threat to Expedia.com's interests (such as customer fraud) or whose activities could bring harm to others.
