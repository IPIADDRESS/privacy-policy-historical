<h1>Privacy policy </h1>

<p><i>Last updated: 7 May 2011. </i></p>

<p>
We take the issue of Internet privacy (what happens to people's personal information) very seriously.</p>

<p>Here (in plain English) are full details explaining what information our site collects from you and what happens to it after that.</p>

<h3>What information do we collect?</h3>

<p>Like <span class="italic">every</span> other website on the Net, our site is hosted on a web server
(a powerful computer at our ISP) that keeps a <span class="bold">log</span> of all the
pages and graphics it serves and where it sends them to.
This information is essentially anonymous and statistical: it tells us
how many people from Iceland looked at our site last Thursday, but it
doesn't tell us anything personal about them. We don't
know who those people were, whether they were fishermen or fighter
pilots, or what colour socks they were wearing at the time.</p>

<p>The logs don't tell us who you are or where you live—but they do
record your <span class="bold">IP number</span> (a
number that uniquely identifies your computer). They also note what you looked at or downloaded,
the operating system and browser you're
using, the date and time of your visit, how you came to our site, and
so on. Here is an example of one line from our log, recording one
hit from one visitor using the (made-up) IP number 12.34.56.78:</p>
<p><span class="pre">
12.34.56.78 - - [25/May/2010:13:05:41 +0100] "GET /transformers.html HTTP/1.0" 200 19986 "http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;q=why+we+use+transformers&amp;meta=
&amp;aq=4m&amp;aqi=g-c1g-m4&amp;aql=&amp;oq=use+transformers&amp;gs_rfai=" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)"</span></p>

<p>What can we deduce from this? That someone using computer 12.34.56.78 wanted to find out "why we use transformers" at 13:05
on Tuesday May 25 2010. They used Google India to get to our site, which they viewed using a Mozilla/Firefox
browser running under Windows. That's about it. <span class="bold">The information logged here is not personally identifiable</span>,
so we don't know who made this search or why—and frankly, we don't care.</p>

<p>How do we use this information? Contrary to what we've said, we don't actually look at our raw access logs:
a typical day's log has hundreds of thousands of entries like the one above! Instead, we run the logs through
a statistical package called <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/" target="_new">AWStats</a>
to show up daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly patterns in how people use our site. (If
you're really interested, you can see a <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/#DEMO" target="_new">demo</a> of
the kind of statistics that we can see.) What does this tell us? If we
know certain pages are unpopular, we can improve
them or discontinue them. If we know our server is about to crash
because too many people are looking at our global warming page again, we can get a bigger
server. If we know our RSS feeds are growing in popularity, we will
start to update them more often. This is the kind of thing we do with
our logs. Broadly speaking, they help us improve our website so
it better meets your needs.</p>

<p>Our website hosting system keeps each log until the end of the current month and then erases it
before starting a new one for the next month. So the absolute maximum amount of time for which
information about your visit to our site is retained on our system is one month. (If you visit
on the 31st of the month, the information is kept for only a day.)</p>

<h3>We do not use cookies—but our advertisers and affiliate partners do</h3>

<p>Explainthatstuff.com does not use <span class="bold">cookies</span>
(small files stored on a web browser). That means we don't offer a way
for you to opt-out of having your information collected
or a way to remove your personal information from our records—simply
because we don't collect any information about you. None whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
Please be aware, however, that our website runs <span class="bold">advertisements</span>
on most pages and we sometimes participate in <span class="bold">affiliate programs</span>
(partnerships with online shopping websites). The advertisers and affiliate partners we work with use cookies
to help them serve up their advertisements, to track your browsing
behavior, to make it easier for you to buy things from them (for
example, if you use a shopping cart on a website, that needs a cookie to make it work), and to record the
fact that it's our website that sent the traffic to them.</p>

<p>
We have no control over these <span class="bold">"third-party cookies"</span>
(as they are known). We do not see or have access to any information
they may store or collect.
They pass directly between your computer and the servers run by our
advertisers and affiliate partners. If you would like to know more about how our
advertisers and affiliate partners may be using cookies, please refer to the privacy policies on their websites for more information.</p>

<p>At the moment, Google is the only advertiser we are working with.

<h3>How can you control your privacy?</h3>
<p>
If you're concerned about cookies, you can change the options in your
Web browser to restrict
how websites can use them. You can switch off certain cookies, instruct
your browser to keep them only for certain periods, or delete cookies
altogether. You can set the
level of privacy controls you want by looking under Privacy
in your browser's options, preferences, or settings. Please be aware
that if you do this you may prevent some parts of some websites (such as shopping carts and personal preferences) 
from working properly.</p>

<h3>How can you find out more about privacy issues?</h3>
