			  Express Scripts respects the privacy of every individual who visits

			  Express Scripts will not collect any personally-identifiable information 
			  about you (that is, your name, address, telephone number, or email 
			  address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily. </font>
			</p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If

			  Express Scripts has no intention of collecting any personally-identifiable 
			  information (that is, name, address, telephone number, or email 
			  address) from individuals under 18 years of age. Where appropriate, 
			  Express Scripts will specifically instruct children not to submit 
			  such information on our Web sites or advertisements without consent 
			  of a parent or guardian. If a child has provided us with personally-identifiable 
			  information without the consent of a parent or guardian, a parent 
			  or guardian of that child should contact us at the email address 
			  listed at the bottom of this Statement if they would like this information 
			  deleted from our records. We will use reasonable efforts to delete 
			  the child's information from our existing files. </font>
			</p><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Non-Personally-Identifiable 
			  Information Collected Automatically</b><br>
			  In some cases, we may collect information about you that is not 
			  personally-identifiable. Examples of this type of information include 
			  the type of Internet Browser you are using, the type of computer 
			  operating system you are using, and the domain name of the Web site 
			  and/or Internet Service Provider from which you linked to our site 
			  or advertisement. </font>

			  of Cookies</b><br>
			  When you view one of our Web sites, we may store some information 
			  on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "Cookie" 
			  or similar file and will be used to determine ways to improve our 
			  Web sites, advertisements, products or services. With most Internet 
			  Browsers, you can erase Cookies from your computer hard drive, block 
			  all Cookies, or receive a warning before a Cookie is stored. Please

			</p><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Declining 
			  Email Offers</b><br>
			  As outlined in Section III of this Statement, we will only send 
			  email promotions or announcements to you if you have previously 
			  provided your permission for us to do so. Although many customers 
			  tell us they appreciate receiving notice of these carefully designed 
			  promotions and announcements, we recognize the importance of providing 
			  you with choices. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving 
			  these offers from us by simply replying to the email and informing 
			  us of your preferences. All email offers that you receive from Express 
			  Scripts will inform you of how to decline receiving further<br>
			  e mail offers. </font>

              like that information deleted from our records, please contact us.
