    ("the Site") or use the Expensify Service.

    seal.
</p>
<p>
    The TRUSTe program covers our collection, use and disclosure of information we collect through our website,

<h3>Important â€“ Transfer of Data to the US of European personal information</h3>
<p>
    Information that our European users submit through the Expensify Service or the Site is sent to and stored on secure
    servers located in the United States of America and may be transferred by us to our other offices and/or to the
    third parties (such as our Partner Companies), who may be situated in the United States of America or elsewhere
    outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA. The US and other
    non-EEA countries do not have similar data protection laws to the European Union, and you should be aware in
    particular that the law and practice in the United States in respect of law enforcement authority access to data is
    significantly different from Europe. Where we transfer your information we will take all reasonable steps to ensure
    that your privacy rights continue to be protected consistent with our obligations under local law. By submitting
    information via the Site, you agree to this storing, processing and/or transfer.
</p>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and considered a part of, the Expensify Terms of Service, currently
    located at&nbsp;https://www.expensify.com/terms. Any terms not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of
    Service.
</p>
<h2>1. MEMBER CONSENT</h2>
<p>
    By submitting or making available Personal Data (as defined below) through our website, the Expensify Software or
    the Expensify Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of
    your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2>2. A NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN</h2>
<p>
    We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 13. If we inadvertently hold or
    have access to Personal Data about anyone under 13, please let us know so we can delete it.
</p>
<h2>3. TYPES OF PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT</h2>
<p>
    Expensify collects Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit our Site, when you send us information
    or communications in connection with your use of the Expensify Service, and/or when you download and use the
    Expensify Software. "Personal Data" means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for
    example, your name, address, geographic location of your computer or mobile device, telephone number, credit card
    number, email address and bank account information, as well as any other non-public information about you that is
    associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. "Anonymous Data" means data about you that is not associated
    with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. We
    collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
</p>
<h3>Personal Data You Provide To Us</h3>
<p>
    We collect Personal Data from you, such as first and last name, email and mailing addresses, telephone number,
    professional title, company name, and password, when you register for the Expensify Service. In addition, we (or our
    third-party credit card or payment processor on our behalf) will collect Personal Data including your credit card
    number or account information when you upgrade to a paid account. We also retain information on your behalf, such as
    the Personal Data described above and any correspondence. If you provide us feedback or contact us via email, we
    will collect your name and email address, IP address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order
    to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us, such as a resume. If we conduct a survey in which
    you participate, we may collect additional profile information. We may also collect Personal Data at other instances
    in the Site or Application user experience where we state that Personal Data is being collected.
</p>
<p>
    If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name
    and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. If
    your friend is a resident of the European Union, please make sure they are happy to be contacted by us.
</p>
<p>
    Your friend may contact us
    at <a href="mailto:help@expensify.com">help@expensify.com</a> to request
    that we remove this information from our database.
</p>
<h3>Personal Data Collected by Third Parties</h3>
<p>
    We may receive Personal Data about you from companies that distribute the Expensify Service by way of a co-branded
    or private-labeled website, companies that offer their products and/or services via the Expensify Service, or
    companies that provide services (such as payment processing services) in connection with the Expensify Service
    (collectively, "Partner Companies"). Our Partner Companies may supply us with Personal Data, such as your name and
    email and mailing address information or your login credentials for such Partner Company's website or service, in
    order to help us establish the account or fulfill orders. We may add this information to the information we have
    already collected from you via our website in order to perform and improve the Expensify Service.
</p>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy applies only to the use and disclosure of Personal Data that we collect while you use the
    Expensify Service or the Site. Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your convenience and
    does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents. When you click on such a link,
    you will leave the Expensify Service or our Site and go to another site. During this process, a third party may
    collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible
    for, these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to
    these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on a link to a third party. If you
    submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We
    encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit.
</p>
<h3>Personal Data Collected via Technology</h3>
<p>
    The Expensify Service (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collects Personal Data from you, such
    as browser type, your approximate geographic location of your mobile device or computer (from your Internet Protocol
    (IP) address), operating system and version, Internet Protocol (IP) address, domain name, information about your
    application, operating environment and hardware profiles and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We may also use
    Identifiers (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information
    regarding the date and time of your visit and/or access to the Expensify Service and your activity on the Site and
    the Application. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files
    each time you visit the Site, use the Application or access your account on our network.
</p>
<p>
    When you interact with the Site or the Application, we try to make that experience simple and useful. We use
    industry standard identifiers, such as cookies and mobile device identifiers which perform a similar role, like the
    IDFA used by Apple devices and the UDID used by Android devices. Cookies are small pieces of information which are
    issued to your computer or mobile device (as the case may be) when you visit a website or access or use a mobile
    application and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the Site or Application (as the case
    may be). A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web or Application session and expire when
    you close your browser or exit the Application. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Site
    or Application and will last for longer. We refer to cookies and the mobile device equivalents as "Identifiers".
</p>
<p>We use Identifiers to:</p>
<ul class="bullets marginBottom">
    <li>remember that you have visited us before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive;</li>
    <li>customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the Site or Application;</li>
    <li>
        collect anonymous statistical information about how you use the Site or App (including how long you spend on the Site or Application)
        and where you have come to the Site or Application from, so that we can improve the Site and learn which parts of the Site and which
        functions of the Application are most popular with users; and
    </li>
    <li>
        Our affiliates use Identifiers to monitor performance and usage on the Site and the Application for internal analytics. The use of
        Identifiers by our affiliates is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.
    </li>
    <li>
        Our Site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this
        button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page
        you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media
        Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with
        these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Some of the Identifiers used by the Site are set or accessed (as appropriate) by us, and some a by third parties who
    are delivering services on our behalf.
</p>
<p>
    Most web and mobile device browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to
    prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting
    <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using
    different types of browser or mobile device. Please note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies used on the
    Site or Application, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Site or Application (as the case may be).
</p>
<p>
    In addition to cookies, web beacons may be set by us or third parties in respect of your use of the Site or
    Application. Web beacons are small image files within the content of the Site or Application for analytics purposes
    so we or third parties can understand parts of the Site or Application are visited and which functions of the Site
    or Application are used and whether particular content is of interest.
</p>
<h2>4. USE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>

    render the data personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns so
    that we may enhance the content and functionality of the Expensify Service. Expensify reserves the right to use for
    other purposes and to disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in its discretion.

    Any information, including Personal Data, which you elect to make publicly available on the Expensify Service will

    may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Expensify Service, or if other Members have copied or saved
    that information.

    like to be contacted in conjunction with one of our Corporate Members that use our service, please contact the
    Corporate Members that you interact with directly.

<h2>5. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>
    We may share your Personal Data with Partner Companies to provide technical support or to provide specific services,
    such as hosting of your applications, maintenance services, database management or payment processing for purchases,
    reimbursements or other payments (including but not limited to PayPal and the Bancorp). Partner Companies will have
    access to your Personal Data only to perform these services on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use
    it for any other purpose. They may be located, or their data processing activities may take place, in the United
    States of America or elsewhere outside the European Economic Area (EEA). The US and other non-EEA countries do not
    have similar data protection laws to the European Union, and you should be aware in particular that the law and
    practice in the United States in respect of law enforcement authority access to data is significantly different from
    Europe.
</p>
<p>
    Any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (collectively, "Related
    Entities"), may share some or all of your Personal Data, in which case we will require our Related Entities to honor
    this Privacy Policy and your Personal Data will only be used for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
    Expensify may sell/divest/transfer the company (including any shares in the company), or any combination of its
    products, services, assets and/or businesses. Personal Data may be among the items sold or otherwise transferred in
    these types of transactions, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change
    in ownership or uses of your personal information. We may also sell, assign or otherwise transfer such information
    in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations,
    liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of the company.
</p>
<p>
    Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (if applicable), Expensify may disclose Personal
    Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond
    to subpoenas or warrants or lawful requests from government authorities served on Expensify; or (b) protect or
    defend the rights, reputation or property of Expensify or users of the Expensify Service.
</p>
<p>
    Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do not sell, trade, share, or rent the Personal Data collected from

    We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will

    agreements.
</p>
<h3>Access to Data Controlled by our Corporate Members</h3>
<p>
    Where a Member accesses the Application or the Expensify Service because their employer is a Corporate Member,
    Expensify has no direct relationship with that Member. In that situation, a Member who seeks access, or who seeks to
    correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the Expensify's Corporate Member (the data
    controller). If the Corporate Member requests Expensify to remove the data, we will respond to their request within
    30 business days.
</p>
<h3>Data Retention</h3>
<p>
    Expensify will retain data we process on behalf of our Corporate Members for as long as needed to provide services

    obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

    Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you
    provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your
    personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:help@expensify.com">help@expensify.com</a>.
    In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

<h2>8. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
<p>
    Members who are California residents may request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, certain information
