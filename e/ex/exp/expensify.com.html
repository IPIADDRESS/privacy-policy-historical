    not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
</p>

<p>
    Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint
    ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "Related
    Entities"), we may in the future. We may share some or all of your Personal
    Data with these Related Entities, in which case we will require our Related

</p>
<p>
    Expensify may sell/divest/transfer the company (including any shares in the
    company), or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or
    businesses. Personal Data may be among the items sold or otherwise
    transferred in these types of transactions, you will be notified via email

    acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations,
    similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of the
    company.
</p>
<p>
    Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (if

</p>
<p>
    Where Expensify collects Personal Data directly from EU and/or Swiss data
    subjects, Expensify provides the individuals with a choice regarding the
    manner and circumstances in which the Personal Data will be used and shared

    contractual provisions from the EU or Swiss data controller that the
    Personal Data has been provided to Expensify in accordance with the
    applicable data protection laws to ensure the individuals have been provided
    with appropriate choice regarding how their information may be
    used. Expensify complies with these principles for all Personal Data
    disclosed or transferred to a third party. In the event Expensify utilizes
    data processors to perform tasks on behalf of and/or under the instruction
    of Expensify, Expensify requires such data processors to enter into a
    written agreement with Expensify that requires them to provide the same
    level of protection that Expensify provides.

    will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such
    requirements). We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.
</p>
<p>
    We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as

    enforce our agreements.
</p>
<h3>Access to Data Controlled by our Clients</h3>
<p>
    Expensify has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal
    data it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct,
    amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the Expensify's
    Client (the data controller). If the Client requests Expensify to remove the
    data, we will respond to their request within 30 business days.

<h2>9. SECURITY OF YOUR APPLICATION AND PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>
    Expensify is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data. We
    use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to
    help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or
    disclosure. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card
    number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information
    using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also require you to enter a
    password to access your account information. Please do not disclose your
    account password to unauthorized people. Despite these measures, you should
    know that Expensify cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with
    Personal Data.

<h2>10. STORAGE AND PROCESSING</h2>
<p>
    Your information collected through the Expensify Service may be stored and
    processed in the United States or any other country in which Expensify or
    its affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. Expensify may
    transfer information that we collect about you, including Personal Data, to
    affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your
    country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the
    world. If you are located in the European Union, Switzerland or other
    regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from
    U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including Personal
    Data, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data
    protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of
    information to the U.S. or any other country in which Expensify or its
    parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities
    and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this
    Privacy Policy.
