<strong>Privacy Policy</strong><p></p>

Experience, Inc. ("Experience") is committed to maintaining the privacy of personal 
                              information of users ("you" or "User") of the Experience 
                              eRecruiting Network (the "Experience eRecruiting 
                              Network" or the "Site"). Since we collect certain 
                              types of information about our Users, we want you 
                              to understand the terms and conditions surrounding 
                              the capture and use of that information. This privacy 
                              statement discloses what information we collect, 
                              how we use it and how to correct and change it. 
                              <br>
                              <br>
College and university career centers use the Experience eRecruiting Network to manage student data and automate and web-enable 
their on-campus recruiting programs and other career center functions.  In that connection, career center staff and administrators

in the school's resume book on the Site and to apply for jobs on your behalf.  Your school's career center and the activities and 
practices of its staff and administrators are not subject to this Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for what they do with 
personal information about you which is available or accessible to them on or through the Site.  If you have questions regarding 
the practices and policies of your school's career center with respect to your personal information, we recommend that you contact 
them directly.
<br><br>
We may make content or services from other web sites available to you from links located on the Site. These other web sites are 
not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each such web site to determine how that 
site protects your privacy.
<br><br>
<strong>Personally Identifiable Information We Collect</strong><br>
We receive and collect personally identifiable information about individual Users of our site (such as name, contact information, 
demographic information, academic history, etc.):
<ul>
    <li>From your college or university career center; and </li>
    <li>From you, on a strictly voluntary basis, by specifically requesting it from you (i) when you register on the site, (ii) 
    when you complete or edit your student profile, (iii) when you use or register for certain products and services, (iv) when 
    you respond to surveys or questionnaires, and (v) when you enter or sign up for promotions or contests.</li>
    <li>From you, on a strictly voluntary basis, if and when you choose to upload resumes, cover letters, writing samples and 
    other documents to the Site which contain personal information about you.</li>
</ul>
We may also ask you for other information from time to time, which you may choose to provide or not to provide at your sole 
discretion, such as information regarding your personal experiences, interests and preferences, your views on career related 
topics and other selected issues, your opinion regarding various features of our site, the types of jobs you are interested 
in, etc. In certain instances, personally identifiable information with respect to Users may also be received from one or more 
of our other business partners.
<br><br>
<strong>How We Use Personally Identifiable Information Collected</strong><br>
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose, display or share your personal information to or with third 
parties without your permission.  
<br><br>
We use personally identifying information we collect on the Site for the following purposes:
<ul>
    <li>To enable you to access and utilize the various tools, features and functionality of the Site, such as applying for 
    jobs, creating and using job search agents, uploading documents, publishing resumes to resume books, etc.</li>
    <li>For administering sweepstakes, contests, surveys, questionnaires, polling activities and other similar events and 
    activities that you choose to participate in, and for other purposes specifically communicated to you when we collect the 
    information.</li>
    <li>To communicate with you with regard to your use of the Site and its services or to advise you of Site changes or other 
    events or occurrences which may affect your access to or use of the Site.</li>
</ul>
                              <p>If you choose to publish your resume or any other document containing personal 
                                information in a resume book or to participate 
                                in the Experience Network, your personal profile 
                                information and resume will be searchable by and 
                                accessible to employers who have access to those 
                                databases. While we endeavor to restrict access 
                                to these databases to eligible employers, we cannot 
                                guarantee that other parties will not, without 
                                our consent, gain access to these databases as 
                                well. You may remove your resume from a resume 
                                book or opt out of the Experience Network at any 
                                time. However, employers and recruiters who have 
                                access to these databases, and other parties who 
                                have otherwise gained access to these databases, 
                                may have retained a copy of your resume in their 
                                own files or databases. We are not responsible 
                                for the retention, use or privacy of resumes in 
                                these instances, or for the use or privacy of 
                                resumes or other personal information of Users 
                                by any of such parties while such resumes or personal 
                                information are in resume books or the Experience 
                                Network. <br>
                                <br>
                                With your permission, we may use your e-mail address 
                                and other contact information to send you articles, 
                                profiles, industry news and other career related 
                                information, as well as to notify you of special 
                                promotions or additional products and services 
                                offered by us or our business partners that may 
                                be of interest to you. With your permission, we 
                                may also share your personal information with 
                                our business partners and other third parties 
                                to enable them to contact you regarding special 
                                promotions, products and services they offer which 
                                may be of interest to you. You have the ability 
                                to opt-out of these types of communications at 
                                any time (see "Opt-in/Opt-out Policy" below). 
                                <br>
                              </p>
                              <p>We typically use third-party email delivery services. 
                                These third parties may embed HTML and link detectors 
                                in our email transmissions to assess the effectiveness 
                                of our email communications. The detectors track 
                                recipients' capability of receiving HTML messages 
                                and the aggregate number of HTML messages opened. 
                                The detectors also track the links that recipients 
                                click on within the email. The detectors do not 
                                collect any other information.<br>
                                <br>
                                We use third-party advertising companies to serve 
                                ads when you visit our Site. These companies may 
                                use information (not including your name, address 
                                email address or telephone number) about your 
                                visits to this and other web sites in order to 
                                provide advertisements about goods and services 
                                of interest to you. If you would like more information 
                                about this practice and to know your choices about 
                                not having this information used by these companies,

                                We employ other companies and individuals to perform 
                                functions on our behalf. Examples may include 
                                hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing 
                                marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, 
                                and providing customer service. These other companies 
                                will have access to your personal information 
                                as necessary to perform their functions, but they 
                                are required to maintain the confidentiality of

                                <br>
                                From time to time, we may also disclose personally 
                                identifiable information to fulfill certain legal 
                                and regulatory requirements or if we believe, 
                                in good faith, that such disclosure is legally

                                or acquired, personally identifiable information

                                All Users should be aware that when they voluntarily

                                can be collected and used by others. This may

                                such party's use of your personal information.
