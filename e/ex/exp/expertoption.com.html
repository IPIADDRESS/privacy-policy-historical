    Cookies Definition: A&nbsp;cookie is&nbsp;a&nbsp;some set of&nbsp;data that
    often includes a&nbsp;unique identifier that is&nbsp;sent to&nbsp;Client’s
    computer or&nbsp;mobile phone (referred to&nbsp;here as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“device”
    browser from a&nbsp;website’s computer and is&nbsp;stored on&nbsp;Client’s
    device’s hard drive for tracking site usage. A&nbsp;website may send its own
    cookie to&nbsp;Client’s browser if&nbsp;Client’s browser’s preferences
    allow&nbsp;it, but, to&nbsp;protect Client’s privacy, Client’s browser only
    permits a&nbsp;website to&nbsp;access the cookies it&nbsp;has already sent
    to&nbsp;Client, not the cookies sent to&nbsp;Client by&nbsp;other websites.
    Many websites do&nbsp;this whenever a&nbsp;user visits their website
    in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;track online traffic flows. A&nbsp;Client may choose
    to&nbsp;configure their browser to&nbsp;reject cookies by&nbsp;modifying
    their browser settings or&nbsp;preferences.
  </li>
  <li>
    Company’s cookies policy: During the course of&nbsp;any Client’s visit
    to&nbsp;the Site, the pages viewed, along with a&nbsp;cookie are downloaded
    to&nbsp;the Client’s device hard drive, into Company’s local storage, and
    also into the cache memory of&nbsp;the devices and applications used
    by&nbsp;Client. Cookies stored may determine the path Client took
    on&nbsp;the Site and used to&nbsp;anonymously identify repeat users
    of&nbsp;the Site and what pages were most popular for Company’s clients.
    However, Company protects the Client’s privacy by&nbsp;not storing the
    Client’s names, personal details, emails, etc. Stored cookies allow the Site
    to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more user-friendly and efficient for Clients
    by&nbsp;allowing Company to&nbsp;inspect what information is&nbsp;more
    valued by&nbsp;Clients versus what isn’t.
