	<br>
	Expedia.co.uk collects personally identifiable information 
	("PII") about you that you specifically and voluntarily 
	provide. PII includes information that can identify 
	you as a specific individual, such as your name, phone 
	number, or e-mail address. Although you are required 
	to register as a member of Expedia.co.uk in order to 
	use selected travel planning tools, and some PII is 
	needed in order to process and fulfill travel requests, 
	many areas of Expedia.co.uk can be accessed without 
	providing any PII.
	</p><p>
	On all Expedia.co.uk pages that collect PII, we specifically 
	describe what information is required in order to provide 
	you with the product or service you have requested.
	</p><p>
	At present, Expedia, Inc. centralises its records of 
	PII for all Expedia operations, including Expedia.co.uk, 
	in the United States. As a consequence Expedia, Inc. 
	may perform some of its data processing of your PII 
	outside of the United Kingdom, for example in the United 
	States. To do this, Expedia, Inc. may transfer your 
	PII internationally to other countries including the 
	United States. Some of the countries may have laws 
	that protect your PII, some may not. Expedia, Inc. 
	will protect your PII no matter where we process or 
	store your data by following this privacy statement. 
	By becoming a member of Expedia.co.uk you give your 
	consent to this transfer of your PII.
	<br>
	</p><p>
	Expedia.co.uk collects PII when you:
	</p><ul>
		<li>
		Become an Expedia.co.uk member
		</li><li>
		Complete a traveller profile
		</li><li>
		Purchase travel
		</li><li>
		Use the Travel Arranger service
		</li><li>
		Participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes
		</li><li>
		Contact Expedia.co.uk</li>
		 
	</ul><b>Member information</b>
	<br>
	Expedia.co.uk collects your Member ID, password, and 
	e-mail address when you register to become a member 
	of our Web site.
	<p><b>Traveller profile information</b>
	<br>
	Expedia.co.uk collects the full name and contact number 
	for a traveller when a travel reservation is made. 
	We may also collect information about each traveller's 
	preferences, including meal requests, seat selection, 
	frequent flyer/hotel/car hire programmes and membership 
	numbers, and ticketing options. This information is 
	stored in the 
	<a href="/pub/agent.dll?qscr=info">
		My Profile
	</a>
	area of a member's Expedia.co.uk account.
	</p><p>
	When someone other than yourself is accompanying you 
	on travel purchased through Expedia.co.uk, we may collect 
	PII and travel preferences about that individual. You 
	should obtain the consent of other individuals prior 
	to providing Expedia.co.uk with their full names, contact 
	numbers, and travel preferences, as they will be unable 
	to directly access our systems to view or change any 
	information you provide on their behalf.
	</p><p><b>Travel purchase information</b>
	<br>
	Expedia.co.uk collects the billing address of the credit 
	card that is used to purchase travel. We will also 
	collect credit card information, including card number,

	</p><p><b>Travel Arranger information</b>
	<br>
	Expedia.co.uk offers you the ability to authorise others 
	to make and purchase travel arrangements on your behalf 
	and allows you to become an authorised Travel Arranger 
	for other Expedia.co.uk members. If you elect to participate 
	in this service, Expedia.co.uk will collect the e-mail 
	address of the person you are authorising to make travel 
	arrangements on your behalf or for whom you are requesting 
	authorisation to make travel arrangements.
	</p><p><b>Surveys, contests, and sweepstakes information</b>
	<br>
	Occasionally, Expedia.co.uk may offer our members and 
	site visitors an opportunity to participate in a survey, 
	contest, or sweepstakes. Information collected by Expedia.co.uk 
	when you participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes 
	may include your full name, e-mail address, and street 
	address.
	</p><p><b>Contacting Expedia.co.uk</b>
	<br>
	Expedia.co.uk collects PII such as your full name, 
	Member ID, e-mail address, and/or contact number whenever 
	you submit a question or suggestion, or request assistance 
	with viewing your itinerary, logging on to Expedia.co.uk, 
	or accessing your account.
	</p><p><b>Our partners</b>
	<br>
	Expedia.co.uk has partnered with reputable third parties 
	to offer our members and site visitors a variety of 
	products and services. All travel services throughout 
	Expedia.co.uk that are provided by a third-party partner 
	are described as such. Although we only work with reputable 
	third parties, our business partners may have different 
	privacy policies and practices than Expedia.co.uk. 
	We encourage you to review our business partners' privacy 
	policies to further understand their procedures for 
	collecting, using, and disclosing your information.
