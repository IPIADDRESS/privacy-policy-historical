I am completely familiar with the standards held in my community, and the material I expect to access in this site falls within these standards. In my experience, the average adult in my community accepts the consumption of such materials by willing adults in circumstances such as this, which offer reasonable insulation from the materials for minors, and unwilling adults.

If you do not agree to all parts of this privacy policy, please cease use of this site or any parts thereof immediately. Further, do not submit any personal data, or email us, or fill out contact forms. <br> This page is used to inform website visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information. Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified by, and it does not include data that has been anonymized or pseudonymized. <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We also address GDPR specific issues such as data retention, deletion requests, what data we and our third party partners gather, and more.

<p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at https://exploitedcollegegirls.com/free/terms.html, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) states that personal data should be collected, processed, and retained for no longer than is necessary for the purpose it was obtained for. When we mention any retention periods in this document below, it refers to retention of data from EU subjects only. Please carefully read below what data we collect directly, and what data third party services collect on our behalf, in particular billing companies. For third party data collection, we provide a general overview of their data gathering and use practices, but we can't guarantee this overview is comprehensive. To find out the full extend of their data gathering, storage, and retention practice, please contact each third party service directly. <br> This policy does not apply to information collected by us offline or through other means such as any other website operated by us, or any third party or affiliates.</p>
<h2>Log Data</h2>
<p>Like almost every other web site, we automatically collect information that your browser sends to us, which is called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser version, pages of this site you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, the site or URL you were on before you came to this site, and other statistics, depending on your browser and the server software. This information is automatically captured by servers, even if you do not become a paying member or otherwise interact with the site. Merely by visiting this site, the servers capture this data and stores it for up to 30 days, longer if required by law. This information is needed to investigate or prevent any hacking or other illegal activities, provide customer service, help us learn how, why, when, and where visitors use this site or portions thereof, and help us allocate the necessary resources to ensure a smooth experience for our members. <br>This information is stored on the server in log files, which are accessible by the hosting company , as well as the webmaster and support agents of this site via a password protected administration interface on the server.</p>
<h2>Transaction and Financial Data</h2>
<p>If you become a paying member of this site, additional information will be obtained (“Transaction/Financial Data”) about you, most of which you voluntarily agree to provide, but some may be obtained without your explicit input. During the payment process, a third party payment process ("Biller") will require you to input your name, address, credit card or bank account data, zip code, email address, and other personally identifiable information. They may also automatically capture your IP address and browser information without your input. Exactly what data a Biller captures and what they do with it and for how long depends on the Biller, and you need to contact the Biller's sites to find out more. Please scroll down to the Third Party section for more detailed information, including GDPR-related rights if you are located in the EU, such as what data is used, by whom, and how to request deletion, etc. <br> This site does not itself host your credit card data, but it does receive your user name and encrypted password and IP address, which are stored in a database. This is required in order for you to be able to log in to the site. Further, the site may obtain any other information you provided to the Billers such as your full name, address, referring URL (the URL that referred you this site, which, if it is a URL or website operated by an affiliate of this site, will be paid for this referral), and IP address, which will be stored in a separate secure database.<br> All information described above will generally remain in the site's databases or Biller's system indefinitely or until you request deletion of that data, however the actual retention time varies by Biller. Remember that in order for you to be able to log in or receive any support or services, we must have this information.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>

These are sent to your browser from the website that you visit and are stored on your computer’s hard drive.<br> Our website uses these "cookies" to collection information and to improve our Service. You do not have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies. Merely by visiting this site, cookies will be stored on your computer. You can delete these cookies at any time by going into your browser settings and deleting them. If you choose to refuse our cookies , you may not be able to use some portions of our Service. If you become a paying member and wish to log in to the members area, you must have cookies enabled for the duration of your visit to the members area. You are welcome to delete the cookies from your browser after your visit , but this may make logging in later less convenient for you.</p>
<p>If you contact us via any of our contact forms, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to your name, user name (if a member) and email address. Further, our forms automatically collect your IP address. The information that we collect will be used to contact or identify you, and we may try to match this information with data our billing companies have stored about you in order to verify your membership, location, or in order to assist with any technical or other issues you may have contacted us or the billing companies about. All submissions whether via a contact form or email can be accessed by the webmaster of this site, and its owners, and its designated third parties such as our third party technical support service. When you submit a form you also give us permission to share this information with the hosting company, Biller, customer support agent, and third party marketing service in order for us to investigate fraud, provide customer or technical service, investigate technical issues such as download or streaming video problems, and to offer additional products and services via email campaigns. You can opt out of any email campaigns at any time by clicking the Unsubscribe link on the bottom of any marketing email we or our designated third party email marketing services provider send to you. Our contact forms are provided by a third party service called JotForm.com, and you can read about how we use their service in the Third Party Service Providers section below.</p>
<h2>Third Party Service Providers</h2>
<p>We employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide billing services for memberships;</li>
<li>To facilitate the log-in and authentication process for members.</li>
<li>To provide customer or technical support;</li>

We also employ tracking services from Google Analytics and Hotjar, but this data does not include your name, address, or other personal data, with exception of your IP address in the case of Hotjar, and limited browser data such as type and version number. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf, which is detailed below. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose unless required by law. Each third party in turn has their own storage and retention policies. We are not always able to delete your information on your behalf, and you will need to contact each third party service directly should you wish to have them delete your information.</p>

<h2>International Data Transfer</h2>
<p>This site is hosted in the United States. If you are located in a non-US jurisdiction, for example in the European Economic Area ("EEA") / European Union ("EU"), you agree that the provision of personal data or other access or use of this site constitutes your consent to the transfer of such data/information, including personal data, to the United States, a jurisdiction that may or may not provide the same level of data protection compared to the laws in your home country.Security</p>
<p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. The servers this site is hosted on are monitored 24/7 and are scanned daily for malware and viruses. Further, we employ various proprietary and open source technologies to prevent hackers or malicious scripts from accessing restricted server areas, including but not limited to any of your personal information that may be stored. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security</p>
<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>Our Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 18, 21 in some jurisdictions. We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from persons under 18. In case we discover that a person under 18 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately so that we can take necessary actions as soon as possible. We employ the RTA (“Restricted To Adults”) label on our site in order for parents to make it easier to block our site. You can learn more about this at http://rtalabel.org</p>
<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page.</p>
<h2>GDPR Rights – Additional Granular Information</h2>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) offers changes to data privacy for any person or company located in the European Union. The purpose is to give subjects greater control over their personal information, including the right to actively consent to every use of personal data and the right to limit that use, as well as “the right to be forgotten”, the right to have their data portable, and the right to seek damages should they suffer from misuse/breach of their data.</p>
<p>As you can see by reading our privacy policy, this site itself only keeps very little personally identifiable data about you, in particular if you only visit the site but don't purchase a membership or use any contact form. The bulk of data is stored by our third parties such as the billing companies, which captures and stores this information from you if you purchase a membership, only some of which they will send to us (user name, encrypted password) - and this is necessary in order for you to have an active membership. When you submit a request to have your data deleted, we will begin deleting your data from servers and systems we have direct control over, and inform third parties such as the billing companies of your request as well. However, it may often be faster and more thorough for you to contact a billing company directly to have them delete your data.</p>
<p>If you are an EU resident and wish to have your data deleted, <a title="GDPR Form" href="https://form.jotform.com/81440772785161" target="_blank">fill out this form</a> or email privacy@exploitedcollegegirls.com with your full name, IP address, and email address you used to sign up or otherwise interact with this site. Please note that once we delete all your data, this will include data you provide via the contact form or email. Therefore we cannot contact you to let you know that this data has been deleted.</p>
<p>If you wish to obtain any personally identifiable data we have of you in an electronically portable format, you may request that at no cost <a title="GDPR Form" href="https://form.jotform.com/81440772785161" target="_blank">here</a>. You will receive a spreadsheet or text document with any information we have as soon as possible. <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Note:</strong> we do not respond to requests for deletion or portable data or any other GDPR-related requests from anyone located outside the EU, or otherwise not covered by GDPR. </span>Further, we are not obligated to restrict retention of any data of persons not located in the EU or covered by GDPR, and we reserve the right to keep such data for any period we deem necessary, prudent, and lawful.</p>
<h2>Do Not Track Policy</h2>
<p>Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference users can set in most browsers. How you do this depends on your browser. It is not legally required for a site or service to honor this request, and many sites, such as ours, don't have the ability to recognize or respond to any DNT requests. In other words, DNT does not work on this site.</p>
<h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>California Civil Code permits users of this site who are California residents to request certain information about the site's disclosure of personal information to third parties for the purpose of direct marketing. You can email privacy@exploitedcollegegirls.com to make this request, and to opt-out from disclosure of your information to third parties for marketing purposes. (California residents only). <br>This affects marketing ONLY. You may still receive relevant account or billing information, or other select offers from the site in accordance with California law.</p>
<h2>Legal successor</h2>
<p>In the event this sites undergoes a merger, restructuring, buyout, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation, or other sale or transfer of any or all assets, any personal information held by this site may be among the assets transferred or sold.
