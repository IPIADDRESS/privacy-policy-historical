When someone visits the Site, our web servers automatically gather information that allows the site to communicate with the visitor's computer during the visit.

Privacy concerns focus on Personal Information, that is, information that could identify a specific individual such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers. If during your visit you personalize the Site, complete an order form, enter a contest, or submit other information to us, you may provide us with Personal Information.

This technology will not process any information that can be used to personally identify you, that is it will not include your name, address, or other personal information.
