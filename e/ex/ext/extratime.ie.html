<h2>ExtraTime -  PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<br>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>We at ExtraTime.ie respect your right to privacy and comply with our obligations under the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2002. The purpose of this Website Privacy Policy is to outline how we deal with any personal data you provide to us while visiting this website. Naturally, if you are not happy with this Website Privacy Policy you should not use this website.</p>

<h2>2. Types of Information Collected</h2>


<p>We retain two types of information:</p>
<ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>"Non-Personal Data"</p>
<p>Like most websites, we gather statistical and other analytical information collected on an aggregate basis of all visitors to our website. This Non-Personal Data comprises information that cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information regarding, for example, user IP addresses where they have been clipped or anonymised, browser types and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our website.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Purposes for which we hold your Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Non-Personal Data:</p>
