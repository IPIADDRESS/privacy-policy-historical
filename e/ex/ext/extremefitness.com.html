              individual user (such as, for example, your full name, street address, 
              telephone number, credit card number or e-mail address) to any third 
              party without having received your permission. We may request personal 
              identification information from you in connection with your use 
              of, or participation in, our contests, sweepstakes, games, surveys, 
              forums, subscription registrations, content submissions, chats,

              collect personal identification information from you only if you 
              voluntarily submit such information to us.<br>

              <br>
              If you do provide us with personal information, we may use it to 
              conduct the activities described above. If you identify yourself 
              to us by sending us an e-mail with questions or comments, we may 
              use your personal information to respond to your questions or comments. 
              We may file your comments for future reference, or we may discard 
              the information after we have reviewed it.<br>

              ExtremeFitness Sites' Terms and Conditions and this Privacy 
              Policy. <br>
              <br>
              If you give us your permission, we may also use personal identification 
              information for internal or external marketing and promotional purposes. 
              On occasion, for example, we may send you e-mails to introduce a 
              product or service that we think might be of interest to the users 
              of our sites. For us to obtain your permission to send you this 
              information, we will give you an opportunity to "opt-in" at the 
              time our request for your personal information is made. If you do 
              "opt-in," you may choose to "opt-out" at any time, even after you 
              have provided personal information, by following the procedures 
              set forth below at the end of this Privacy Policy. Please note, 
              however, that under certain circumstances, if you initially do not 
              choose to "opt-in," or if you later "opt-out," you may not be eligible 
              for certain benefits for which a name, e-mail address, telephone 
              number or other personal identification information is needed.<br>
              <br>

              We have the following exceptions to these policies: We will release 
              specific information about you or your account to comply with any 
              valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute 
              or court order. We will also release specific information in special 
              cases, such as if there is an attempted breach of the security of 
              the ExtremeFitness Sites, or a physical threat to you 
              or others.<br>
              <br>
              Please note that if you give out personal information online -- 
              for example, through a message board or chat room -- that information 
              can be collected and used by third parties. Although we strive to

            <h4><a name="dmca_policy" id="dmca_policy"></a>Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy</h4>
            <p>ExtremeFitness.Com is an Online Service Provider under Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Section 512 ("DMCA"). ExtremeFitness.Com respects the legitimate rights of copyrights owners, and has adopted an efficient notice and takedown procedure as required by the DMCA and described herein. This policy is intended to guide copyright owners in utilizing that procedure, and also to guide webmasters in restoring access to websites that are disabled due to mistake. </p>
            <h4><a name="owners_notice" id="owners_notice"></a>Notice to Owners of Copyrighted Works</h4>
            <p>The DMCA provides a legal procedure by which you can request any Online Service Provider to disable access to a website where your copyrighted work(s) are appearing without your permission. There are two parts to the legal procedure: (1) Writing a Proper DMCA Notice, and (2) Sending the Proper DMCA Notice to ExtremeFitness.Com Designated Agent. </p>
            <h4><a name="writing_notice" id="writing_notice"></a>How to Write a Proper DMCA Notice</h4>
            <p>A Proper DMCA Notice will notify ExtremeFitness.Com of particular facts in a document signed under penalty of perjury. We refer to this as a “Proper DMCA Notice.” To Write a Proper DMCA notice, please provide the following information:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Identify yourself as either:
                  <ol type="a">
                    <li>The owner of a copyrighted work(s), or</li>
                    <li>A person “authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.”</li>
                  </ol>
              </li>
              <li> State your contact information, including your TRUE NAME, street address, telephone number, and email address.</li>
              <li> Identify the copyrighted work that you believe is being infringed, or if a large number of works are appearing at a single website, a representative list of the works.</li>
              <li> Identify the material that you claim is infringing your copyrighted work, to which you are requesting that ExtremeFitness.Com disable access over the World Wide Web.</li>
              <li> Identify the location of the material on the World Wide Web by providing “information reasonably sufficient to permit ExtremeFitness.Com to locate the material.”</li>
              <li> State that you have “a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agents, or the law.”</li>
              <li> State that the information in the notice is accurate, under penalty of perjury.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Sign the notice with either a physical or electronic signature. </p>
            <h4><a name="sending_notice" id="sending_notice"></a>Sending The Proper DMCA Notice to the Designated Agent</h4>
            <p>To exercise your DMCA rights, you must send your Proper DMCA Notice to the following agent designated by ExtremeFitness.Com (the “Designated Agent”.) The contact information for ExtremeFitness.Com's Designated Agent is:</p>
            <p>Address: 14001-C Saint Germain Drive, PMB 165 Centreville, VA 20121-2338</p>
            <p>Email: <a href="mailto:webmaster@extremefitness.com">webmaster@extremefitness.com</a></p>
            <p></p>
            <h4><a name="receiving_notice" id="receiving_notice"></a>What We Do When We Receive A Proper DMCA Notice</h4>
            <p>ExtremeFitness.Com will follow the procedures provided in the DCMA, which prescribed a notice and takedown procedure, subject to the webmaster’s right to submit a Counter-notification claiming lawful use of the disabled works. </p>
            <h4><a name="takedown_procedure" id="takedown_procedure"></a>Notice and Takedown Procedure</h4>
            <p>It is expected that all users of any part of the ExtremeFitness.Com system will comply with applicable copyright laws. However, if ExtremeFitness.Com is notified of claimed copyright infringement, or otherwise becomes aware of facts and circumstances from which infringement is apparent, it will respond expeditiously by removing, or disabling access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity. ExtremeFitness.Com will comply with the appropriate provisions of the DMCA in the event a counter notification is received by its Designated Agent. </p>
            <h4><a name="yousendit_notice" id="yousendit_notice"></a>Notice to Users of ExtremeFitness.Com Systems</h4>
            <p>Pursuant to the Terms of Service Agreement you agreed to when you were permitted to become a System User, you are required to use only lawfully-acquired creative works as website content, and your website may be disabled upon receipt of notice that infringing material is appearing there. ExtremeFitness.Com also respects the legitimate interests of webmasters in utilizing media content lawfully, being permitted to present a response to claims of infringement, and obtaining timely restoration of access to a website that has been disabled due to a copyright complaint.</p>
            <p> Your System Use privileges can also be suspended. You may protest a DMCA notice by submitting a Counter-notification as described below. </p>
            <h4><a name="submitting_counter_notification" id="submitting_counter_notification"></a>Writing and Submitting a Counter-notification</h4>
            <p>If access to your website is disabled due to operation of the ExtremeFitness.Com notice and takedown procedure described above, and you believe the takedown was improper, you must submit a Counter-notification. </p>
            <h4><a name="writing_counter_notification" id="writing_counter_notification"></a>Writing a Counter-notification</h4>
            <p>To Write a Proper Counter-notification, please provide the following information:</p>
            <ol>
              <li> State that access to your website was disabled due to operation of the notice and takedown procedure.</li>
              <li> Identify the material that has been removed and designate its URL prior to removal.</li>
              <li> State, under penalty of perjury:
                  <ol type="a">
                    <li>Your name, address, and telephone number,</li>
                    <li> That you “have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as result of mistake or misidentification of the material,"</li>
                    <li> That you “consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located."</li>
                  </ol>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p></p>
            <h4><a name="sending_counter_notification" id="sending_counter_notification"></a>Sending the Counter-notification</h4>
            <p>To exercise your DMCA rights, you must send your Counter-notification to the “Designated Agent” for ExtremeFitness.Com, whose contact information is:</p>
            <p>Address: 14001-C Saint Germain Drive, PMB 165 Centreville, VA 20121-2338</p>
            <p>Email: <a href="mailto:webmaster@extremefitness.com">webmaster@extremefitness.com</a></p>
            <p></p>
            <h4><a name="repeat_infringers" id="repeat_infringers"></a>Repeat Infringers</h4>
            <p>ExtremeFitness.Com may, in its discretion, use all appropriate means to terminate user access to its system or network who are repeat infringers. </p>
            <h4><a name="technical_measures" id="technical_measures"></a>Accommodation of Standard Technical Measures</h4>
            <p>It is ExtremeFitness.Com's policy to accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures it determines are reasonable under the circumstances, i.e., technical measures that are used by copyright owners to identify or protect copyrighted works. </p>
            <h4><a name="non_compliant_communications" id="non_compliant_communications"></a>Policy With Regard To Non-Compliant Communications</h4>
            <p>ExtremeFitness.Com has discretion to handle non-compliant notices in whatever manner appears to be reasonable given the circumstances presented. </p>
            <h4><a name="misleading_information" id="misleading_information"></a>Submission of Misleading Information</h4>
            <p>The submission of misleading information of any sort in a notification or counter-notification submitted to ExtremeFitness.Com voids any claim of right made by the submitting party. </p>            </td>
