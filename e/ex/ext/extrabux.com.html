<h2>WHO SEES YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

<p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy notice. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>

<p>Only a very limited number of our employees ever have access to your personal information. We may use third-party contractors or vendors to help us provide some of our services. If we need to disclose personal information for them to provide the services, it is with the requirement that the information will be kept confidential and used only to provide those services. In addition, our affiliates, subsidiaries, service providers, and other entities may collect personal information about your browsing habits over time and across different Web sites when you use our website.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us or to protect us and our members from losses.</p>

<p>While browsers allow you to disable the usage of cookies, we do not change our practices in response to a “Do Not Track” signal in the http header from your browser or mobile application.</p>

<h2>COOKIES</h2>

<p>We may place "cookies" on your personal computer. "Cookies" are small identifiers, sent from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive, that help us to recognize you if you visit our website again. Extrabux uses these cookies to determine whether or not you made a purchase at one of our retailer sites. Also, our site uses cookies to track how you found our site. Cookies are not used to get data from your hard drive, your e-mail or any other personal data about you. To protect your privacy we do not use cookies to store or transmit any personal information about you on the Internet. You can reject cookies by changing your browser settings.

It is also possible that some web pages may not properly load, your access to certain information might be denied, or you might have to enter information about yourself more than once.</p>

<h2>SECURITY</h2>

<p>We safeguard your personal data during electronic transmission from you to us using known encryption, security standards and procedures. We restrict access to non-public personal information about you only to those employees who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and other procedural safeguards to comply with applicable privacy laws to guard your nonpublic personal information. We also assess new technology for protecting sensitive customer information on an ongoing basis. However, if your information is forwarded to a third party provider, your information will be transmitted according to the security and privacy policies of that third party provider whose privacy practices may differ from ours. Your information as shared with outside providers will become subject to those different privacy policies.</p>

<p>Due to federal and state regulations, we are required to keep a copy of your information for a period of three (3) years. Over this period, we will maintain all such data in a confidential and secure area that third parties will not be allowed to access.</p>
