  identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services 
  or otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also may collect 
  certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web 
  pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), 
  the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows '95 or Mac OS) and 
  the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>How We 
  Use the Information</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We may use the 
  information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, 
  programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and 
  to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of 
  interest to you.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We sometimes use 
  this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have 
  won one of our contests or when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, 
  to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about 
  your account with us.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We use the information 
  that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards. 
  From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs, 
  or services to them.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The information 
  we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide 
  an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation 
  in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you 
  products, programs, or services.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you choose to 
  submit content for publication (e.g., a "letter to our editors"), 
  we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We sometimes use 
  the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design

  well as to offer you products, programs, or services.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will disclose 
  information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response 
  to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response 
  to a law enforcement agency's request.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Agents and contractors 
  of Latitude3 Media who have access to personally identifiable information are 
  required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this 
  Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other 
  than to carry out the services they are performing for Latitude3 Media.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although we take 
  appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, 
  we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect 
  will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. 
  Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent 
  their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information 
  about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If a Latitude3 
  Media site discloses personally identifiable information to companies not owned 
  by Latitude3 Media who want to market products or services to you, it will provide 
  you with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses. For instructions on how 
  to opt out from such disclosures, please </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="mailto:privacy@latitude3.com">privacy@latitude3.com</a></font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Latitude3 Media 
  may on occasion combine information we receive online with outside records to 
  enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that may be 
  of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive marketing information from 
  this site, privacy@latitude3.com</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, Latitude3 
  Media sites will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided
