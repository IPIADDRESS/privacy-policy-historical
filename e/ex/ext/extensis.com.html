<h2>Extensis and your privacy</h2>
<p>The policies below are applicable to the www.extensis.com  website (“Website”) produced and maintained by Celartem, Inc. d.b.a. Extensis  (collectively “Extensis” or “we”, “us”, or “our”).&nbsp; We have established this privacy policy  (“Privacy Policy”) to let you know the kinds of personal information we may  gather during your visit to the Website, why we gather your information, what  we use your personal information for, when we might disclose your personal  information, and how you can manage your personal information.&nbsp; At Extensis we respect your right to privacy  and we understand that, as a visitor to Extensis.com, you prefer to control  your own personal information and preferences.&nbsp;  For this reason, we will explain to you why we are collecting your  information and ask your permission to use your personal information wherever  we ask you&nbsp; to register or to provide  personal information and preferences when you visit certain areas of  Extensis.com, download free software, request information, or subscribe to  Extensis newsletters.</p>
<p> Please be advised that the practices  described in this Privacy Policy apply only to information gathered online at  our website. It does not apply to information that you may submit to websites  maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link.</p>
<p> By visiting our  Website, you are accepting the practices described in our Privacy Policy.&nbsp; If you do not agree to the terms of this  Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website.&nbsp;  We reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of our Privacy Policy  from time to time without notice. Your continued use of our Website and our  affiliate sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you  accept those changes.&nbsp; If we intend to  apply the modifications or amendments to this Privacy Policy retroactively, we  will provide you with notice of the modifications or amendments.&nbsp; If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or don’t see your concerns addressed here, you should contact  us by email at <u><a href="mailto:info@extensis.com">info@extensis.com</a></u>. </p>
<p>We will use reasonable efforts to protect the personal  information you share with us to ensure the content, services, and advertising  that we provide on Extensis.com are tailored to your current, designated  preferences.</p>
<p> When you provide Extensis with your name (or alias),  e-mail address, mailing address, or telephone number, however you provide that  information to Extensis, including as part of setting up an account, making a  purchase or as part of a customer services or help desk request, we will ask  you to 
  permit Extensis representatives and affiliates to use the provided information  for various purposes, including to alert you to product upgrades, special  offers, updated information, classes, new services, and other Extensis  information. Extensis representatives and affiliates may include value-added  resellers and authorized training partners. Beyond providing information to  Extensis representatives and affiliates, Extensis does not offer or allow the  selling of any user-provided information to third parties.</p>
<p>Separately, we send product update notifications via  email to provide updates and technical notices. These messages are essential to  the functionality of your product. Therefore there is no opt-out available for  update notifications and these messages cannot be blocked.&nbsp; If you do not permit Extensis to use your  information in any other manner, Extensis will only use this personal  information for these purposes.</p>
<p> In addition, when you interact with the Website, our  servers may keep an activity log that does not identify you individually  (“Anonymous Information”). Generally, this information is collected though  “traffic data”. We collect and store certain administrative and traffic  information with each use of the service or Website including: source IP  address, time of access, date of access, web page(s), software crash reports,  type of browser used, session identification number, search terms, search  results, access times and referring websites addresses.&nbsp; <br>
Extensis respects the rights you give us when opting  to receive e-mail communications and enforces internal policies to preserve  those rights. It is our objective to retain the long-term ability to continue  to communicate with our users.</p>
<p> If you do not want Extensis or Extensis  representatives to contact you, you may always change your mind about how you  want to interact with Extensis. As part of your preference flexibility, you'll  always have the option to opt back in or opt back out and have Extensis contact  you based on your previous or new preferences. For instructions, please see the  section "Contact Us," below.</p>
<p>If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can  still visit most Extensis websites; however, you will not have access to areas  that require personal identification. </p>
<div class="hRule"><hr></div>

<h2>Extensis membership and the use of log files (cookies)</h2>
<p>Extensis offers free membership to all Extensis.com  visitors. In order to establish membership, visitors are requested to provide  both personal information and preferences. This information is stored and  protected by your user-established Member ID and Password.&nbsp; As part of your membership, you promise to:  (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and  your business as prompted by the Website's registration form (such information  being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update  the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you  provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete,  or Extensis has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue,  inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Extensis has the right to suspend or  terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the  Website (or any portion thereof).&nbsp; You  are entirely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password  and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all  activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify us of  any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security of which  you become aware. You are responsible for taking precautions and providing  security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the  Services and Website.&nbsp; Please note that  anyone able to provide your personally identifiable information will be able to  access your account so you should take reasonable steps to protect this  information.</p>
<p>There is an additional "Remember me" option. By selecting it,  you allow Extensis to store your Member ID and password so you can access  certain areas of the website without re-signing in. The sign-in information is  stored until you explicitly sign out. It also allows you to return to any  Extensis website on subsequent visits without having to re-enter your  information. Extensis remembers you by placing a log file (cookie) that contains  only enough information to identify you upon return visits. A  "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your web browser  for record-keeping purposes and helps Extensis provide better service to you.  Your browser has options to accept, reject, or provide you with notice when a  cookie is sent.
  No information, other than that found in the Membership cookie, will be  accessed by any Extensis system. Access to your membership information always  requires both your Member ID and Password.</p>
<p> Extensis also utilizes visitor log files (cookies) and hosted tracking with our  website. Once a user enters our site, a cookie follows them through their click  stream path. Examples of information being collected by these cookies and the  hosted tracking include the number of times a user came to our site(s), and the  paths they took to get there. Extensis uses the data collected from website  visitor cookies and hosted tracking in aggregate form only and does not collect  any personally identifiable information. Use of this information helps us  better understand what users are seeking and learning at our website(s) and  helps us identify potential navigation issues.</p>

<div class="hRule"><hr></div>
<h2>How Extensis will protect your personal information</h2>
<p>Your personal information that has been offered to Extensis,  Inc. has been done through an encrypted format, to prevent loss, misuse or  alteration of the data. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet  can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect  your personal information, Extensis, Inc. cannot ensure or warrant the security  of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services,  and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our  best effort to ensure its security on our systems.</p>
<p>Extensis will always protect the personal information that  you share with us. Extensis stores information internally in a controlled,  secure environment. If, for example, you make a purchase online, we route all  transactions through SSL (Secure Socket Layers) and will process your credit  card number only to secure your current payment. The SSL transaction does not  retain your credit card number subsequent to the transaction at hand and will  not use the number for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited  services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases,  answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail  and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the  information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from  using that information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>If Extensis requests general demographic information, this  information is limited to reporting purposes only; members remain anonymous.  Phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and postal addresses are never shared for  demographic reports with outside entities. Extensis may occasionally present a  special contest or promotion that is sponsored by another company. To qualify  for entry, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share  that information with the sponsor(s), we will provide an up-front statement to  that effect.</p>
<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may  need to disclose personal information when required by law or where we have a  good-faith belief that (a) such action is necessary to comply with a current  judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website; (b)  such action is necessary to protect and defend our rights or property, the  Website or our uses; (c) such action is necessary to protect the personal  safety of us, our affiliates, agents, or the users of the Website or the  public.</p>
<p>The Website is published in the United States. We make every  effort to protect the personal identifiable information of all users the  Website. We attempt to comply with local data protection and consumer rights  laws to the extent they may apply to the Extensis services.&nbsp; If you are uncertain whether this privacy  policy conflicts with the applicable local privacy laws where you are located,  you should not submit your Personal Information to Extensis.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We may change its ownership or corporate organization while  providing the Website and services.&nbsp; As a  result, please be aware that we may transfer your information to another  company that is affiliated with us or with which we have merged.&nbsp; Under such circumstances Extensis would to  the extent possible require the acquiring party to follow the practices  described in this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time.</p>
<p>If you are located within the European Union, you should be  aware that your personal identifiable information will be transferred to the  United States of America, the laws of which may be deemed by the European Union  to have inadequate data protection. If you are located in a country outside the  United States of America and voluntarily submit personal information to us, you  thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this  privacy policy and to the transfer of that information to, and/or storage of  that information in, the United States of America.</p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of  Company who are California residents to request certain information regarding  its disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct  marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@extensis.com">info@extensis.com</a>.</p>
