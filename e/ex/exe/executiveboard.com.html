              <ul>
                  <li>to respond to inquiries that you submit to us about CEB membership via the online "contact us" feature and determine which Programs and services will help you achieve your business goals;</li>

                <li>to communicate with you about surveys, marketing, promotions, executive-oriented events, educational forums, and other exclusive opportunities offered by CEB and its partners and affiliates, including information about other CEB Programs in which you may be interested;</li>

              <p><u>Community Areas</u><em>. &nbsp;</em>In certain Community Areas on the CEB Sites, Members can tap into our membership directory and locate other Members able to help them deal with specific questions and challenges. To participate in these Community Areas, Members are asked to create an online profile, which includes information about their job and title. This profile enables other Members participating in the same Community Areas to determine whether the Member’s background and expertise might make him or her a useful contact on a particular issue. When you participate in Community Areas by creating an online profile, you are making information about you (including contact and institutional information) available to other Members. Based on this determination, one Member might use another Member’s information to contact that Member to obtain the benefit of their expertise. By providing personal information for publishing to a profile in Community Areas, you acknowledge and agree that Members can see and use that information, and that their use (and any use by third parties to whom they disclose the information) is not subject to the terms of this Policy. </p>
              <p><u>Discussion Forums</u>. In the event that you post personal information in discussion forums or other areas of the CEB Sites allowing users to upload or post content, that information can be viewed by any user with access to those areas. We discourage users from posting personal information in this fashion, and any personal information you post to these public or Member areas is not covered by this Policy. </p>
