<p><b>Exodus takes your privacy very seriously. Your email address will NOT be sold or disclosed to any other parties.</b></p><p>This Privacy Policy describes exactly how Exodus uses personal information such as name, address, email address or credit card number ('Customer Information'). </p><p>By registering your details with Exodus, you consent to the collection and use of information in the manner described below. If we decide to change our privacy practice, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p><h3>What Customer Information does Exodus collect?</h3><p>Customer Information is requested whenever you choose to use certain Exodus services. The type of Customer Information we request has to do specifically with the type of service you are using. For example: </p><ul><li>When you request a trip note on the Website, we will ask you to provide your first name and last name and an email address.</li></ul><ul><li>When you request a brochure to be posted to you we will ask you to provide your first name and last name, full postal address and an email address.</li></ul><ul><li>When you request an e-brochure we will ask you to provide your first name and last name, full postal address and an email address.</li></ul><ul><li>When you register for <i><b>My Exodus</b></i> we will ask you to provide a screen name and password, first name, last name and email address as a minimum. It is at your discretion whether you wish to provide additional information such as place of birth, date of birth, address details and contact telephone numbers, age, location, biography, and avatar or personal image and details of past and future trips with Exodus.</li></ul><ul><li>When you want to share your pictures with others ('Friends'), we will ask for email addresses of friends and family you choose to share with.</li></ul><ul><li>When you subscribe through the Exodus Website to receive our e-newsletters we will ask you to register for <i><b>My Exodus</b></i>.</li></ul><ul><li>When you complete a purchase from Exodus, we will ask you to provide billing information so that we can fulfill your request. </li></ul><p>You also give information when you post and reply to threads on the <i><b>Compass Caf√© Community</b></i>, provide Exodus with a Review on your holiday, answer survey questions, enter competitions, etc.</p><h3>How does Exodus use Customer Information?</h3><p>Our primary goal in collecting your Customer Information is to provide you with a great personalised, relevant, user-friendly experience in all your contact with Exodus. </p><p><i>Customer Communication: </i><b>We use Customer Information to communicate with you and we consider this communication to be an integral part of the Exodus service.</b> We use your email and mailing address to inform you about special trips, newsletters, Exodus promotional offers, Website improvements, and occasional third-party partnership promotional offers that may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive these mailings you can either unsubscribe using the link supplied on all our email contact with you, change your email preferences through your <b><i>My Exodus</i></b> account, or telephone a member of our Sales team to be unsubscribed from either postal or email contact or both.<br><br><i>Customer Satisfaction:</i> <b>We use Customer Information to make your Exodus experience enjoyable. </b>For example, because we know who you are after you log in, we can present you with your <i><b>My Exodus</b></i> account and show you the right set of albums in your password-protected account. We may also use the information contained in your Wishlist to email you to let you know about availability on the trip you are interested in and about any promotional offers that may be of interest to you. <br><br><i>Customer Convenience:</i> <b>We use Customer Information to provide you with the convenience of easy access to the services you request.</b> When you choose to register for <i><b>My Exodus</b></i> on our Website and supply your address and contact details, we will use this information to partially complete your booking form so that you won‚Äôt have to fill out that information each time you book with Exodus. </p><h3>With whom does Exodus share Customer Information?</h3><p>Exodus shares Customer Information with third party intermediaries (for example, credit card authorization companies, merchandise distributors, vendors processing our outbound email communication, etc.) who help us to provide you with a quality service. Your Customer Information is provided to these third parties solely for the purpose of providing you the services you request at the time that you request them. Third party intermediaries do not store, retain, access or otherwise use your Customer Information other than as necessary to provide you with the Exodus service.</p><h3>Who sees your photos after they have been posted online?</h3><p>Who sees your photos is determined by the settings you select in your <i><b>My Exodus</b></i> account. You may choose to send an email to your ‚Äò<b>Friends</b>‚Äô including a link to your photo album(s) saved in you‚Äôre <i><b>My Exodus</b></i> account. To enable this link to be forwarded to your Friends you will need to supply an email address for your friend(s). The email address supplied will not be used by Exodus for marketing purposes.  When you choose to share your online images with Friends, those individuals will be able to view your album. <b>Please note</b>, as with any email, your friends could forward the email invitation to others, who will then be able to click on the link to the album within the email, and see the pictures too. <br><br>You may choose to ‚Äò<b>Share your album with everyone</b>‚Äô and thereby publish your album on the Exodus Website by assigning it a 3-character trip code. Your album will then be displayed in the Images section for that trip and will potentially be visible to anyone that visits the Website.<br><br>Exodus employees or employees of partner companies that provide services to Exodus may see your photos even if they are not published on the Website as a result of carrying out maintenance on the Website or correcting problems with your account.</p><h3>Does Exodus use "IP Addresses" and cookies?</h3><p>Exodus uses IP Addresses and Cookies in limited ways, as follows: <br><i>IP Addresses:</i> An IP address is literally your computer's address and is a unique identifier, allowing online information to be sent to the right place. We use IP addresses to better understand the customer database. In particular, we use your IP address to establish where you are located geographically to enable the Website to display whether a trip is offered as a package including flights or on a land only basis, and in which currency to display our prices. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Website. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members. We do not intentionally link your IP address to your personally identifiable information. <br><br><i>Exodus Cookies:</i> The job of a cookie is to record only information you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer the first time you visit our Website that enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are next time you come back. Cookies may be used to retain your personal preferences, hold session information (for example the dates you have used for your trip search), or save your password so it doesn't have to be re-entered each time you log in. <br><br><i>Advertiser Cookies:</i> Exodus does post third party advertising banners with carefully selected partners. These ads may contain cookies used primarily to provide data to the advertiser about where visitors are coming from. While we do use cookies in other parts of our Website as explained above, cookies received with banner ads may or may not be collected or controlled by our company. When you click on a banner ad, you should be aware that the advertiser might be collecting information without the permission of Exodus. Exodus does not control the privacy practices of these services. To find out more about how they manage privacy of information, please review their privacy policies. <br><br><i>Advice on Limiting Cookies: </i>You always have a choice with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you can accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set or reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies, you may be unable to use certain Exodus services. Please consult your browser instructions for information on how to modify your choices about cookies.</p><h3>What are the safeguards and security procedures in place to protect your information from loss, misuse, or alteration?</h3><p>Your Customer Information on our Service is password-protected. We strongly recommend that you do not give your password to anyone and that you change it every 3 months. You may edit your Exodus account information by using your Exodus member name and password in the ‚ÄòMy Profile‚Äô section of your <i><b>My Exodus</b></i> account. <br><br><b>Please note</b> Exodus is particularly sensitive to protecting information about children on the Internet; kids under 13 are not eligible to set up their own <i><b>My Exodus</b></i> account. However, we encourage parents to use our service as a family activity with their children and to carefully monitor any Internet activities, including the uploading of images, by their kids. </p><h3>Exodus will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.</h3><p>You will only be asked for your member name and password when you initiate the contact with a member of the Web Team and only if the member name and password are necessary to correct a service problem. </p><h3>How can you update or correct Customer Information?</h3><p>Customer Information that you provide during registration is available in your <i><b>My Exodus</b></i> online account. To edit your Customer Information, you must login to <i><b>My Exodus</b></i> and then go to ‚Äò<i>My Profile</i>‚Äô where you will be able to edit your account information and determine what information may be viewed publicly.</p><p><i>Links from the Exodus Site</i>: If you click away from Exodus to visit the site of any third party advertiser or sponsor, you may be asked for your credit card or other personal information in order to purchase or use products and services offered. These companies have their own privacy and data collection practices. As described above, Exodus has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You should therefore review their privacy policies carefully if you have concerns about how your information may be used. </p><p><i>Notification of Change</i>: If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner that is materially different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Website notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice, we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p><p><i><b>Contacting Exodus</b></i>: If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Website, you can contact us at:<br>Exodus Travels Ltd<br>Grange Mills<br>Weir Road<br>London<br>SW12 0NE<br>0845 863 6008</p><p>Or visit the <a href="/contact-us" title="Contact Exodus" target="_blank">Contact us</a> page for more contact information</p></div>
