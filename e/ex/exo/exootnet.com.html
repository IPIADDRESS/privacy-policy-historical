<div id="content" class="clearfix rounded">

  <p>Your privacy matters to Exoot so whether you are new to Exoot or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions <a href="/misc/contact">contact us</a>. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we're using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.</p>
<h2>Information we collect</h2>
<p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users   – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more   complex things like which games you’ll find most useful or the people who   matter most to you online. </p>
<p><strong>Information you give us. </strong>For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Exoot Account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address or birthday. </p>
<p><strong>Information we get from your use of our services.</strong> We   may collect information about the services that you use and how you use   them, like when you visit a website that uses our app services   or you view and interact with our games and content. This information   includes:</p>
<p><strong>Log information</strong></p>
<p>When you use our services or view content provided by Exoot, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>details of how you used our service, such as your search queries. </li>
  <li>Internet protocol address. </li>
  <li>device event information such as crashes, system activity,   hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of   your request and referral URL. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Device information</strong></p>
<p>We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware   model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile   network information including phone number). </p>
<p><strong>Cookies and anonymous identifiers</strong></p>
<p>We use various technologies to collect and store information when   you visit a Exoot service, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device.=</p>
<p><strong>External Sites</strong></p>
<p>Exoot is not responsible for the content of external internet sites. You are advised to read the privacy policy of external sites before disclosing any personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Signup</strong></p>
<p>When you signup for Exoot Account, we may collect your Facebook account information including but not limited to your name, email address, birthday, list of friends and we'll try to predict your location based on your IP address.</p>
<h2>How we use information we collect</h2>
<p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to   provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to   protect Exoot and our users. We also use this information to offer you   tailored content – like giving you more relevant games and contents.</p>
<p>When you contact Exoot, we may keep a record of your communication to   help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address   to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about   upcoming changes or improvements. </p>
<p>We may combine personal information from one service with information,   including personal information, from other Exoot services – for example   to make it easier to share things with people you know. </p>
<p>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>Exoot processes personal information on our servers in many countries   around the world. We may process your personal information on a server   located outside the country where you live. </p>
<h2">Accessing and updating your personal information
<p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to   your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to   give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to   keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When   updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your   identity before we can act on your request. </p>
<p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require   disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system   or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of   others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests   concerning information residing on backup tapes). </p>
<p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will   do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort.   We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information   from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you   delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete   residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information   from our backup systems. </p>
<h2>Transparency and choice</h2>
<p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about   what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices   about how it is used. </p>
<h2>Information you share</h2>
<p>Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember   that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search   engines. Our services provide you with different   options on sharing and removing your content. </p>
<h2>Information we share</h2>
<p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations   and individuals outside of Exoot unless one of the following   circumstances apply: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>With your consent</strong></p>
    <p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations   or individuals outside of Exoot when we have your consent to do so. We   require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>For external processing</strong></p>
    <p>We provide personal information to our affiliates or other   trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our   instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other   appropriate confidentiality and security measures. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>For legal reasons</strong></p>
    <p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations   or individuals outside of Exoot if we have a good-faith belief that   access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably   necessary to: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request. </li>
      <li>enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations. </li>
      <li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. </li>
      <li>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Exoot, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="application">Application</h2>
<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Exoot Systems  Inc. and its affiliates, including services offered on other sites, but excludes services that have separate   privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other   companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be   displayed to you in search results, sites that may include Exoot   services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy   does not cover the information practices of other companies and   organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel   tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads. </p>
