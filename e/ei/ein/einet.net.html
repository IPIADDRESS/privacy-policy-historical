<p>
We at Galaxy, owned and operated by AHN/FIT Internet, LLC (referred to as "Galaxy"), understand that the Internet presents an opportunity for us to reach you, the public, in new and exciting ways with information about our programming, interactive content, news, and other forms of interaction.

Galaxy encourages parents to supervise their children's activities online and to participate with their children whenever possible and to consider installing parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help ensure children's safety online.  These tools can prevent children from disclosing personally identifiable information, such as their name, address or e-mail address without parental permission.  Galaxy does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. <b>You must be 18 years or older to make any purchases on Galaxy.</b>
