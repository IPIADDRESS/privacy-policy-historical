            In the course of delivering an advertisement to Galaxy visitors, Galaxy,
            or its advertising agency, does not collect any personally-identifiable
            information about the Web site user, such as the user's name, address,
            phone number or email address. Galaxy's advertising agency does, however,
            collect non-personally identifiable information, such as the server
            a user's computer is logged onto, the user's browser type (for example,
            Netscape or Internet Explorer), and whether the user responded to
            the advertisement delivered. </font>
          </p><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>PERSONALLY
            IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</b><br>
            Personally identifiable information about our visitors is collected
            only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted by those visitors. Galaxy
            uses such information only for the purpose for which it was submitted,
            unless we disclose other uses at the time of collection. Galaxy does
            not sell personal information to third parties. Galaxy may share personally
            identifiable information with other parts of our company, but this
            will never be used on an individual basis outside of the company.
            Galaxy maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity,
            and privacy of personally identifiable information in its possession.
            Galaxy may use such personally identifiable information in the aggregate
            (non-identifiable) form to make our Web site better and more responsive
            to the needs of our visitors. This statistical compilation of non-identifiable
            information may also be used by or provided to others for marketing,
            advertising, or research purposes. If you choose to submit your site to a
            Galaxy Directory or Vertical Engine, you agree to accept emails from and for
            products developed by LOGIKA Corporation and/or its partners.</font>

            TO OTHER SITES</b><br>
            Galaxy chooses its advertisers and business partners carefully. However,
            Galaxy is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of
            Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our Web sites.
            These links are meant for the visitor's convenience only. Links to
            third party Web sites do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement,
            or approval by Galaxy of content, policies or practices of such sites.
            Once you have left a Galaxy Web site via such a link, you should check
            the applicable privacy policy of the third party site. Galaxy may
            also be linked to Web sites operated by companies affiliated with

            policies and practices. </font>

            AND/OR CONTESTS</b><br>
            From time to time, sweepstakes, contests, games and other promotions
            may run on Galaxy Web sites which may require the visitor to provide
            some personally identifiable information such as full name, address,
            e-mail address, and phone number, in order to participate. Galaxy
            may use a reputable third party to manage and administer some of its
            sweepstakes and/or contests. This third party may have access to some
            of the personally identifiable information that is provided by the
            visitor in order to participate in the sweepstakes and/or contest.
            In those instances, the third party will be instructed by Galaxy to
            use the personally identifiable information only for the specific
            sweepstakes and/or contest related purpose for which it was requested.
            Most often this information is used only to select and contact winners
            of the sweepstakes and/or contests. Any other use of the personally
            identifiable information by the third party is strictly prohibited.
            Our sweepstakes and/or contests are targeted to individuals 18 years
            of age and older, individuals under 18 years of age are not eligible
            to participate. Galaxy requires proof of age in order to collect any
            prizes awarded. </font>
