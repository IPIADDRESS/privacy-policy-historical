            collect non-personally identifiable information, such as the server 
            a user's computer is logged onto, the user's browser type (for example, 
            Netscape or Internet Explorer), and whether the user responded to

            IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</b><br>
            Personally identifiable information about our visitors is collected 
            only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted by those visitors. Galaxy 
            uses such information only for the purpose for which it was submitted, 
            unless we disclose other uses at the time of collection. Galaxy does 
            not sell personal information to third parties. Galaxy may share personally 
            identifiable information with other parts of our company, but this 
            will never be used on an individual basis outside of the company. 
            Galaxy maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity, 
            and privacy of personally identifiable information in its possession. 
            Galaxy may use such personally identifiable information in the aggregate 
            (non-identifiable) form to make our Web site better and more responsive 
            to the needs of our visitors. This statistical compilation of non-identifiable

            Galaxy chooses its advertisers and business partners carefully. However, 
            Galaxy is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of 
            Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our Web sites. 
            These links are meant for the visitor's convenience only. Links to 
            third party Web sites do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement, 
            or approval by Galaxy of content, policies or practices of such sites. 
            Once you have left a Galaxy Web site via such a link, you should check 
            the applicable privacy policy of the third party site. Galaxy may 
            also be linked to Web sites operated by companies affiliated with 
            Galaxy. Visitors to those sites should refer to their separate privacy 
            policies and practices. </font>

            AND/OR CONTESTS</b><br>
            From time to time, sweepstakes, contests, games and other promotions 
            may run on Galaxy Web sites which may require the visitor to provide 
            some personally identifiable information such as full name, address, 
            e-mail address, and phone number, in order to participate. Galaxy 
            may use a reputable third party to manage and administer some of its 
            sweepstakes and/or contests. This third party may have access to some 
            of the personally identifiable information that is provided by the 
            visitor in order to participate in the sweepstakes and/or contest. 
            In those instances, the third party will be instructed by Galaxy to 
            use the personally identifiable information only for the specific 
            sweepstakes and/or contest related purpose for which it was requested. 
            Most often this information is used only to select and contact winners 
            of the sweepstakes and/or contests. Any other use of the personally 
            identifiable information by the third party is strictly prohibited. 
            Our sweepstakes and/or contests are targeted to individuals 18 years 
            of age and older, individuals under 18 years of age are not eligible 
            to participate. Galaxy requires proof of age in order to collect any 
            prizes awarded. </font>
