        privacy is important to us and is taken seriously. This Privacy Statement 
        covers how we at eGuide treat personal information about you that is personally 
        identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number. 
        If you have voluntarily provided information and unless otherwise informed 
        by you, we will deem that you have consented to the collection and use 
        of your personally identifiable information as described in this Privacy 
        Statement.<br>
        <br>
        <font size="2" color="#003300">Collection and Use</font><br>
        If you are only browsing the Website, we do not capture data that allows 
        us to identify you individually.<br>
        <br>
        We collect personal information when you contact us, register with us 
        or where you are required to enter any of the mentioned personally identifiable 
        information like your email address or name, and when you take part in 
        any promotions or contests conducted through eGuide. This is in order 
        that we can serve you in a more efficient and effective way, unless such 
        sharing is prohibited by legislation. For your convenience, we may also 
        display to you data you had previously supplied us. This will speed up 
        the transaction and save you the trouble of repeating previous submissions. 
        Should the data be out-of-date, please supply us the latest data.<br>
        <br>
        We have put in place reasonably adequate safeguards to protect information 
        that we have collected about you. We limit access to personal information 
        about you to employees whom we reasonably believe need to have access 
        to in order to do their jobs.<br>
        <br>
        We do not rent, sell or share personal information about you with third 
        parties, save for affiliated companies and trusted business partners. 
        However, we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating 
        to eGuide services and products, announcements, promotions, contests or 
        newsletters. If you do not wish to receive such offers or mailings, you 
        can easily choose to unsubscribe from the received publications.<br>
        <br>
        In the event that we do share such collected information in accordance 
        with this Privacy Statement, the disclosure will be limited to only aggregated 
        information which will not identify you. Recipients of such information 
        will also be restricted to using the information for the purpose for which 
        it was disclosed and for no other unauthorized purposes.<br>
