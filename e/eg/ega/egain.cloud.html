<p>eGain is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequent transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. eGain complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the European Union (EU) and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>
<p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, eGain is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, eGain may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>

<p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website [<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint</a>], you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p>
<p>eGain has further committed to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU and Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship.</p>
<p>eGain complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. eGain has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

<p><strong>Your European Privacy Rights</strong></p>
<p>If you are an individual in the EU, we collect and process personal data about you only where we have legal basis for doing so under applicable EU laws, including under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (âGDPRâ). The legal bases depend on the Service(s) you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your personal data only where:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need it to provide you the Service(s), including to operate the Service(s), provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Service(s);</li>
<li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Service(s) and to protect our legal rights and interests;</li>
<li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or</li>
<li>We need to process your personal data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have consented to our use of personal data about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your personal data because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Service(s).</p>
<p>We may use your email address to send you marketing communications or to inform you about our Service(s), such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements. We will ask for your consent in line with the applicable law when you first provide your personal data. We also allow you to opt out by following the unsubscribe directions in such communications.</p>
<p>If you wish to exercise any privacy right that is available to you, we will process your request in accordance with applicable data protection laws. We may need to retain certain information for record-keeping purposes and/or to complete transactions that you began prior to requesting any deletion. This set of processing rights excludes all situations in which eGain processes personal data of eGainâs customers and/or the customersâ clients on or through the eGain platform, where eGain is a processor and not a controller.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right not to provide consent or to withdraw consent.</strong> Where we seek to rely on your consent in order to process certain parts of your personal data, you have the right not to provide your consent or to withdraw your consent at any time. In case of withdrawal, eGain will not process the personal data subject to this consent any longer unless legally required to do so. In case we are required to retain your personal data for legal reasons, such data will be restricted from further processing and only retained for the term required by law. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Furthermore, if your use of a good or service requires your prior consent, we will no longer be able to provide the relevant good or service to you after withdrawal of your consent.</li>
<li><strong>Right of Information and Access.</strong> You can require eGain to confirm at any time that eGain is processing your personal data, or to have access to the personal data eGain may have about you. You may also request information about the purpose of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, third parties that might have received the data from eGain, the source of the personal data, if you did not provide it directly to eGain, and how long it will be stored. Reasonable access to your personal data will be provided at no cost to you upon request. If access cannot be provided within a reasonable time frame, eGain will provide you with a date when the information will be provided. If for some reason access is denied, eGain will provide an explanation as to why access has been denied.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Rectification.</strong> You have a right to correct the record of your personal data maintained by eGain if it is inaccurate.</li>
<li><strong>Right of Erasure.</strong> In certain circumstances, you may have the right to the erasure of personal data that we hold about you, such as it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally collected.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Data Portability.</strong> If eGain uses your personal data on the legal basis of either your consent or performance of a contract with you, you may also request from eGain a copy of the personal data you provided to us, clearly stating which personal data you require from eGain in which format and whether the personal data shall be provided to you or another recipient. We will carefully review your request and discuss with you how it can be best implemented.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Restriction of Processing.</strong> You can request from eGain that eGain restricts your personal data from any further processing in any of the following events: (i) you state that the personal data eGain has about you is incorrect, (but only for as long as we are required to check the accuracy of the relevant personal data), (ii) there is no legal basis for us processing your personal data and you demand that we restrict your personal data from further processing, (iii) we no longer require your personal data but you claim that you require us to retain such data in order to claim or exercise legal rights or to defend against third party claims or (iv) in case you object to the processing of your personal data by us, where based on our legitimate interest, for as long as it is required to review as to whether we have a prevailing interest or legal obligation in processing your personal data.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Object to Processing based on Legitimate Interest.</strong> Where we rely on our legitimate interest to process certain parts of your personal data, you have the right to object to such processing at any time. If you do so, we will cease using your personal data and remove it from our systems unless such personal data is permitted to be used by eGain for another purpose set out in this Privacy Policy or we determine and demonstrate a compelling legitimate interest to continue in processing your personal data.</li>
<li><strong>Right to lodge a complaint.</strong> If you take the view that eGain is not processing your personal data in accordance with the requirements set out in the Privacy Statement or applicable EU data protection laws if such laws apply to you, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the data protection authority of the EU country where you live or with the data protection authority of the country or state where the eGain controller that collected your personal data has its registered seat.</li>
</ul>
