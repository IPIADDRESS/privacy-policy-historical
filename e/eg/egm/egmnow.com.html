		<strong>ELECTRONIC GAMING MONTHLY PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>
		Thank you for visiting EGMNOW.com, an EGM Media, LLC website. Your privacy is important to us and to better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used by EGM Media, LLC.</p>
<p>
		<u>What Data Is Collected By EGM?</u></p>
<p>
		Through EGM Media, LLC print publications, digital publications, websites, and other media, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as EGM(i): The Digital Magazine, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. You are able to visit much of this website and enjoy many EGM Media, LLC publications and promotions without providing any personally identifiable information. Sometimes, however, we do need your personally identifiable information to provide you with the products and services that you request. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages and elsewhere include, but are not limited to: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.</p>
<p>
		At some EGM Media, LLC sites and through certain promotions, you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic message and, if you order a gift online or offline and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.<br>
		For certain promotions, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the promotion's activities and offerings.</p>
<p>
		We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, and the domain name of your Internet service provider.</p>
<p>
		<u>How We Use the Information<br>
		</u></p>
<p>
		We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>
		We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online or digital publication, or to contact you about your account with us.</p>
<p>
		We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards. From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs, or services to them.</p>
<p>
		If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a "letter to our editors"), we may publish your name, screen name, and other information you have provided to us without further notification or request for permission.</p>
<p>
		The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services.</p>
<p>
		We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our publications and websites and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.</p>
<p>
		We will disclose information we maintain when required by law, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request.</p>
<p>
		Agents and contractors of EGM Media, LLC who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for EGM Media, LLC.</p>
<p>
		We may transfer your personally identifiable information to other EGM Media, LLC offices for internal management and administrative purposes. Your personal data will be transferred to other EGM Media, LLC offices where necessary for the performance or conclusion of our contractual obligations to you or for your benefit. Transfers of personally identifiable information may also be made where necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>
<p>
		Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.</p>
