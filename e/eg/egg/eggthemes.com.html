	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>eggthemes is committed to protecting your privacy.  This Privacy Policy explains our privacy practices for our website,  eggthemes.com on the World Wide Web (the "Site"), as well as for eggthemes services that may be accessed through the normal use of our  products (the "Services"). You can travel through most of our Site  without giving us any information about yourself. But sometimes we do  need information to provide services that you request. The following  statement explains our information-gathering and dissemination  practices. Please read the complete eggthemes Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ul>
		<li>General Information</li>
		<li>Information Collection and Use</li>
		<li>If You Opt to Receive Communications, How We Will Contact You</li>
		<li>Site Functionality</li>
		<li>Security of Your Information</li>
		<li>Correcting/Updating Personal Information</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>General Information</h3>
	<p>eggthemes may periodically update this Privacy Policy. If so, eggthemes  will post the updated Privacy Policy on this Site. eggthemes encourages  you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time for any changes.</p>
	<p>By using this Site or any products or services provided through the  Site, you expressly consent to the use and disclosure of information as  described in this Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE  TERMS BELOW, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS SITE OR THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES  OFFERED BY eggthemes AT THIS SITE.</p>
	<p>Please note that the eggthemes Users Forum (coming soon) is covered by  its own privacy policy, which is available for review at any time.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
	<p>You may decide whether to proceed with any activity that requests  personally identifiable information. If you do not wish to provide the  requested information, however, you may not be able to complete the  transaction. We do not collect information from individuals under the  age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, we ask that you do not submit  any personal information through the Site. If we have specific  knowledge that an individual under the age of 13 has submitted  personally identifiable information to the Site, we will delete such  information permanently and without notice.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Except as described below, eggthemes will only disclose your  personally identifiable information to third parties if acting under a  good faith belief that such action is necessary (1) to conform to legal  requirements; (2) to protect and defend the rights or property of eggthemes ; (3) to enforce the eggthemes Terms of Service; or (4) in the  event of a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all eggthemes' assets relating to the business in connection with which the  information was collected. eggthemes collects personally identifiable  information that can be divided into the following categories:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>eggthemes Product Registration Information:</strong> Some eggthemes products ask you for certain personally identifiable  information as part of the installation/registration process (including  but not limited to your name, email address, credit card information and  connection type and number of computers). Certain of this information  is necessary in order to conclude the transaction, and for applicable  products, to be eligible to receive technical support. If you provide us  with personally identifiable information, and select the "Inform me  about important updates and news" option on the purchase confirmation  page or in the in the "Registration Information" section located in the  "Configuration Panel" of the "Control Panel" in the eggthemes product, we  use this information to send you communications, including informative  emails/newsletters about eggthemes product upgrades, product updates, new  products, and services, and to provide you with special offers that may  be of interest to you, including paid advertisements from third  parties. In the event you no longer wish to receive such information,  you may choose to opt out of receiving further communications by  complying with the procedures listed in the "Updating/Unsubscribing Your  Email Address" section of this Privacy Policy. Except in the case of  Partner Products (see below), eggthemes keeps personally identifiable  information collected in the course of installation/registration of eggthemes' products confidential and does not sell, trade, or exchange  mailing lists with any organization.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Credit Card Information</strong>: If you use a credit card to  purchase products via this Site, your name as it appears on the credit  card, the credit card number, expiration date and billing address will  be encrypted as it passes over the Internet. eggthemes does not record or  keep your credit card information for online credit-card transactions;  rather such information is simply passed through to our contracted  payment processing vendor. eggthemes may access such information through  the payment processing company, but does not do so except to process  refunds or adjustments and to the extent necessary in the event of  nonpayment or disputed payments, or as may be necessary for eggthemes'  compliance, in eggthemes' discretion, with applicable law.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Technical Support</strong>: If you request technical support  online, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the  transaction such as your name, email address and information about your  computer hardware, software, and the nature of the problem you are  experiencing. In the course of providing support, your data may be  transmitted to service providers that are under contract to eggthemes and  have agreed to abide by the provisions of this privacy policy. Such  transmissions of your data are encrypted and secure.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Partner Application</strong>: If you request participation in  the partner program online, we will ask you for information necessary  to complete the transaction such as company name, email address, and  company profile.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>If You Opt to Receive Communications, How We Will Contact You</h3>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Email</strong>: With your permission, eggthemes will send you  communications, including informative emails/newsletters about product  upgrades, product updates, new products, and services. These  communications provide you with special offers that may be of interest  to you. eggthemes uses a third-party program of outbound email technology  to send email from our servers and does not collect information about  you but does collect requests to unsubscribe.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Site Functionality</h3>
	<p><strong>Cookies</strong>: A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on the  user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a  cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information  while on our Site. Once you close your browser, the cookie simply  terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our Site, you would not  have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on  our Site. You may still use our Site if you reject the cookie. The only  drawback to this is that you will be limited in some areas of our Site.  For example, you will not be able to use certain features of our forum  or other parts of the Site that offer customized settings.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Log Files</strong>: We (eggthemes and/or our contracted web  analytics provider(s)) do keep track of the domains from which you  access our Site and Services on the World Wide Web, and may log IP  addresses or other identifiers for statistical purposes. We do this to  gather broad demographic information for aggregate use to identify and  analyze trends and the results ofour marketing efforts, to help diagnose  problems with our servers and to administer the Site and Services, and  analyze users' movements. We may periodically share aggregate  demographic information with our business partners. IP addresses and  other identifiers are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Links</strong>: This Site contains links to other sites.  Please be aware that we eggthemes are not responsible for the privacy  practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you  leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web  site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy  statement applies solely to information collected by this Site.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Newsletter</strong>: If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Security of Your Information</h3>
	<p>All information gathered on the Site is stored and maintained in  secure facilities. In addition, internal security provides that this  information is coded with restricted access, and our servers are kept in  a secure, locked environment that limits access to authorized personnel  only. All eggthemes employees, and all external service providers who  may process and/or store customer data, are briefed about the company's  privacy and security policies on a regular basis. The Site is regularly  tested for security breaches to ensure that all information collected is  secure from unauthorized viewing. Any service providers with whom eggthemes contracts, and who receive, store, or process personally  identifiable customer data, have committed to abide by the provisions of  this privacy policy. All transmissions of personally identifiable  customer data are encrypted and secure.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>If you have any questions about the security at our Site, you can send an email to
	<a href="mailto:privacy@eggthemes.com" title="mail to privacy@eggthemes.com">privacy@eggthemes.com</a>.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Please note that this email address will reject messages with attachments of any kind.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Correcting/Updating Personal Information</h3>
	<p>You are free to update your information at any time directly through  our Site. At your request, eggthemes will change your information; we may  request evidence of your identity before doing so.
