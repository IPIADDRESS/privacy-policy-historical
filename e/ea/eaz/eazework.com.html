You may accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, however you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies.</p>
<p>In addition to cookies, our site uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, which may include web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of web sites. EazeWork also uses these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our web site, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our web site.</p>
<h3><a name="information_sharing_and_disclosure" id="information_sharing_and_disclosure"></a>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
<p>Only authorized EazeWork employees with complete training in security and privacy processes and under managerial supervision will have access to your Personal Information. Primarily this access is needed to provide customer service and resolve application performance or system issues.</p>

<p>At times EazeWork will use third party vendors and we may need to transfer your Personal Information to them. In all such cases only the relevant information will be transferred to them and they will also be compulsorily required to follow our Privacy and Security Policy. </p>

<h3><a name="how_we_use_information_collected" id="how_we_use_information_collected"></a>How We Use Information Collected</h3>
<p>The information collected is used by us to set up the services for our users and their organizations. In addition, we may also use the information to contact you for discussions regarding our applications or the services we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events.

<h3><a name="data_security" id="data_security"></a>Data Security</h3>
<p>At EazeWork, protection of customer data and applications is of highest priority. We take all precautions to keep your data safe and secure. The platform is hosted at the state of the art data centre, using the latest firewall protection, intrusion detection systems, SSL encryption and proprietary security products and managed by a team of experts to keep customer data stored in a high security facility where even physical access is audited and controlled. All data is regularly backed up to ensure that your data is never lost, even in the worst of calamities. </p>

<p>EazeWork provides a unique user name and password to each user that must be entered each time a User logs on. A session "cookie" is issued only to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a specific session. The session "cookie" does not store either the username or password of the user or any other confidential user and session information, but instead implements more advanced security methods based on dynamic data and encoded session IDs. In addition, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects your information using both server authentication and data encryption while accessing our site using Google Chrome version 
    3.0.195.27, Microsoft Internet Explorer version 6.0 or higher, Safari version 4.0.2 and Mozilla Firefox 1.5 or later. </p>
