            <p><b> III. COOKIES AND THIRD PARTY TRACKING TECHNOLOGY</b></p>
            <p>
                A “cookie” is a small data file that may be saved to and stored on your computer                 when you visit a website or open an email. Cookies permit a website to                          “remember” whether your computer has visited the website before and helps the                   website create a more personalized experience for you and records activities                    taken by you, such as offers completed.
                In addition to cookie technology, EarningStation.com and our Advertisers use                    additional third party technology and tracking tools to record offers and                       activities completed by you, friends referred by you, and to communicate                        information about you, such as demographic information (e.g., age, gender), in                  order to target offers and advertisements to specific groups as requested by                    Advertisers.

More importantly, if you do not              accept Cookies and Recording Tools you will not receive credit for offers or other              actions completed by you because we and our Advertisers are unable to track and                 record your activity.
