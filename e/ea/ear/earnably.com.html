<p class="policy">These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to the extent necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are subject to strict contractual controls such that any data is only used in accordance with this policy and they are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

<li>To provide you with information about other goods and services we offer that are similar to those that you have already purchased or enquired about;</li>
<li>To provide you, or permit selected third parties to provide you, with information about goods or services we feel may interest you. If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiations of a sale to you. If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this. If you do not want us to use your data in this way, or to pass your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, you may opt-out of receiving any, or all, of these communications by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send. However, you acknowledge that this will limit our ability to provide the best possible products and services to you.</li>

<li>part of our efforts to keep our Service safe and secure;</li>
<li>To personalize your experience with any partner of ours who advertises on our website ("Advertiser") and whose content you interact with. If you click on an advertiser's link on our website then you will be taken to the advertiser's own website. We may be asked by the advertiser to provide certain personal information to them, such as your email address or demographic information. If you do not agree to us sending our advertisers this information then please do not click on any of the links on our website. Any interaction you have with an advertisement on our website may also mean that the advertiser collects non-identifiable information relating to you such as your IP address, your browser, your operating system and your interaction with their website.</li>  
<li>To measure or understand the effectiveness of advertising we serve to you and others, and to deliver relevant advertising to you;</li>

<p class="policy">We may transfer your collected data to storage outside the European Economic Area (EEA). By giving us your personal data, you agree to this arrangement.</p>

<p class="policy">We will do what we reasonably can to keep your data secure. Although we try to provide protection, we cannot guarantee complete security for your data, and you take the risk that any sending of that data turns out to be not secure despite our efforts.</p>

<p class="policy">We only keep your personal data for as long as we need to in order to use it as described above, and/or for as long as we have your permission to keep it. In any event, we will conduct an annual review to ascertain whether we need to keep your personal data. Your personal data will be deleted if we no longer need it.</p>

<h2>Links To Other Sites</h2>

<p class="policy">Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that they have their own privacy policies.
