<p>Earth Day Network respects your right to privacy. Earth Day Network will only collect Personal Information (defined below) that you voluntarily provide to us and will only disclose it or use it for purposes as disclosed in this Privacy Policy or as disclosed by us at the time information is requested from you. </p>

<b></b><p><b>Personal Information</b> </p>

<p>When you visit our website, Earth Day Network does not automatically collect any information that could personally identify you. Personal information includes your name, street address, email address, billing information, credit card number and expiration date, and any other personally identifying information you may provide ("Personal Information"). Your Personal Information is only collected when you voluntarily submit it, for example, when you order products through the Earth Day Store, subscribe to our newsletter or email updates, participate in online interactive activities (such as chat rooms and bulletin boards), endorse our campaigns, sign up as a volunteer, list your event or group, make a donation, submit content or suggestions, or register for sweepstakes or contests. </p>

<p>In addition to the ways described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy or at the time information is requested, we may use Personal Information received from visitors to our website for any of the following purposes: (1) to confirm, process and fulfill product orders; (2) to award prizes; (3) to respond to specific requests made by the visitor; (4) to demonstrate public support for policy proposals; (5) to provide to other environmental groups for use in collaborative educational and mobilizing efforts seeking to promote responsible environmental attitudes and policies; (6) to obtain parental consent for visitors under eighteen (18) years of age, when necessary; or (7) to protect the security or integrity of our website when necessary.</p>

<p>With the exceptions noted above, any Personal Information received from you will be retained by Earth Day Network and will not be sold, transferred or otherwise disclosed to any third party, unless such disclosure is required by law or court order.</p>

<b></b><p><b>Technical Information and Traffic Data</b> </p>

<p>Each time you come to the Earth Day Network website, our web server (like most on the web) collects some basic technical information, including your IP address, your domain name, referral data (for example, the address of the last URL you were at before clicking through to our website) and browser and platform type ("Technical Information"). Earth Day Network may use this Technical Information to improve our website and make it more responsive to our visitors (see "Cookies" below). The Technical Information provided by our server is not linked to any of your Personal Information.</p>

<p>We also count, track, and aggregate your activity on the website into our analysis of general traffic flows at the site, allowing us to identify broad demographics about who uses the Earth Day Network website ("Traffic Data"). This Traffic Data is kept anonymously so that any such information does not personally identify you. We may share this Traffic Data with others. For example, we may report to third parties, such as the press, that a certain number of our volunteers come from a specific geographic area. </p>

<b></b><p><b>Cookies</b> </p>

<p>
A "Cookie" is a short line of text stored on your computer by a website to differentiate between one anonymous visitor and another.  For Grist Magazine and all parts of the Earth Day website other than the Earth Day Store, we only use Cookies for the limited purpose of counting the number of anonymous visitors to our site; we do not collect or store any personal information about you using Cookies.</p>

<p>In the Earth Day Store, we assign Cookies to shoppers for additional purposes, such as tracking the items in your shopping cart.  Cookies help us recognize you as a prior customer and allow us to serve special features, which might be of interest to you. To better serve your needs, we will store your personal Earth Day Store online visiting preferences, but we will not store any Personal Information about you using Cookies technology. </p>

<b></b><p><b>How We Use Your Information</b> </p>
