EarthLink Business is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information.  This Privacy 
Policy describes how EarthLink Business collects information when you access or use this website, how we use the 
collected information and the choices you have with respect to our collection and use of such information.  By 
accessing or using this website, you consent to the collection of information as outlined in this Privacy Policy 
and its use by the EarthLink Business operating companies, which include:  New Edge Network, Inc., DeltaCom, Inc., 
One Communications Corporation and STS Telecom, LLC.  
</p>

<p>
<u>Information Collected</u>
</p>

<p>
Non-personal Information
</p>

<p>
When you visit this website, we, or a third party service provider acting on our behalf ("Service Provider"), may collect 
certain non-personal information from you.  This information does not identify you personally, but may include your 
Internet Protocol ("IP") address, the website address of your point of entry to this website and information about your 
connection, computer, operating system and browser.  Additionally, we or our Service Provider may collect information 
about your browsing activity, such as the date and time you visit this website, the areas or pages of this website you 
visit, the amount of time you spend on this website, the number of times you return to this website and certain other 
website usage data.  We use this information to help improve your on-line experience, to monitor the performance of our 
website and to provide product and service offerings that will meet your business needs.
</p>

<p>
We, or our Service Provider, collect this information through the use of various technologies, including "cookies."  
A "cookie" is a small data file that certain website servers store on your hard drive for subsequent use when you visit 
them.  Cookies are often used for identifying website visitors and their previously indicated preferences.  Some of our 
websites use cookies sent by EarthLink Business, or our Service Provider, to better serve you when you return to this 
website.  Most browsers are originally set up to accept cookies, but you should be able to set your browser to refuse 
cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent so that you can decide whether to accept it.  However, it is possible 
that certain features on this website may not work properly if your browser is set to refuse cookies. 
</p>

<p>
Personal Information
</p>

<p>
From time to time, EarthLink Business or our Service Provider may request information from you in order to fulfill your 
needs or to address a specific question that you may have, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, 
credit card number and EarthLink Business company account number.  This information may be collected when you use this 
website to request information or to contact us, or use the EarthLink Business portal link in this website to order 
services from an EarthLink Business company.
</p>

<p>
You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations.  For example, you may want to give us 
information, such as your name and address or email address, in order for us to correspond with you or to process 
an order.  You may give us a description of your education and work experience in connection with an on-line job 
application for an opening at an EarthLink Business company.  You also may need to provide personal login and password 
information in order to access certain customer portals (i.e. to access your account information).  Additionally, such 
information may be collected from your direct entry of the information via a web-based form or by you providing it 
through a "chat" interface.  To better serve our customers, we also record your requests for information about the products
 and services offered by the EarthLink Business operating companies, as well as any responses you provide to us.  We also 
 maintain records of each customer's payment history and communications with our customer care department and other 
 service support employees.  This information may be used to contact you about your account and to inform you about 
 available products and services.  If you give us personal information about someone else, such as a work colleague, 
 we will assume that you have their permission to do so.  Personal information collected on this website may be combined 
 with information received from other sources.    

</p>

<p>
User Feedback
</p>

<p>
If you respond to EarthLink Business, or an employee, agent or Service Provider, through this website, via email or 
otherwise, with any information including, but not limited to, feedback, questions, requests, opinions, comments, 
suggestions, responses to surveys, or regarding the content of an EarthLink Business document, this website or any 
product and service offered by an EarthLink Business company, such information will be deemed to be non-confidential 
and EarthLink Business will have no obligation with respect to that information and may reproduce, use, disclose and 
distribute the information to others and use any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained in such information 
without limitation, except as otherwise provided by law.
</p>

<p>
<u>How EarthLink Business Uses Your Information</u>

<p>
EarthLink Business may use the information collected from this website for any of the following purposes:  (1) to provide 
services and communicate with customers; (2) to develop new products and services; (3) to respond to your inquiries; (4) 
to provide you with more relevant offers and advertising; (5) to contact you with information and promotional materials 
from the EarthLink Business companies; (6) to contact you when necessary; (7) to review the use and operation of certain 
products and services; (8) to address problems with this website or certain products and services; (9) to protect the 
security and integrity of this website and the EarthLink Business companies; and (10) for marketing, promotions or similar

other statistics about visits to this website in order to monitor website performance, enhance content and to make this 
website more informative and easier and more convenient for you to use.  
</p>

<p>
<u>How EarthLink Business May Disclose Your Information</u>
</p>

<p>
EarthLink Business will not sell, share, trade or give away any information collected or received from this website, 
unless you have consented to such disclosure.  However, we may provide third parties with aggregate statistics about 
our visitors' activities on this website for purposes of marketing, promotion or similar activities, but will not disclose 
personally identifiable information.  Additionally, we may provide information to a Service Provider to enable it perform 
a business, professional or technical support function.  EarthLink Business may disclose information about visitors, in 
the aggregate or individually, if we have a good faith reason to believe that we are required by law or legal process to 
do so, to respond to claims, to bring legal action against someone who may be violating its policies, including its 
Acceptable Use Policy, or to protect the rights, property and safety of EarthLink Business or others.  In the event 
EarthLink Business decides to sell all or part of its assets, we reserve the right to include any collected or provided 
information among the transferred assets.  
</p>

<p>
<u>Marketing Email Opt-Out</u>
</p>

<p>
You may opt out of receiving marketing-related emails from EarthLink Business by following the "unsubscribe" instructions 
at the bottom of any marketing email you receive.
</p>

<p>
<u>CPNI Protections</u>
</p>

<p>You have a right and EarthLink Business has a duty to protect the confidentiality of your Customer Network Proprietary 
Information ("CPNI"). CPNI is information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, 
usage and billing of your EarthLink Business service.  EarthLink Business will not use or disclose your CPNI except 
as permitted or required by federal law and applicable FCC regulations. We will use your CPNI only to provide to you or 
suggest other communications-related services tailored to your needs.
</p>

<p>
As an EarthLink Business customer, you have the right to impose additional restrictions on EarthLink Business' use of your 
CPNI by "opting-out."  If you opt-out, EarthLink Business and its affiliates, agents, partners, vendors or contractors 
cannot use your CPNI to market additional services to you.  Opting-out will not affect the provision of any EarthLink 
Business service to which you already subscribe, but it may prevent you from receiving certain information about 
additional services from EarthLink Business.  If we do not hear from you within 30 days after you first sign up for 
EarthLink Business service, we will assume you do not wish to opt-out.  However, you can choose to opt-out at any time.  
Your decision whether or not to opt-out will remain in effect until you change it.  In addition, EarthLink Business will 
send a notice every two years reminding you of the opportunity to opt-out. In order to opt-out, you may use any of the 
following methods: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>Visit <a href="http://www.earthlinkbusiness.com/optout" shape="rect">www.earthlinkbusiness.com/optout</a> and complete the Opt-Out Form</li>
<li>Contact Customer Service at 1-800-239-3000 (Legacy Deltacom); 1-866-636-HELP (Legacy New Edge Networks); 1-800-962-2488 (Legacy One Communications); 1-800-610-7600 (Legacy STS)</li>
<li>Notify us in writing at EarthLink Business,2150 Holmgren Way, Green Bay, WI 54304<br>You must provide the following information: (i) your name; (ii) 
service billing address; (iii) ten-digit telephone number(s); and (iv) service account number.</li>
</ul>
<p>Removing consent will not affect your current service.</p>

<p>
<u>Data Security</u>
</p>

<p>
EarthLink Business wants you to use our services with confidence, and we use reasonable efforts to keep website visitors' 
personal information secure through physical, electronic, contractual and managerial procedures to safeguard the 
information, such as restricting physical access to systems on which personal information is stored by appropriate login 
and/or password controls and storing collected information in databases that EarthLink Business controls directly or 
through our Service Provider.  Although we strive to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we 
cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent "hackers" or other unauthorized persons from illegally obtaining 
information.
</p>
