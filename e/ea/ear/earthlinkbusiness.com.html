<p>
Non-personal Information
</p>

<p>
When you visit this website, we, or a third party service provider acting on our behalf ("Service Provider"), may collect 
certain non-personal information from you.  This information does not identify you personally, but may include your 
Internet Protocol ("IP") address, the website address of your point of entry to this website and information about your

website usage data.  We use this information to help improve your on-line experience, to monitor the performance of our 
website and to provide product and service offerings that will meet your business needs.
</p>

<p>
We, or our Service Provider, collect this information through the use of various technologies, including "cookies."  
A "cookie" is a small data file that certain website servers store on your hard drive for subsequent use when you visit 
them.  Cookies are often used for identifying website visitors and their previously indicated preferences.  Some of our 
websites use cookies sent by EarthLink Business, or our Service Provider, to better serve you when you return to this 
website.  Most browsers are originally set up to accept cookies, but you should be able to set your browser to refuse

 maintain records of each customer's payment history and communications with our customer care department and other 
 service support employees.  This information may be used to contact you about your account and to inform you about 
 available products and services.  If you give us personal information about someone else, such as a work colleague, 
 we will assume that you have their permission to do so.  Personal information collected on this website may be combined

unless you have consented to such disclosure.  However, we may provide third parties with aggregate statistics about 
our visitors' activities on this website for purposes of marketing, promotion or similar activities, but will not disclose 
personally identifiable information.  Additionally, we may provide information to a Service Provider to enable it perform 
a business, professional or technical support function.  EarthLink Business may disclose information about visitors, in 
the aggregate or individually, if we have a good faith reason to believe that we are required by law or legal process to 
do so, to respond to claims, to bring legal action against someone who may be violating its policies, including its 
Acceptable Use Policy, or to protect the rights, property and safety of EarthLink Business or others.  In the event 
EarthLink Business decides to sell all or part of its assets, we reserve the right to include any collected or provided 
information among the transferred assets.

<u>Marketing Email Opt-Out</u>

You may opt out of receiving marketing-related emails from EarthLink Business by following the "unsubscribe" instructions 
at the bottom of any marketing email you receive.
</p>

<p>
<u>CPNI Protections</u>
</p>

<p>You have a right and EarthLink Business has a duty to protect the confidentiality of your Customer Network Proprietary 
Information ("CPNI"). CPNI is information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, 
usage and billing of your EarthLink Business service.  EarthLink Business will not use or disclose your CPNI except 
as permitted or required by federal law and applicable FCC regulations. We will use your CPNI only to provide to you or 
suggest other communications-related services tailored to your needs.
</p>

<p>
As an EarthLink Business customer, you have the right to impose additional restrictions on EarthLink Business' use of your 
CPNI by "opting-out."  If you opt-out, EarthLink Business and its affiliates, agents, partners, vendors or contractors 
cannot use your CPNI to market additional services to you.  Opting-out will not affect the provision of any EarthLink 
Business service to which you already subscribe, but it may prevent you from receiving certain information about 
additional services from EarthLink Business.  If we do not hear from you within 30 days after you first sign up for 
EarthLink Business service, we will assume you do not wish to opt-out.  However, you can choose to opt-out at any time.  
Your decision whether or not to opt-out will remain in effect until you change it.  In addition, EarthLink Business will 
send a notice every two years reminding you of the opportunity to opt-out. In order to opt-out, you may use any of the 
following methods:

<u>Data Security</u>
</p>

<p>
EarthLink Business wants you to use our services with confidence, and we use reasonable efforts to keep website visitors' 
personal information secure through physical, electronic, contractual and managerial procedures to safeguard the 
information, such as restricting physical access to systems on which personal information is stored by appropriate login 
and/or password controls and storing collected information in databases that EarthLink Business controls directly or 
through our Service Provider.  Although we strive to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we 
cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent "hackers" or other unauthorized persons from illegally obtaining 
information.
