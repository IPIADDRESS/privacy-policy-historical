	<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into higi’s <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.  The term “<strong>higi</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” and “<strong>us</strong>” includes higi llc and our affiliates and subsidiaries.  The Privacy Policy explains how higi may:</p>

		<li>use, and</li>
		<li>disclose</li>
	</ul>
	<p>information we obtain through the “higi Service.”</p>
	<p>The “<strong>higi Service</strong>” means any websites, mobile applications, and other services under the control of higi llc, whether partial or otherwise, in connection with providing an online or digital platform for higi’s services, including www.higi.com and higi kiosks.  The higi Service provides a platform that gives you the ability to store and track your own personal information, including certain health-related information.</p>
	<p>“<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you, such as: name, address, email address, or phone number.  We do not consider Personal Information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual.</p>
	<p>“<strong>Body Measurements</strong>” means statistics, such as weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), blood pressure and pulse measurements, and other similar information, that we collect about you when you use the higi Service.  We do not consider Body Measurements to be Personal Information unless the data is combined with Personal Information.</p>
	<p>THE HIGI SERVICE COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION</p>

			<li>use the higi Service; and</li>
			<li>communicate with us.  </li>
		</ul>
		<p>We and third parties that provide functionality on the higi Service collect information, such as anonymous usage statistics, by using cookies, server logs, and other similar technology as you use the higi Service.

	<p><strong>As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures.</strong>  We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information, other account information, and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate  to: comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; respond to your requests; or protect yours’, ours’ or  others’ rights, property, or safety.</p>
	<p><strong>Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.</strong>  If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract.  We cannot control how such entities may use or disclose such information.</p>
	<p>We may also disclose your Personal Information with your permission.</p>
	<p>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</p>
	<p>We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice), please notify us at support@higi.com.</p>
	<p>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</p>
	
	<p class="legal-boxed">We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 and we do not want it.  We will take steps to delete it if we learn we have collected it.</p>
	<p>We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use Personal Information from children under 13 years of age, and no part of the higi Service is directed to children under the age of 13.  If you learn that your child has provided us with Personal Information without your consent, you may alert us at support@higi.com.  If we learn that we have collected any Personal Information from children under 13, we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate the child’s account.</p>
	<p>INTERNATIONAL USERS</p>
	
	<p class="legal-boxed">By using the higi Service, you will transfer data to the United States.</p>
	<p>By choosing to visit the higi Service or otherwise provide information to us, you agree that any dispute over privacy or the terms contained in this Privacy Policy will be governed by the law of the state of Illinois and the adjudication of any disputes arising in connection with Company or the higi Service will be in accordance with the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
	<p><strong>If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your information to the United States and processing globally.

	<p>UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION OR POSE A QUESTION OR SUGGESTION</p>
	<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the use of your information, or to modify or update any information we have received, please contact privacy@higi.com.</p>
	<p><strong>Data Retention.</strong>  We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the higi Service.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
	<p><strong>Account Deactivation and Deletion.</strong>  If you no longer desire to use the higi Service, you may deactivate or delete your account by sending us an email to support@higi.com.  Deactivating your account puts your account on hold and is the same as you telling us not to delete any information because you might want to reactivate your account at some point in the future.  When you delete an account, you are requesting that your account and the information stored therein be permanently deleted from the higi Service.  It typically takes about one month to delete an account and all associated information, but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90 days.  You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it.  We wait 90 days before permanently deleting your account information in order to help avoid accidental or malicious removal of your information.  Please note, certain data you have provided may continue to exist in aggregate form that cannot be used to identify you.</p>
	<p>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY AND PRACTICES</p>
	
	<p class="legal-boxed">We may revise this Privacy Policy, so review it periodically.</p>
	<p><strong>Posting of Revised Privacy Policy.</strong>  We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices.  If we make any change in how we use Personal Information we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on the higi Service prior to the change becoming effective.  We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
	<p><strong>New Uses of Personal Information.</strong>  From time to time, we may desire to use Personal Information for uses not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy.  If our practices change regarding previously collected Personal Information in a way that would be materially less restrictive than stated in the version of this Privacy Policy in effect at the time we collected the information, we will make reasonable efforts to provide notice and obtain consent to any such uses as may be required by law.</p>
