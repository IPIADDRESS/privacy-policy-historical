    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last Modified:  October 28, 2008</p>
<p>This is the privacy policy of Earth Class Mail  Corp. (ECM) applicable to the website at <a href="http://www.EarthClassMail.com">www.EarthClassMail.com</a> ("the Website") and, should you become a customer, to our secure hosted software  application, which requires registration and payment and may include online postal mail, check  processing, or for other mail-related services that we perform ("the Hosted  Services"). We take very seriously the jobs of  providing high quality service and protecting your privacy. The  information below outlines the commitment we have made to protect your  privacy. We do reserve the right to change this agreement, but any  changes made will be posted here.</p>
<p>ECM adheres to the US Safe Harbor privacy principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer,  Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>The Website</strong>:&nbsp; We collect limited personal information when  you access the Website.</p>
<p> Information you provide – When  you visit the publicly-accessible Website, we collect the web page you came  from, your browser's user agent string, any keywords you used in a search  engine, your computer's IP address, the time and date, the name of the pages  your computer visited, and how long it spent on each page.</p>
<p>ECM cookies - When you visit ECM, we send to your  computer one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters -  that uniquely identify your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of  our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends. Most browsers  are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to  refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some  ECM features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. 
                  </p>
<p>This website contains links to other sites. Please be  aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other  sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read  the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally  identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information  collected by this website.</p>
<p><strong>Partners</strong>:&nbsp; We may work with a partner site, such as a  vendor, to offer you certain services. The partners do NOT, without your  knowledge and consent, collect your identity or contact information from your  visits to their websites. We  provide information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with ECM under  confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information  to help ECM communicate with you about offers from ECM and our marketing  partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share  this information.</p>
<p> For each visitor to a partner website, the  visitor's computer reaches the partner via a particular IP (Internet Protocol)  address, and the partner's servers automatically collect this IP address.</p>
<p> Cookies assist partners in tracking your  activities from our website to a partner's website that you link to from our  site. If you re-visit the partner's site directly, the partner is able to  continue to track your activities on the site and reward us for referring you.  The Cookies themselves tell the partner nothing about you personally.</p>
<p>Cookies are used in two stages of the partner  tracking: when a banner image on our site is loaded on your Web page for  viewing by you and when you click a banner on our site. The function of these  Cookies is to provide the partner with information solely for the purpose of  crediting us with referrals.</p>
<p>The partner's servers automatically generate a  unique number identifying your visit. No information is obtained from you or  your computer to generate your unique identifying number. None of the partner's  Cookies are used to perform "User Profiling".</p>
<p><strong>The Hosted Services</strong>:&nbsp; When you sign up for a Hosted Service that  requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name,  email address, and an account password). For services such as online postal  mail, we also request and store credit card or other payment account  information, address and telephone information, and physical copies of your  identification papers. For services such  as check processing and depositing, we will request and store information  relating to your banking account. All  information will be maintained in encrypted form on secure servers or in secure  physical facilities, as appropriate. We may combine the information you submit  under your account with information from other ECM services or third parties in  order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our  services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of  combining such information. We do not contact site visitors unless they have given us explicit  permission to do so, have written to us, or have begun (or completed) the  process of signing up for one of our services. Except in the unlikely event that we are required to do so by law,  personal details of your visit to our publicly-accessible website will never be  shared with any third party without your permission.</p>
<p><strong>Log information</strong> - When you use ECM services, our servers automatically record information that  your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include  information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type,  browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies  that may uniquely identify your browser. </p>
<p><strong>User  communications</strong> - When you send email or other communication to ECM,  we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond  to your requests and improve our services. 
                  </p>
<p><strong>Affiliated sites</strong> - We may offer some of our services in connection with other websites. In such  cases, personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to ECM  in order to deliver the service. We process such information in accordance with  this Policy. The affiliated sites may have different privacy practices and we  encourage you to read their privacy policies. </p>
<p><strong>Links</strong> -  ECM may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether  these links have been followed. We may use this information to improve the  quality of any customized content or advertising that we may offer. </p>
<p><strong>Other sites</strong> - This Privacy Policy applies to websites and services that are owned and  operated by ECM. We do not exercise control over third-party sites. These other  sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data,  or solicit personal information from you. </p>
<p>ECM only processes personal information for the purposes described in the  applicable Privacy Policy and/or privacy notice for specific services. In  addition to the above, such purposes include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Providing our products and services to users, including the scanning of envelope images, the display of those scanned images in notification emails to you and in your online account, the display and routing of the scanned contents of mail, and solicited advertising content; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sending you certain communications relating to ECM services, such as service       announcements, administrative messages, and the ECM newsletter, all of which are considered part of your ECM account and do not require us to offer you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Site usage tracking, in order to enable us to  monitor website traffic and usage patterns in order to continually enhance and  improve the service we offer, and for customer source information. In this  process, we may collect IP addresses (which indicate the location of your  computer on the Internet) to ensure effective technical operations. We may provide anonymous reporting for internal and external  clients.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Auditing, research, and analysis in order to maintain, protect, and improve our services; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Developing new services. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more information about how we process personal information by  referring to the privacy notices for particular services. </p>
<p>ECM processes personal information on our servers in the United States of  America and reserves the right to process personal information in other  countries. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and  according to the instructions of a third party.</p>
<h2>Choices for personal information</h2>
<p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we notify  you of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy. We also ask you to provide  personal information. If we use this information in a manner different from the  purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to  such use. </p>
<p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those  described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer  you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those  other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive personal information for  purposes other than those described in this Policy or the specific service  notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent (such as in our service  agreements). </p>
<p>You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case ECM may not be able to provide those services to you. </p>
<h2>Information sharing</h2>
<p>ECM does not rent, sell, or share personal information about  you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or  services you've requested or under the following circumstances: </p>
<ul>
<li>If we have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If we provide such information to our subsidiaries,  affiliated companies, or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of  processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties  agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance  with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security  measures, including adequate data protection principles.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a)  satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process (including without  limitation subpoenas and court orders), or enforceable governmental request,  (b) enforce applicable terms of service, including investigation of potential  violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security,  or technical issues, (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property,  or safety of ECM, its users or the public as required or permitted by law, or  (e) to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If ECM becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide  notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a  different privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who  searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a  particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually. </li>
</ul>
<p>Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data. </p>
<h2>Information security </h2>
<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access  to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. These  include internal reviews of our data collection, storage, and processing  practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard  against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. </p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to ECM employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or  improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality  obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and  criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. </p>
<p>Earth Class Mail applies rigorous security measures at  physical mail facilities, at its data centers, and within the applications that  it provides for access to those services.</p>
<p>Customers can make a written request to our customer service department to set an electronic retention period for them. The  electronic retention period begins when the original mail item leaves ECM's  possession, such as through shredding, recycling, forward-shipment, or pick-up  from a store. At the end of the retention period, the envelope and  content scans associated with the original mail item will be marked for batch  deletion.</p>
<h2>Data integrity </h2>
<p>ECM processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was  collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific  privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage, and processing  practices to ensure that we only collect, store, and process the personal  information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps  to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and  current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal  information whenever necessary. </p>
<h2>Accessing and updating personal information </h2>
<p>When you use our Hosted Services, we make good-faith efforts to provide you  with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it  is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise  required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask  individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be  accessed, corrected, or removed before processing such requests, and we may  decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic,  require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or  would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information  residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In  any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this  service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate  effort. Some of our services may have different procedures to access, correct,  or delete users' personal information. We may provide the details for these  procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services. </p>
<h2>Enforcement </h2>
<p>Enforcement – Customer Service is staffed to assist and  support our customers’ activities and accounts, and also to enforce adherence  to our User Agreement terms and conditions. Customer Service can suspend and/or terminate service for any account  for breach of those terms or operating in a manner inconsistent with the terms  of service. Earth Class Mail’s Human  Resources department also works closely with department heads to ensure  policies are adhered to and when necessary to terminate employment for any  employee, permanent or temporary, that breaches the terms of hire, or presents  a security risk.</p>
<p>ECM regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy. Please feel free to  direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or ECM's treatment of  personal information by contacting us through this website or by writing to us  at Your Privacy Rights, c/o Earth Class Mail, 93 S. Jackson Street, #101,  Seattle, Washington&nbsp; 98104. When we receive formal written complaints at  this address, it is ECM's policy to contact the complaining user regarding his  or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities,  including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints  regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between ECM and  an individual. </p>
<h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will  not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we  expect most such changes will be minor.  In any event, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the  changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including,  for certain services, email notification of Policy changes). Each version of  this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date,  and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for  your review. </p>
<p>If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Policy, please  feel free to contact us any time through this website or at Your Privacy  Rights, c/o Earth Class Mail, 93 S. Jackson Street, #101, Seattle,  Washington&nbsp; 98104. </p>
