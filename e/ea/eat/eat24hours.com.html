        </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">"Non-Personally-Identifying Information" 
          is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot 
          be directly associated with a specific person. "Personally-Identifying 
          Information," by contrast, is information such as a name or email 
          address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific 
          person. Like most website operators, Eat24Hours gathers from users of 
          the Website Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that 
          Web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That 
          information includes the user's Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating 
          system and browser type, and the locations of the Web pages the user 
          views right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after 
          leaving the Website. Eat24Hours analyzes Non-Personally-Identifying 
          Information gathered from users of the Website to help Eat24Hours better 
          understand how the Website is being used. By identifying patterns and 
          trends in usage, Eat24Hours is able to better design the Website to 
          improve users' experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. 
          From time to time, Eat24Hours may also release the Non-Personally-Identifying 
          Information gathered from Website users in the aggregate, such as by 
          publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.</font> <br>
        </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We may also periodically obtain both 
          Personally-Identifying Information and Non-Personally-Identifying Information 
          about you from other Eat24Hours-affiliated businesses, business partners, 
          contractors and other third parties and add it to our account information 
          or other information we have collected. Examples of information that 
          we may receive include: updated address information, purchase history, 
          and additional demographic information.</font> <br>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A "Web Cookie" is a string of information 
          that a website stores on a user's computer, and that the user's 
          browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to 
          the site. Eat24Hours uses Web Cookies to track the pages that users 
          visit during each Website session, both to help Eat24Hours improve users' 
          experiences and to help Eat24Hours understand how the Website is being 
          used. As with other Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered 
          from users of the Website, Eat24Hours analyzes and discloses in aggregated 
          form information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to help Eat24Hours, 
          its partners and others better understand how the Website is being used. 
          Eat24Hours does not attempt to link information gathered using Web Cookies 
          to Personally-Identifying Information. EAT24HOURS USERS WHO DO NOT WISH 
          TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS 
          TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING 
          THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT

        </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A "Web Beacon" is an object that 
          is embedded in a web page that is usually invisible to the user and 
          allows website operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular 
          web page or an email. Eat24Hours may use Web Beacons on the Website 
          and in emails to count users who have visited particular pages, viewed 
          emails, and to deliver co-branded services. Web Beacons are not used 
          to access users' Personally-Identifying Information; they are a technique 
          Eat24Hours may use to compile aggregated statistics about Website usage. 
          Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information including a Web 
          Cookie number, time and date of a page or email view, and a description 
          of the page or email on which the Web Beacon resides. You may not decline 
          Web Beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining 
          all Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each 
          time a Web Cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline Web 
          Cookies on an individual basis.  </font> <br>

          We may also share it with third parties and our affiliate companies

          of third parties. We may combine Non-Personally Identifying Information 
          we collect with additional Non-Personally Identifying Information collected 
          from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third 
          parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose 
          of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our 
          advertisers the number of visitors to our Website and the most popular 
          features or services accessed. This information does not contain any 
          Personally-Identifying Information and may be used to develop website

          collected by Eat24Hours about users is information provided by users

          That information may include each user's name, address, email address,

          information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type,

          information about your interests and activities, your gender, age, date 
          of birth, username, hometown and other demographic information, and 
          other relevant information as determined by Eat24Hours from time to
