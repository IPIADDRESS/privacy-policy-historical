With your consent, we may obtain information about your physical location through geolocation features on your device, including GPS (e.g. latitude and/or longitude). We may use this information to improve order efficiency and enhance your user experience. We may also infer your location based on other information we collect. For example, your IP Address indicates the general geographic region from which you are connecting to the Internet.</p></li><li><p>How Do We and Our Third Party Service Providers Use Information Collected from You?</p><p>We and our third party service providers may use Personal Information:</p><ul><li>to process your registration on our Sites, including verifying your information to ensure its accuracy and validity.</li><li>to fulfill your requests (e.g., to allow you to order food through our restaurant partners and have it delivered to you, or to provide you with information that you request).</li><li>to fulfill your purchases (e.g., to process credit card payments in connection with your food order).</li><li>to customize content on our Sites (e.g., the restaurants that will deliver to your location).</li><li>to send you important information regarding the Sites, such as certain changes to our terms, conditions, policies, and/or other administrative information. Because this information may be material to your use of the Sites, you may not opt out of receiving such communications.</li><li>to inform you of products, programs, services, and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you, including, without limitation, adding you to our mailing lists and sending you emails or push-notifications from time to time, and permitting you to participate in sweepstakes, contests, and similar promotions (collectively, "Promotions").</li><li>to evaluate your eligibility for certain types of Promotions, offers, products, or services that may be of interest to you.</li><li>to permit you to refer us to your friends so that we may send them a promotional offer through the Sites.

To the extent that the rules of those Promotions concerning the treatment of your Personal Information conflict with this Privacy Policy, the rules of those Promotions shall control.</li><li>to third party partners in connection with integration, co-marketing and certain other coordinated efforts.</li><li>to an affiliate or other third party in connection with a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy and/or similar proceedings).</li><li>as we believe to be appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations and/or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety, and/or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you, and/or others; (g) to permit us to pursue available remedies and/or limit the damages that we may sustain; and (h) for recordkeeping purposes.</li></ul><p>We may also share Personal Information which has been aggregated or de-identified in a manner such that the end-product does not uniquely identify you or any other user of the Sites.</p></li><li><p>Third Party Tracking and Online Advertising.</p><p>We participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your online browsing history and your interests. We permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies, and other third party services to collect information about your use of our Sites over time so that they may play or display ads on our Sites, on other websites, apps, or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies. We may share a common account identifier (such as an email address or user ID) or hashed data with our third party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We and our third party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.</p><p>To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) online resources, available at

Furthermore, if you use a different device, change browsers, or delete the opt-out cookies, you may need to perform the opt-out task again.</p><p>You may also be able to limit certain interest-based mobile advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt out of interest-based ads” (Android).</p><p>Google Analytics and Advertising. We may also utilize certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Analytics, such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.

You may control your advertising preferences or opt out of certain Google advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available at
