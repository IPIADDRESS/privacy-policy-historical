The pork needs to cure for at least an hour before cooking.   With regards to wrapping the roast in bacon, make sure the roast is completely covered by the bacon strips.  Layout the bacon strips on a cutting board to match the length of the roast.   Bring the ends of the strips of bacon up and around the sides of the roast.    As the meat cooks, the bacon slices will fuse together and adhere to the roast. -- posted by Cuisinart">Bacon-Wrapped Pork Roast With Peach Sauce</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.food.com/recipe/beef-lombardi-526386" title="Taken from America's Test Kitchen, Cook's Country April/May 2016 page 21.
