						<h1>Privacy <em id="red">Policy</em></h1>
						<p>Eat Healthy Secrets and all its related web sites (Eat Healthy Secrets) Privacy Policy
						PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. Eat Healthy Secrets DOES NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB SITE.</p>
						<p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO Eat Healthy Secrets OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES REFERRED TO IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
						<p>The information collection, use, and dissemination practices of Eat Healthy Secrets
						This policy applies to Eat Healthy Secrets collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by Eat Healthy Secrets on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the "Websites"), (b) on various third party websites. Eat Healthy Secrets is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.</p>
						<h2>1. Collection of Information.</h2>
						<h3>1.1 Survey Information.</h3>
						<p>Eat Healthy Secrets collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a Eat Healthy Secrets survey, order form, or a registration pages either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Eat Healthy Secrets or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to Eat Healthy Secrets , which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). Eat Healthy Secrets may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Eat Healthy Secrets or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Eat Healthy Secrets or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Eat Healthy Secrets.</p>
						
						<h3>1.3 Other Information.</h3>
						<p>Other occasions when Eat Healthy Secrets obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Eat Healthy Secrets or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Eat Healthy Secrets's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Eat Healthy Secrets service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").</p>
						<h3>1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</h3>
						<p>Eat Healthy Secrets currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Eat Healthy Secrets may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").</p>
						<h3>(a) Cookies.</h3>
						<p>A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Eat Healthy Secrets to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Eat Healthy Secrets database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.</p>
						<h3>(b) Web Beacons.</h3>
						<p>A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Eat Healthy Secrets to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Eat Healthy Secrets might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Bill, an individual listed in Eat Healthy Secrets's database, visits the fishing website, Eat Healthy Secrets receives notice by means of the web beacon that Bill visited the fishing site, and Eat Healthy Secrets would then update Bill's profile with the information that Bill is interested in fishing. Eat Healthy Secrets may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Bill. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Eat Healthy Secrets also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Eat Healthy Secrets's database.</p>
						<h3>(c) New Technology.</h3>
						<p>The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Eat Healthy Secrets use of new and evolving technology. As a result, Eat Healthy Secrets strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.</p>
						<h3>1.5 Outside Information.</h3>
						<p>Eat Healthy Secrets may receive information about individuals from third parties or from other sources of information outside of Eat Healthy Secrets including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").</p>
						<h3>1.6 Individual Information.</h3>
						<p>As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information Eat Healthy Secrets gathers or receives about individuals.</p>
						<h3>1.7 No Information Collected from Children.</h3>
						<p>Eat Healthy Secrets will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If Eat Healthy Secrets obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, Eat Healthy Secrets has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. Eat Healthy Secrets has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").</p>
						<h3>1.8 Credit Card Information.</h3>
						<p>Eat Healthy Secrets may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from Eat Healthy Secrets. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to Eat Healthy Secrets, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. Eat Healthy Secrets will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.</p>
