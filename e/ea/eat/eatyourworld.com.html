	<span> </span></p>
<p>
	<b>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</b></p>
<p>
	<span>This Privacy Policy covers Company’s treatment of personally identifiable information (</span>“<span>Personal Information</span>”<span>) that Company gathers when you are accessing Company’s Website and when you use Company services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.</span></p>
<p>
	<b>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT?</b></p>

	<span>The information we gather from custo</span><span>mers enables us to personalize and improve our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account and make purchases via the Website. We collect the following types of information from our customers.</span></p>
<p>
	<b>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</b></p>
<p>
	<span>We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, gender, zip code, country, IP address, browser information, and, if you make a purchase through our Website, your credit card number, credit card security code, expiration date, billing address, and shipping address. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features, and you may not be able to complete a purchase through the Website. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to purchase items, improving the content of the Website, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features.</span></p>
<p>
	<span>We do not direct any of our content specifically to children. Users of our Website are required to be at least 13 years old, and any user under 13 is not an authorized user. Additionally, if we learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will promptly delete any Personal Information we have collected about that user.</span></p>

<p>
	<em><span>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</span></em><span> We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situat</span><span>ions, these businesses sell items to you through Company’s Website. In other situations, Company provides services, or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business.</span></p>

In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Company, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Company goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that suc</span><span>h transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Company may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</span></p>
<p>
	<em><span>Protection of Company and Others:</span></em><span> We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</span></p>

	<b>IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?</b></p>
<p>
