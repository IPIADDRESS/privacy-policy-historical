Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the Eat Your World website and domain name, and any other linked pages, features, content, or application services offered from time to time by Company in connection therewith (collectively, the </span>“<span>Website</span>”<span>), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy policy</span>.<br>
	<span> </span></p>
<p>
	<b>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</b></p>
<p>
	<span>This privacy policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (</span>“<span>Personal Information</span>”<span>) that we gather when you are accessing our Website and when you use our services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</span></p>
<p>
	<b>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT?</b></p>
<p>
	<span>The information we gather from custo</span><span>mers enables us to personalize and improve our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account and make purchases via the Website and PayPal. We collect the following types of information from our customers.</span></p>
<p>
	<b>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</b><br>
	<br>
	<span>We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or voluntarily provide to us in any other way (via, for example, signing up as a member or for our newsletter, leaving comments, or a submitting a Contact form). The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, gender, zip code, country, IP address, browser information, and, if you make a purchase through our Website, your credit card number, credit card security code, expiration date, billing address, and shipping address. On our Website </span><span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you are able to create a user profile, which allows you to create a user name and password, as well as provide information like your Twitter account. We will store the user name, but your password will not be visible in our records.</span><br>
	<br>
	You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features, and you may not be able to complete a purchase through the Website. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to purchase items, improving the content of the Website, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features.</span></p>
<p>
	<span>We do not direct any of our content specifically to children. Users of our Website are required to be at least 16 years old, and any user under 16 is not an authorized user. Additionally, if we learn that a user is under 16 years of age, we will promptly delete any Personal Information we have collected about that user.</span></p>
<p>
	<b>Personal Information We Collect from Others:</b><br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: 400;"> We may receive information about you from other sources, if, for instance, you link your Facebook, Instagram, and/or Google accounts to your user profile. If you choose to link these accounts to your user profile, we will receive your name, email address, and profile picture associated with that account. We use the Disqus commenting system, so if you choose to comment on a Website post, your Disqus profile picture will appear, if you have one.</span></p>
<p>
	<b>Personal Information Automatically Collected:</b><br>
	<br>
	<span>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or services. We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, the page you requested, and any items you may purchase. This information may be used to customize the content you see on our Website or to communicate with you about specials and new features.</span><br>
	<br>
	<span>Usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, may also be used in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of </span> <span>this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</span><br>
