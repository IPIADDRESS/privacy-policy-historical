                </h4>
                
                <p>Eat Now Services Pty Ltd makes every effort to comply with the
                    principles of the Australian Privacy Act (1988). For more information about the Privacy Act visit <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au" target="_blank">www.privacy.gov.au</a>.</p>
                
                
                <h4>
                    3. What information do we collect?
                </h4>
                
                <p>You can access the home page and browse our
                    site without disclosing your personal information, but when you
                    order from our site we obviously need a certain amount on
                    information to get your order to you. So to deliver our service, you
                    will be asked to provide personal information about yourself. </p>
                
                
                <p>Personal information required during the
                    order process includes you name, delivery/billing address, phone
                    number, email address and other similar information used to identify
                    you and complete the order. There is also certain information we
                    automatically track, including the URL that you just came from, the
                    browser you are using and your IP address to protect our partner
                    restaurants against misleading or fraudulent orders. </p>
                
                
                <p>However, no information may be submitted to
                    this website by persons under the age of 18 without the consent of a
                    parent or legal guardian, nor may persons under the age of 18 make
                    purchases or other legal acts on this site without such consent
                    unless permitted by applicable legislation.</p>
                
                
                <h4>
                    4. How we use the information
                </h4>
                
                <p>Your information will enable us to provide
                    you with access to the relevant parts of the website to complete
                    your order and supply the services you have requested. Once the
                    order is confirmed, personal information collected by our site will
                    be shared with the relevant restaurant partner to enable them to
                    complete your delivery or contact you where necessary. However we
                    have a written agreement with all member restaurants restricting
                    them from further disclosure or use of personal information that we
                    provide them beyond the fulfilment of your order.</p>
                
                
                <p>Your personal information will be used to
                    notify you of the status of your order and enable us to bill you and
                    once again, to contact you where necessary. We will also use and
                    analyse the information we collect so that we can administer,
                    support, improve and develop our systems. We may also collect
                    information from any written or verbal communications with us to
                    improve our service.</p>
                
                
                <p>Personal information will not be shared
                    with any of our business partners or affiliates or outside parties
                    without your permission and will be treated as confidential. However
                    we reserve the right to disclose personal information if required to
                    do so by legal, governmental or law enforcement authority, or in the
                    good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or
advisable to protect the interests of Eat Now Services Pty Ltd. </p>

                <p>We hold personal data in accordance with
                    data protection legislation and take steps to protect your
                    information from unauthorised access and against unlawful
                    processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. The technology
                    that we use and the policies that we have implemented are intended

                    costs of retrieving this information.</p>

<p><strong>Consumers:</strong></p>
<p>Your credit or debit cards are not processed by Eat Now; therefore the details are not transmitted electronically via our website.

<p><strong>Restaurants:</strong></p>
<p>Eat Now uses an SSL (Secure Socket Layer) Certificate for the purpose of encrypting your credit card details for transmission from our servers to our Internet Payment Gateway (eWay). No Internet communication is 100% guaranteed secure, but to the best of our ability, we take steps to keep your information secure using industry standards and best practices in the handling of sensitive information.</p>
<p>The Payment Gateway temporarily stores your credit card details while it communicates with the bank for the purpose of completing the transaction. Your credit card details are then purged and not stored long term.</p>
