            <td class="style27">Our Commitment To Privacy<br>
					<br>
					Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your 
					privacy we provide this notice explaining our online 
					information practices and the choices you can make about the 
					way your information is collected and used. To make this 
					notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage 
					and at every point where personally identifiable information 
					may be requested.<br>
					<br>
					The Information We Collect:<br>
					<br>
					This notice applies to all information collected or 
					submitted on this website. On some pages, you 
					can order products, make requests, and register to receive 
					materials. The types of personal information collected at 
					these pages are:<br>
					<br>
					Name<br>
					Address<br>
					Email address<br>
					Phone number<br>
					<br>
					The Way We Use Information:<br>
					<br>
					We use the information you provide about yourself when 
					placing an order only to complete that order. We do not 
					share this information with outside parties except to the 
					extent necessary to complete that order.<br>
					<br>
					We use the information you provide about someone else when 
					placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm 
					delivery. We do not share this information with outside 
					parties except to the extent necessary to complete that 
					order.<br>
					<br>
					We offer gift-cards by which you can personalize a product 
					you order for another person. Information you provide to us 
					to create a gift-card is only used for that purpose, and it 
					is only disclosed to the person receiving the gift.<br>
					<br>
					We use return email addresses to answer the email we 
					receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose 
					and are not shared with outside parties.<br>
					<br>
					You can register with our website if you would like to 
					receive our catalog as well as updates on our new products 
					and services. Information you submit on our website will not 
					be used for this purpose unless you fill out the 
					registration form.<br>
					<br>
					We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better 
					design our website and to share with advertisers. For 
					example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of 
					individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y 
					number of men and Z number of women filled out our 
					registration form, but we would not disclose anything that 
					could be used to identify those individuals.<br>
					<br>
					Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable 
					information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the 
					ones described above without also providing you an 
					opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated 
					uses.<br>
					<br>
					Our Commitment To Data Security<br>
					<br>
					To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and 
					ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place 
					appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures 
					to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.<br>
					<br>
					Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:<br>
					<br>
					Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially 
					important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain 
					information at our website from those we actually know are 
					under 13, and no part of our website is structured to 
					attract anyone under 13.<br>
					<br>
					How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information<br>
					<br>
					You can access all your personally identifiable information 
					that we collect online and maintain by [description of the 
					company access procedure]. We use this procedure to better 
					safeguard your information.<br>
					<br>
					You can correct factual errors in your personally 
					identifiable information by sending us a request that 
					credibly shows error.<br>
					<br>
					To protect your privacy and security, we will also take 
					reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting 
					access or making corrections.<br>
					<br>
					How To Contact Us<br>
					<br>
					Should you have other questions or concerns about these 
					privacy policies, please call us at [phone number] or send

					<br>
					We reserve the right to change this policy at any time. 
					Please check this page periodically for changes. Your 
					continued use of our site following the posting of changes 
					to these terms will mean you accept those changes. 
					Information collected prior to the time any change is posted 
					will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at 
					the time the information was collected.<br>

					This statement and the policies outlined herein are not 
					intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal
