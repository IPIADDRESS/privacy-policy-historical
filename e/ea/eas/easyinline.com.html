            1. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
        <p>
            Yontoo LLC (the "Company," "we" or "us") operates the downloadable browser add- on “EasyInline” (the "App"), which allows you to quickly search terms on your favorite sites. The App, and any other applications, products, services, features, content, promotions or games offered from time to time by the Company at www.easyinline.com (the "Site") or otherwise in connection with its business shall be referred to herein as the "Services". The Company is based in the United States and the Services are hosted in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
            As set forth in the Company's Terms of Service currently available at <a href="#">http://www.easyinline.com/terms-of-service</a>, the Services are general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us through our support page <a href="#">http://www.easyinline.com/contact-us</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including those who use the Services without being registered with the Company and those who have registered with any Company Service. This Privacy Policy describes the Company's collection and use of users' personal information (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address) where that information is not otherwise publicly available on the Services. We also describe generally the Company's practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account. Your access to and use of certain Services may require you to accept additional terms and conditions or a privacy policy applicable to such Services.
        </p>
        <h3>
            2. SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
        </h3>
        <h4>
            User Submitted Information
        </h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Third Party Information and Content.</strong> If you access the Services through a third party connection or log- in, your user submitted information may also include your user name associated with that third party service, any information or content you have permitted the third party to share with the Company, and any information you have made public in connection with that third party service (collectively, "Third Party Information and Content"). Third Party Information and Content obtained in this manner will be governed by this Privacy Policy and the terms and conditions applicable to use of the Services. In addition, the Company may supplement the information we collect with information we obtain from third parties to improve the quality of the Services.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Collected Information
        </h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Transactional and Site Activity Information.</strong> When users access the Services, we collect certain non- personally identifiable information about those visits for marketing purposes. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, operating system and browser, including your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Tracking Technologies.</strong> The Company may use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. These technologies may be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, links you have clicked and advertisements you have seen so that we can serve you more relevant ads when using the Services. The Company may also use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of Services to personal information obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you have asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on the Company Website may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Third Party Collection. Third parties that support the Services by serving advertisements or providing other services, such as providing users with the ability to comment on content, allowing users to share content or tracking aggregate site usage statistics may also use cookies and other tracking technologies described above to collect similar information. The Company does not control these third parties and their use of these technologies is governed by the privacy policies of the third parties using such technologies. For more information about third party ad networks that use these technologies, see <a href="#" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info</a>. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., <a href="#" target="_blank">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies</a>). Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, including cookies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website, see <a href="#" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html</a>. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to the Services or certain features thereof.
