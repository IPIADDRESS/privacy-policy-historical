<h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>EasyWorship.com uses “cookies” to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive. Cookies contain information, including personal information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. The information that cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit, your registration information, session identification number and your navigational history and preferences.</p>
<p>Cookies offer you many conveniences. They allow us to identify registered users when they return to the site so that they can retrieve previous image search results, access lightboxes and view their previous invoices. Cookies also save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information.</p>
<p>In some cases, our third-party service providers may use cookies on our sites. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by EasyWorship.com only, and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies.</p>

<ol>
	<li>limiting access to your personal information to those of our employees who require it to provide services to you;</li>
	<li>protecting credit card information on our order forms using secure socket layer (SSL) technology which encrypts information you input;</li>
	<li>storing your personal information in secure computer systems which protect it from unauthorized access, alteration, or use or destruction of data.</li>
</ol>
<p>We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.</p>
<p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>It is also important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your computer. If a password is used to protect your account and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.</p>
