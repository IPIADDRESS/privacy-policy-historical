		<p class="style27">Our Commitment To Privacy<br>
		<br>
		Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we 
		provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the 
		choices you can make about the way your information is collected and 
		used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our 
		homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information 
		may be requested.<br>
		<br>
		The Information We Collect:<br>
		<br>
		This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on this 
		website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and 
		register to receive materials. The types of personal information 
		collected at these pages are:<br>
		<br>
		Name<br>
		Address<br>
		Email address<br>
		Phone number<br>
		<br>
		The Way We Use Information:<br>
		<br>
		We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order 
		only to complete that order. We do not share this information with 
		outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.<br>
		<br>
		We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an 
		order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share 
		this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to 
		complete that order.<br>
		<br>
		We offer gift-cards by which you can personalize a product you order for 
		another person. Information you provide to us to create a gift-card is 
		only used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person 
		receiving the gift.<br>
		<br>
		We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such 
		addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with 
		outside parties.<br>
		<br>
		You can register with our website if you would like to receive our 
		catalog as well as updates on our new products and services. Information 
		you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you 
		fill out the registration form.<br>
		<br>
		We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our 
		website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an 
		advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our 
		website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our 
		registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used 
		to identify those individuals.<br>
		<br>
		Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information 
		provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above 
		without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise 
		prohibit such unrelated uses.<br>
		<br>
		Our Commitment To Data Security<br>
		<br>
		To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the 
		correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, 
		electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the 
		information we collect online.<br>
		<br>
		Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:<br>
		<br>
		Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For 
		that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website 
		from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is 
		structured to attract anyone under 13.<br>
		<br>
		How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information<br>
		<br>
		You can access all your personally identifiable information that we 
		collect online and maintain by [description of the company access 
		procedure]. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.<br>
		<br>
		You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable 
		information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.<br>
		<br>
		To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps 
		to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.<br>
		<br>

		Changes to this Policy<br>

		this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site 
		following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept
