	Privacy Policy</p><p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana">CHENGDU YIWO Tech 
			Development Co., Ltd's Privacy Policy</font></strong></p>
			<p>
			<font face="Verdana">
			CHENGDU YIWO Tech Development Co., Ltd respects your privacy 
			choices. If you give us personal information, we will treat it 
			according to this policy. What is personal information? Generally, 
			this may include your first and last name, address, e-mail address, 
			and telephone number. If you make a purchase from our site, we will 
			need to collect some information to be used only for 
			the purpose of completing your purchase transaction.<br>
			<br>
			This policy covers the EASEUS web sites. Some of our advertisers, affiliates, or programs have their own, possibly different policies.<br>
			<br>
			CHENGDU YIWO Tech Development Co., Ltd encourages you to read 
			this privacy policy and those of all web sites you visit. Below is a 
			summary of CHENGDU YIWO Tech Development Co., Ltd's online 
			privacy policy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><br>

			Types and uses of information.</font></strong></font></p>
			<p>
			Your privacy is important to us.<br>
			<br>
			<font face="Verdana">
			CHENGDU YIWO Tech Development Co., Ltd</font> is committed to 
			protecting your privacy. Because we collect two types of user 
			information, General Statistical Information and Personal 
			Identifying Information, we are providing you with this policy to 
			inform you of how we use and, in limited circumstances, disclose 
			such information.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Collection, Use and Disclosure of General Statistical Information</b><br>
			<br>
			When you visit our web site we gather certain general information, 
			such as frequency of downloads, number of hits on our web site, and 
			usage statistics with respect to our software products. This 
			information is referred to throughout this policy as "General 
			Statistical Information". We use and store this data only on a 
			collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual 
			basis. This data helps us to determine how and the extent to which 
			certain parts of our web site and software are used. The stored 
			General Statistical Information does not contain any Personal 
			Identifying Information about you or any of our other users.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Collection and Use of Personal Identifying Information</b><br>
			<br>
			In addition to collecting General Statistical Information, we may 
			ask you to provide us with certain personal information, such as 
			your name, street address and email address, to enable us to respond 
			to your requests and needs. Information that can reasonably be used 
			to identify you is referred to in this policy as "Personal 
			Identifying Information".<br>
			<br>
			For example, if you choose a service or transaction that requires 
			payment, such as making a purchase online or through other means 
			such as a purchase order, we will request Personal Identifying 
			Information necessary for payment, invoicing, and/or shipping.<br>
			<br>
			In addition, when you purchase a product, we 
			will also ask for product registration information, which includes 
			the name of the product acquired, as well as your name, street 
			address, and e-mail address. This Personal Identifying Information 
			is kept on file and updated from time to time to fulfill our 
			continuing obligations to you, such as providing notices of new 
			versions and giving support by e-mail.<br>
			<br>
			When you provide us Personal Identifying Information in an e-mail, 
			fax or by telephone such as when you request technical and other 
			types of support, we use the information to locate your records and 
			provide you with answers to your questions.<br>
			<br>
			Also, when you submit information to us in the context of a 
			technical support inquiry, including sending the product 
			error report log file, Personal Identifying Information may be 
			attached to the information submitted.<br>
			<br>
			Please note that you should be aware that the transmitting of the 
			error report log file or other attachments may include confidential 
			information which should be removed prior to the transmittal as we 
			do not accept responsibility for the inadvertent subsequent 
			disclosure of such confidential information. When you ask to be 
			placed on one of our mailing lists, we will use your e-mail address 
			to send you messages relevant to that list.</p>

			<p><strong><font face="Verdana">
			Security measures:<br>
			</font></strong><font face="Verdana">We protect 
			the personal information you share with us. For example, if you make 
			an online purchase with RegNow network, they encrypt your credit card number. 
			Access to your personal information is limited to people who need it 
			to do their job.<br>
			<br>
			Authorized third parties may need access to some of your personal 
			information. For example, if we need to ship something to you, we 
			must share your name and address with a shipping company. We limit 
			such third parties in their access and use of your personal 
			information.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana">We do not 
			otherwise share your personal information with third parties, unless 
			you have granted us permission to do so.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana"><strong>Linked 
			web sites:</strong><br>
			We provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control these 
			web sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on 
			these (and all) third party sites.</font></p>

			Cookies:</strong><br>
			Most EASEUS web sites use
