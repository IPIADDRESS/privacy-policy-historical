American subprime mortgages prior to 2008, southern European sovereign debt in the run-up to 2010 and Japanese banks in the 1980s are but recent examples. So it is worrying that bank lending in emerging markets has ballooned in recent years, from about 77% of GDP in 2007 to 128% at the beginning of this year, according to JPMorgan Chase, a rich-world bank (see chart). That 51-percentage-point jump dwarfs the mere 20-point rise in credit in the rich world in 2002-07. Now that the economic prospects of emerging markets have dimmed, banks from Shanghai to São Paulo are in the spotlight. Trouble in such places would once barely have registered in global financial circles. In 1990 only three of the world’s 100 biggest lenders by assets were in developing countries. Now the world’s four biggest banks are in China, and the fifth-biggest, HSBC, does much of its business from Hong Kong. More than a third of the world’s biggest banks have their headquarters in emerging markets, and plenty of rich-country firms (such as Standard Chartered, based in London, or BBVA, a Spanish bank)...">Stressful times</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21679475-regulation-may-hurt-other-financial-firms-health-insurers-thrive-it-fit?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="     THE past few years have been tumultuous for American health insurers. Barack Obama’s landmark health-care reform spawned a bevy of co-operatives to compete with them, among other measures intended to cut the cost of insurance. More than half of these have already gone bust—most recently Health Republic of New York. It had received $265m in federal loans but closed on December 1st, leaving 200,000 people in search of a new insurer. That is partly because the exchanges on which co-operatives and private insurers alike were supposed to sell lots of new policies have proved a disappointment: last month UnitedHealthcare, America’s biggest health insurer, announced that it may stop selling policies on them. Meanwhile, presidential candidates are demanding tougher government scrutiny of pending industry mergers. The public is hostile too: a survey published in August by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a think-tank, found health insurers were even more disliked than other corporate punchbags, such as banks and airlines.  Yet the share prices of America’s five biggest health insurers—UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Humana, Cigna and...">Fit as fiddles</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21679463-live-longer-work-longer?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="     The state-pension age is no longer set in stone at 65 (or lower). Already 66 in America, it will rise to 67 by 2027. By the end of the 2020s it will also reach 67 in Britain and Germany. But the age at which workers can get full pension benefits and the age at which they retire are not necessarily the same. The effective retirement age is often much younger than the official one. Some older workers are unemployed; others receive disability benefits, private pensions or reduced state pensions under early retirement schemes. Though some money can be saved by raising the pensionable age, public finances will benefit much more if older people stay in work longer, boosting GDP and taxes. Improving health and promoting more flexible ways to work can help make this happen.  Current employment rates among those in their late 60s are typically very low, at 20% on average among the 34 members of the OECD. In many countries simply ensuring that people work until 65 will be an achievement in itself. Although the employment rate of 55-64-year-olds has generally risen in the past decade (Greece and Portugal are exceptions),...">Live longer, work longer</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21679478-unlikely-romance-blossoms-love-and-war?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="     STARTUPS in the world of financial technology, or “fintech”, think of banks as hulking mediocrities ripe for disruption. Banks in turn look down on fintech outfits as little more than gadflies swarming over chicken feed. As any fan of romantic comedies would know, such apparent incompatibility is often the precursor to a close relationship. On December 1st JPMorgan Chase (JPM), America’s biggest bank, announced it would make small-business loans through OnDeck Capital, a “marketplace lender” of the sort that usually claims to be on the verge of putting financial-services behemoths out of business. The deal may seem odd at first: after all, banks like JPM have customers wanting to borrow and the money to lend to them. The catch is that their desire to make smallish loans—the pilot will focus on credits of $250,000 or less—is limited by the cost and hassle of originating them. It is “the kind of stuff we don’t want to do or can’t do,” said Jamie Dimon, JPM’s boss.  OnDeck, whose share price spiked on the news, is one of hundreds of lending platforms active in America.

MANY people take to social media to share news of big events. On December 1st Facebook’s boss, Mark Zuckerberg, followed in the tradition he helped create, when he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced the birth of their daughter on the social-networking site, along with news that they will give away the majority of their fortune during their lifetimes. Around 99% of the shares they own in Facebook, which today are worth around $45 billion, will go into the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI). Their aim, they wrote, is to improve the world for their daughter and future generations. For now, the move allows Mr Zuckerberg to relinquish wealth, but not control, as he will retain the votes associated with any shares transferred to CZI. He anticipates remaining the controlling stakeholder of Facebook “for the foreseeable future”, and plans to sell, or give away, no more than $1 billion of Facebook stock each year for the next three years.

So has this newspaper: it first embraced the idea in 1989. Yet the bitter truth is that the world is nowhere near the sort of carbon-pricing regime that would keep greenhouse gases at tolerable levels. The negotiations under way in Paris this week will not yield one. Economists are used to being ignored, yet the contrast between academics’ enthusiasm for a carbon price and the rest of the world’s disinterest is striking. Carbon prices tackle the problem of emissions head on. When people engage in a carbon-intensive activity, such as driving a car, they impose a cost on others, often without even realising it: the emissions produced when petrol is burned contribute to global warming. Because that cost is not built into the price of petrol, people buy more of it than they otherwise would, atmospheric carbon goes up, and the world bakes. A carbon price that added the missing cost to the price of petrol (and coal and every other carbon-generating activity) would give people an incentive to emit less.

One problem is that some politicians refuse to admit the problem is real. But those who work in the financial markets have to take the issue seriously: ever since being hit by losses from Hurricane Andrew in 1992, insurance companies have been modelling climate risks. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) just weighed in with a 332-page report on their economic and financial impact. A changing climate, and the eventual efforts of governments (however reluctant) to deal with it, could have a big impact on investors’ returns. Companies that produce or use large amounts of fossil fuels will face higher taxes and regulatory burdens. Some energy producers may find it impossible to exploit their known reserves, and be left with “stranded assets”—deposits of oil and coal that have to be left in the ground. Other industries could be affected by the economic damage caused by more extreme weather—storms, floods, heatwaves and droughts. “Investors have to worry about a material and...">Weatherproof</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21679477-despite-jitters-oil-rich-countries-gulf-are-unlikely-devalue-keeping?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="   A currency you can count on  MOST observers expect OPEC to leave production unchanged at its meeting on December 4th. If it does, there will be no end in sight for low oil prices. Saudi Arabia’s strategy of opening the taps to put producers with higher costs out of business is proving painful. Prices are about half what they were a year ago. In 2013 the Gulf countries had a huge combined current-account surplus of 21.6% of GDP. But the IMF expects this to shrink to a deficit of 2.5% of GDP next year, thanks to the plunge in the value of their main export. In October alone, Saudi Arabia’s central bank spent $7 billion of foreign reserves financing the kingdom’s deficit. If it ran short, it would have no choice but to abandon the riyal’s long-standing peg to the dollar. Sure enough, jitters about the peg are discernible in the futures market. On November 24th the price of buying a riyal in a year’s time fell to its lowest level since 2002. Futures for other Gulf currencies have also sagged.  There is little reason for Gulf countries to devalue if they can avoid it.

Now it is about to become a little bit more complicated. Transit fees for the canal are denominated in Special Drawing Rights, a basket of currencies used by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as its unit of account. This week the IMF decided to include the yuan in the basket from next year, joining the dollar, the euro, the pound and the yen. If lots of things were priced in SDRs, the IMF’s decision would have forced companies around the world to buy yuan-denominated assets as soon as possible, to hedge their exposure. That would have prompted China’s currency to strengthen dramatically. But few goods or services are priced in SDRs. Instead, admission to the currency club is significant mainly for its symbolism: the IMF is lending its imprimatur to the yuan as a reserve currency—a safe, liquid asset in which governments can park their wealth.&nbsp;Indeed, far from setting off a groundswell of demand for the yuan, the IMF’s decision may pave the way for its depreciation.

Hungary has been taxing them since 2011. In 2012 the French government introduced a tax on all drinks with added sugar or artificial sweetener, now €0.075 ($0.08) a litre. The Mexican government followed suit last year, with a tax of 1 peso ($0.06) a litre on all sugary drinks. Chile and the city of Berkeley, California introduced similar measures in January; Barbados followed suit in June and Dominica in September. The drinks industry has won some victories too, seeing off proposals for taxes on sugar in several American states and persuading the Slovenian government to backtrack on plans to impose a 10% tax on sweetened drinks last year. In 2013 Denmark repealed its tax on soft drinks and ditched plans for a broader sugar tax.  Governments are adopting the taxes in the hope of trimming bulging waistlines and slowing the rise in diabetes, which cost taxpayers vast sums in spending on health care.
