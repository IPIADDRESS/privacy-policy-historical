AS CASH poured out of China at the start of this year, hedge funds lined up to bet against the yuan. Many thought it only a matter of time before the government ran down its foreign-exchange reserves, forcing a big depreciation. Publicly, Chinese officials scoffed. “Declare currency war against China? Tee hee,” was the front-page headline in a Communist Party newspaper. Privately, they took the threat more seriously. They fought back on multiple fronts, intervening both at home and abroad to prop up the yuan, while tightening capital controls. The battles have gone China’s way so far: it has slowed the outflow of cash and the yuan is right where it found itself in early January. Yet the Chinese authorities’ apparent success prompts two questions. The first, of immediate concern, is whether the stability will endure when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates again. For all China’s forceful actions to prop up the yuan, the biggest factor in its favour was arguably external, as the Fed turned dovish. At the beginning of the year investors were braced for a succession of rate rises in America, believing these would drive the dollar...">Bending, not breaking</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21699939-there-are-more-explanations-solutions-productivity-slowdown-working?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="     ECONOMIC growth stems from two main sources: putting more people to work or enabling workers to operate more efficiently (ie, better productivity). With the workforce in many developed economies likely to stagnate or decline in the next two decades as the baby-boomer generation retires, a lot is riding on improvements in productivity. So the recent progress of productivity in developed economies is cause for severe disappointment. As the chart shows, growth is well below its level in the late 20th century; the brief surge that was seen in places like America and Canada at the time of the dotcom boom has also dissipated. A combination of productivity growth of 1% or so and a stagnant workforce implies very sluggish GDP growth.  A new paper* from the OECD tries to understand this puzzling slowdown in productivity. It cites a number of possible explanations. There is the “progress is over” thesis, for example: that modern advances in information technology are nothing like as revolutionary as the spread of electricity or the car. Another possibility is the shift from a manufacturing to a services economy, where many...">Working hard for the money</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21699942-air-leasing-sector-may-soon-face-harder-times-crowded-skies?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="     EIGHTEEN months of relatively low oil prices have helped many parts of the aviation industry. Cheaper jet fuel has contributed to record profits at airlines in America; the world’s biggest planemakers, Airbus and Boeing, have compiled fat order books thanks to growing demand for air travel. But one part of the industry may be hurt by cheaper oil: leasing firms, which invest in planes and hire them out to airlines and other operators. When oil prices were high, airlines were desperate to replace gas-guzzling planes with new, fuel-efficient ones. Given the daunting commercial outlook, many preferred to lease their new jets, leaving the leasing firms to stump up the capital required to buy planes. Leasing firms are now responsible for about 40% of the big planemakers’ sales.  As a result, leasing has become voguish. Cheerleaders claim that average annual returns have topped 10% in recent years—an astronomical figure in a world of low yields. Investors have been keen to pile in, allowing the leasing firms to raise money for new jets directly by issuing bonds, rather than via bank loans. Boeing forecasts that 53%...">Crowded skies</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21699932-bitcoins-resurgence-may-be-short-lived-etherised?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="     BITCOIN is back. Fans (and holders) of the crypto-currency were celebrating after its price jumped more than 20% in the five days to May 31st, to nearly $550—a level it last reached in August 2014. They should contain their elation: the factors driving the rally are not unalloyed positives, and the competition is doing even better (see chart). Most trading in bitcoin takes place in China: Huobi and OKCoin, two Chinese exchanges, are thought to account for more than 90% of transactions. The currency seems to have become an outlet for Chinese savers frustrated with their limited investment options and searching for high-yielding assets. The Chinese authorities are worried enough to have banned banks from dealing in bitcoin, but individuals are still free to speculate and have been doing so with gusto. Bitcoin’s newfound popularity in China is unlikely to diminish its volatility, however, and thus boost its acceptance as a reliable international payment system.  China has also become the global hub for bitcoin mining, the process by which heavy-duty computing power is used to process transactions involving bitcoin,...">Etherised</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21699931-big-and-tiny-firms-often-find-it-easier-borrow-medium-sized-ones-caught?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="   It takes dough to make bread  THE name of the Grand Global Hotel suggests no want of ambition. But the project ran into financial problems before building work had even finished, says its owner, Emmanuel Tugume. His bank raised interest rates, and would not make allowances for delays in construction. Mr Tugume eventually got a loan from GroFin, a specialist business lender, and now his hotel is thriving. But his experience with Uganda’s banks still rankles. “They do not adjust to people like us,” he says. “They look after the big-time clients.” Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) all over the world grumble about access to finance, but the problem is worse in developing regions. Around two-thirds of SMEs in poor countries cannot borrow as much as they would like, compared with a sixth in the rich world, says the International Finance Corporation, the corporate-lending arm of the World Bank. It put the “credit gap” for small but formal businesses in developing countries at around $1 trillion in 2011. Throw in informal firms, and the shortfall is even greater.

The country is a fortress: a tiny island of prosperity in a troubled region. Its neighbours are hostile; Syria, in the midst of a devastatingly bloody civil war, is a failed state. Israel itself is not only mired in conflict in the Palestinian territories, but riven by internal divisions between observant and secular Jews and between Jews and Arabs. International ire over the treatment of Palestinians leads to calls for boycotts of Israeli goods and divestment from Israeli companies. Yet over the past two decades, this small country, with a population of around 8m, has engineered an economic miracle (see left-hand chart). Israel is testimony to the advantages, and limitations, of fortress economies. Since the 1990s Israel’s economy has been on a tear; between 2004 and 2013 growth in real GDP averaged about 4% a year. Output per person is similar to that in Italy. A nimble tech sector deserves much of the credit.

There is State Bank of India, Union Bank of India, Bank of India and even Central Bank of India (the actual central bank is called the Reserve Bank of India, or RBI). That is because, starting in 1969, the entire financial system was nationalised. Although the government has grudgingly permitted private-sector banks over the past 20 years, the 27 public-sector banks (PSBs), which are listed but majority-owned by the government, still account for 70% of lending. That is a worry, because the PSBs are in terrible shape, having lent freely to companies that cannot pay them back. In response, both the government and the RBI are imposing various reforms—but not the most obvious one. Indian banks dodged the global financial meltdown in 2008. But they promptly embarked on a frenzy of lending to big companies, sowing the seeds of a home-made crisis. The PSBs gleefully funded infrastructure projects that never got the required permits, mines with an output made much less valuable by slumping commodity prices, and tycoons whose main qualification was friendship with...">Bureaucrats at the till</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21699930-reasons-be-less-afraid-about-march-machines-im-afraid-i-cant-do?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="     ARE robots coming to steal our jobs? For those manning the tills at pizza restaurants, the answer seems to be yes. In late May Pizza Hut announced that by the end of the year a robot called Pepper would start taking orders and payment at some of its Asian restaurants, providing a “fun, frictionless user experience”. There is plenty of research to suggest that restaurant workers are not the only ones at risk. One widely cited paper by Carl Frey and Michael Osborne at Oxford University found that as many as 47% of Americans work in jobs that will be highly susceptible to automation over the next two decades. But a new working paper&nbsp;by Melanie Arntz, Terry Gregory and Ulrich Zierahn of the Centre for European Economic Research paints a slightly brighter picture. The earlier study quizzed experts on the chance that a particular occupation could be automated, and then totted up the proportion of American workers in such jobs. But the newer study suggests that this method was too blunt.  Digging into more detailed data, the researchers find that many jobs involve bundles of tasks, only some of which machines can easily handle.

Anything less than 36%, answer American activists who want to curtail payday lending—pricey, short-term credit typically used as an advance on a pay cheque. When the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) unveils its proposals for regulating the industry on June 2nd, it will not set such an interest-rate cap (the Dodd-Frank act, which established the agency, forbids it from doing so). But the regulator will probably impose tough new requirements that could wipe out much of the supply of high-cost, short-term credit. Around 12m Americans turn to payday lenders in any given year. The typical loan is about $350 and costs about $15 every two weeks for each $100 borrowed. At that interest rate, a $100 loan, with both principal and interest rolled over for a year, would explode into a debt of almost $3,800.  The CFPB’s studies of the market make for uncomfortable reading. Nearly half of customers borrow or roll over debt at least ten times per year.

Any meddling with the ¥140 trillion ($1.27 trillion) pot that funds the state pension is politically fraught—as Hiromichi Mizuno, the first chief investment officer of the ultra-conservative Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), is finding out. In October 2014 the GPIF made an historic shift in its asset allocation, trimming its pile of Japanese government bonds and doubling its holding of stocks (see chart). For the next three quarters, its returns duly rose along with stockmarkets. In the financial year that ended on March 31st 2015 the fund made its highest-ever return, of 12.27%. The intention, however, was not so much to juice returns as to prepare for the return of inflation. The Bank of Japan’s massive monetary easing was supposed to be on the verge of pushing prices up again after a decade of deflation, thereby eroding the value of Japanese bonds.
