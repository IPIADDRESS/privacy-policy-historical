Young companies can reduce their bills and so preserve their capital; workers receive a payout which, although deferred and uncertain, is potentially far more valuable than their salary. But there is a hitch: tech firms are taking much longer to list. Their average age at initial public offering (IPO) has risen from four years during the dotcom bubble in 1999-2000 in America to 11 today. That leaves many workers pining for a payday. Inevitably, another bunch of tech startups is trying to develop a solution. In the past, the only means of selling unlisted shares was via an informal broker, who could take months to find a buyer and charge a fee worth 30-40% of the transaction. More recently, demand for Facebook’s pre-IPO shares gave rise to a first wave of secondary markets; SharesPost and SecondMarket were the two largest players.  But the number of American unicorns—private firms valued at more than $1 billion—has since jumped, from 28 in 2013 to 96 today. New secondary-market players, such as EquityZen and Equidate, have emerged, closing deals within weeks and charging...">Trading places</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21702754-workers-benefit-when-firms-must-compete-aggressively-them-hire-power?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="     JOSEPH SCHUMPETER gave the name “creative destruction” to the process by which new and innovative firms displace stodgy ones, thereby driving long-run economic growth. The Schumpeterian sort of economic reinvention is out of fashion at the moment. Unhappy workers are casting their lot with populist politicians, who are in turn looking to rein in the disruption caused by everyone from tech unicorns in Silicon Valley to sellers of cut-price steel in China. Economists understandably worry that this backlash will lead to sweeping new regulations, taxes and protections for firms and workers. But red tape and tax are not the only things that can gum up the economy’s operation. Evidence increasingly suggests that some of what looks like sclerosis across rich countries is in fact rooted in the unequal distribution of gains from growth. When old industries are swept aside by new ones, economists reckon that the resulting gains ought to be large enough to make everyone better off, including the displaced workers. Living standards should rise as new, better and cheaper goods and services become available.

To succeed, they need, among other things, to encourage people to buy cleaner cars and lorries. Around 23% of carbon-dioxide emissions come from transport, of which three-quarters stem from road vehicles, according to the International Energy Agency.  Governments have tried to get drivers to go for greener vehicles. Some have raised the cost of driving by taxing petrol and diesel. Others have taxed the ownership of dirty cars by raising their annual registration fees, or dangled rebates on purchases of greener ones.  Which is the most efficient approach? A new paper by Anna Alberini and Markus Bareit compares policy changes in Switzerland’s 26 cantons to changes in new car sales in each area between 2005 and 2011 as a natural experiment. The least efficient policy was the annual rebate for owning a green car. The authors found this was much less effective than raising the annual registration fees on dirty cars, which had the bonus of raising...">Not easy being green</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21702764-strengthening-economy-creates-dilemma-central-bank-staying-its-hand?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="     BY MOST measures, America’s economy is flourishing. Unemployment is only 4.9%. From April to June payrolls swelled by a healthy 147,000 per month, on average. Consumer confidence is strong and sales of new homes are higher than at any time since 2008. Financial markets have mostly shaken off their early-year worries about Chinese growth and their summer blues over Brexit. Second-quarter growth, due to be revealed after The Economist went to press, was expected to rebound after an underwhelming start to 2016 (mirroring last year). Yet on July 27th, the Federal Reserve opted to hold interest rates in the target range of 0.25%-0.5% for the fifth consecutive meeting. What explains the central bank’s hesitation? One answer is that inflation, according to the measure the Fed targets, is just 0.9%, well below the central bank’s 2% goal. But Janet Yellen, the head of the Fed, has long argued that price rises will pick up as the effect of cheap oil and a strong dollar dissipates. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices (and usually prefigures the headline measure), is 1.6%.

Its opportunities for bombast have shrunk along with its population. And its economic pride has suffered many years of deflation, a form of macroeconomic self-deprecation, in which firms and workers continuously discount what they do. In some fields, however, Japan still allows itself some swagger. It is, for example, happy to describe itself as a “robotics superpower”. In a speech early this year Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, praised a “dream robot suit” made by Cyberdyne as a prime example of the country’s technological advances. The robotic exoskeleton can add strength and stamina to healthy limbs and restore movement to enfeebled ones. As a symbol of Japanese ingenuity in overcoming debility, the suit’s appeal to Mr Abe is easy to understand. Since returning to office in 2012 Mr Abe has strapped Japan into an economic exoskeleton of his own. Dubbed “Abenomics”, his three-piece dream suit includes monetary easing, fiscal pragmatism and structural reform. He claimed it would repel deflation, repair the public finances and revive productivity.

You might think that they would invest in a similar way. But when it comes to American pension funds, you would be wrong. It turns out that public funds have a rather different, and more aggressive, approach to risk from private ones (and indeed from their counterparts in other countries). As a recent paper* by Aleksandar Andonov, Rob Bauer and Martijn Cremers shows, that different approach is driven by a regulatory incentive—the rules that determine how pension funds calculate how much they must put aside to meet the cost of paying retirement benefits. Usually, the bulk of a pension fund’s liabilities occur well into the future, as workers retire. So that future cost has to be discounted at some rate to work out how much needs to be put aside today.  Private-sector pension funds in America and elsewhere (and Canadian public funds) regard a pension promise as a kind of debt. So they use corporate-bond yields to discount future liabilities. As bond yields have fallen, so the cost of paying pensions has risen sharply.

To these can be added the first social-media bank run. Chase Bank Kenya, the country’s 11th-largest (unrelated to America’s JPMorgan Chase), was taken over by regulators in April after word of its impending collapse spread on Twitter and WhatsApp, spurring panicked withdrawals. The run highlighted the risks facing banks in a region that is seen by many investors as one of the industry’s final frontiers. Whereas banks in many rich countries have produced disappointing profits since the financial crisis of 2008, African ones had until recently been reporting stellar growth and juicy returns. Those in Ghana were expanding their loan books at a breathtaking pace of more than 30% a year. Banks in Mozambique, Zambia and Malawi were not too far behind. And most were making good money, too.  Moody’s, a rating agency, reckons that average return on equity (a standard measure of profitability) ranged from 20-25% in many African countries, making their banks well over twice as profitable as American ones and four or five times more profitable than Europe’s limping lenders.

Already, there are around 25 countries with falling headcounts; by the last quarter of this century, projections by the United Nations suggests there may be more than 100. Such a shift seems certain to have a big economic impact, but there is plenty of debate about what that impact might be. After the Black Death a shortage of labour eventually led to a sustained rise in real wages. If that trend were repeated, it would come as a big shift after a prolonged period of sluggish wage growth, something that has fuelled political discontent across the rich world.  A new report on the demographic outlook by Berenberg, a German bank, focuses on one important measure: the dependency ratio. This compares the number of children and the elderly with people of working age (those aged 15-64). The higher the dependency ratio, the greater the burden on the workforce. In the world’s biggest economies, America apart, the workforce is set to shrink significantly (see chart).      ...">Vanishing workers</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21702478-plots-topple-leaders-are-becoming-less-common-thats-good-thing-many?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="     THE attempt last week to overthrow Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, was at once surprising and familiar. Few had thought that the armed forces, however disgruntled, would dare to remove an elected leader who enjoys widespread support. But it was only a short while ago that Turkey suffered a coup every ten years or so, on average. The same can be said for coups around the world. They are almost always unexpected: by their nature, they aim to catch the government unawares. Yet they occur often enough. The past three years have seen successful coups in Egypt and Thailand, along with several botched attempts in other countries. This regularity has yielded a body of research about the causes and consequences of coups, with much of it focused on their economic dimensions. There are no iron laws. Each coup is unique, laced through with political and social complexities. Still, there are certain patterns.  Start with the basic numbers. Jonathan Powell and Clayton Thyne of the University of Kentucky have built a data set of all coup attempts between 1950 and 2010. By their count, there were 457.

This rarefied group, which mainly consists of tech darlings, is about to admit a surprising new member: a large, lumbering Chinese bank. Postal Savings Bank of China, established in 2007, is on course for an initial public offering (IPO) this year that is expected to be the world’s biggest for nearly two years. Its pitch to prospective investors is also unusual. Far from boasting about how well it is run, it instead emphasises the advantages of scale—which it has so far squandered—to imply that it has vast untapped potential. Describing Postal Savings Bank as a startup is something of a misnomer. When it launched nine years ago, it was a spin-off from the Chinese postal service, which had doubled as a quasi-bank for 20 years. As a way of bringing finance to rural areas, the government set up windows at post offices for locals to deposit their savings, a model that lots of other countries had previously followed.
