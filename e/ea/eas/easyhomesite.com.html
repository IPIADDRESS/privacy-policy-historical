It’s people,” says one woman in a World Bank survey. She’s not alone: research has found that social integration is more important for well-being than income, and also decreases poverty. Loneliness, conversely, can be deadly: one study found it did more damage to health than smoking. This week, policymakers from 40 countries met in Colombia to ponder ways to measure deprivation that take account of more than just income, including isolation. Several Latin American countries are devising or have already adopted such “multi-dimensional” measures of poverty. Income can be a misleading measure of need because poor people end up living in different degrees of hardship depending on their intangible resources. Having strong social bonds eases financial deprivation. Friends and relatives can lend money, pool risk, mind children and bring news of job openings. Researchers from the London School of Economics found that when a group of Bangladeshi women were given business training and free livestock, not only did they move up the income ladder, but their friends’ lot improved too. A year later the friends’ consumption had risen by almost 20%, and they claimed to have become savvier about business as well.  The downside is that not having the right friends can cement hardship.

There have been periods of decent economic growth and higher inflation since Mr Abe became prime minister in 2012, but they have not lasted. Japanese GDP is forecast to rise by only 0.8% this year and headline inflation is just 0.6% (the core rate is even lower, at 0.3%). Where Abenomics has clearly made a difference is in the value of the yen. At the end of 2012 it was trading at ¥87 to the dollar; this week, it fell below ¥125, a decline of more than 30% in 30 months (see chart 1). That is down to the Bank of Japan’s massive programme of quantitative easing (QE), which involves creating new yen to buy assets; the Bank is printing ¥80 trillion ($644 billion) a year.       A weaker yen creates two challenges for the rest of the world. First, it makes Japanese exporters more competitive and thus weakens the position of rival exporting nations. That is happening at an especially inconvenient time. Over the past three months, all the main emerging markets bar China and Hong Kong have seen weaker exports than...">Signs of a slowdown</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21653674-why-ge-retaining-one-bit-its-finance-arm-keeping-grease?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="     THE headlines focused on the fact that GE, a big industrial conglomerate, is beginning to sell off its $500 billion finance arm in small chunks. This week it put a $40 billion portfolio of corporate loans up for sale. But not all of GE Capital will end up on the block: GE is keeping the $90 billion division that finances purchases of medical equipment, power-generation gear and aeroplanes, or leases them to users. In part, that is because those fields are critical to GE: it makes all or part of the products being financed or leased. But it is also because the financing of old-fashioned capital goods is a booming business. The gear GE sells is expensive; would-be buyers often lack the capital to buy it outright. For GE, therefore, the financial engineering that underpins the use of its wares is as important as the mechanical engineering that created them. Many hospitals, for instance, do not buy expensive scanners from GE, but lease them instead. When it develops improved versions, it helps the hospitals swap the new generation for the old, by passing the outmoded gear to another, thriftier institution, and so on down a long chain....">Keeping the grease</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21653667-economys-prospects-rest-broken-banks-are-only-slowly-being?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="     IN JULY 1969 India’s embattled prime minister, Indira Gandhi, sacked her finance minister and took the job for herself. The next day she told a senior bureaucrat to take 14 of India’s biggest private banks into public ownership. Nationalisation was cheered in the streets. Banks were seen as servants of rich industrialists that ignored the needs of poor folk. The work of a few hours transformed the prime minister’s political fortunes. These days public-sector banks can scarcely raise a loan, never mind a cheer. Credit growth in India is feeble (see chart 1). A large and growing chunk of the loans advanced to firms during an investment boom that ended in 2012 is turning bad. Problem loans in India’s public-sector banks—those that are six months or more in arrears plus those whose terms have been altered to make repayment easier—were 12% of their assets at the last count (see chart 2). The mess is larger than at privately owned banks and is of greater importance, because public-sector banks account for more than 70% of India’s stock of loans.

There has even been a surge of hope that Greece’s membership of the currency may yet be preserved. But even if a deal is stitched together to keep Greece in, the euro will soon face a broader crisis. The slow growth and strained government finances of recent years will soon be dramatically amplified by demography. And the member facing the most severe onslaught is not a small Mediterranean country but Germany, the euro area’s muscleman. The economic impact of an ageing population is initially positive but ultimately negative. The big generation born after the second world war contributed for many years to higher growth by making the workforce larger, both in absolute terms and relative to the population as a whole.

SeedInvest is a three-year-old company with 20 employees sharing space in a second-tier building near Wall Street. But it has positioned itself to be at the heart of a fundamental change in America’s capital markets. On June 19th Title IV of the JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) Act of 2012 goes into effect. It will change how small companies raise money. Those seeking $20m-50m will be able to offer their shares to the public while skipping some of the most costly regulatory requirements that normally involves, including being vetted by state officials, issuing quarterly reports and listing their shares on an exchange.  In the past, firms that did not meet those requirements could only raise money from investors with a net worth in excess of $1m or $200,000 in annual income. Ten thousand people who did pass that test have signed on to SeedInvest’s system.

Now imagine that the number of these special shopping centres is strictly regulated, giving you a near-monopoly. On top of this you get paid a fee per visitor. No wonder buying airports has become something of an investment fad. Though potentially lucrative, airports tie up a lot of capital, which is why governments around the world are selling them. Some are being listed on stockmarkets, others sold to private investors. The Japanese government is selling 30-40-year concessions to run some of its airports. France is flogging its regional airports: it sold a 49.9% stake in Toulouse airport to a Chinese-led consortium in December.

That is the section of America’s Patriot Act of 2001 that gives the Treasury sweeping powers to act against those who facilitate financial crime, anywhere in the world, by labelling them a “primary money-laundering concern”. For firms badly behaved or unlucky enough to be targeted, a 311 designation is more often than not a death sentence. The latest use of the power, in March, was against Banca Privada d’Andorra, a small money-manager based in the mountainous financial haven nestled between France and Spain. The move in effect shut the bank and its subsidiaries out of America’s financial system, preventing them from concluding any transactions denominated in dollars—an essential function for almost any bank. BPA’s Spanish unit has since been liquidated. The parent has been placed under the control of the Andorran authorities.  FinCEN, the arm of Treasury that handed out the black spot, accuses the bank of aiding money-launderers from China, Russia and Venezuela.

Without a deal, its ability to pay its bills, starting with €300m ($338m) due to the IMF on June 5th, was in doubt. Greek depositors seem to fear that a default might lead the government to shore up the country’s finances by freezing accounts or converting them to a new, less valuable currency. At any rate, since December they have been withdrawing money at a more frenetic pace than at any point in Greece’s long crisis, much of it in cash. That has forced the central bank to print more euro notes.">Stuffing mattresses</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21653682-economists-debate-meaning-contraction-first-quarter-blip-or-blight?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="FOR the world’s largest economy, 2015 has been a series of disappointments. In March builders began construction on just 944,000 new homes, well short of the million or more that had been expected. In April the number of people out of work and claiming benefits exceeded economists’ predictions. And on May 29th official data, which had previously suggested the economy had grown by 0.2% at an annualised rate in the first quarter, were revised to show a contraction of 0.7%. Consumption slowed, investment slid 2.8% and exports dropped by 7.6%. America still accounts for 23% of the world’s output, so a sustained slowdown would have global impact. Happily, most economists offer a comforting explanation: this is all temporary. Start with America’s dreadful weather. Though this year escaped the “polar vortex” (the weather system that dragged down temperatures and output in 2014), it was bitterly cold. Thermometers showed record lows in many eastern cities in February. With streets so icy and air so cold it is no wonder consumption expanded at just 1.8% at an annualised rate, much lower than the 4.4% of the previous quarter.  A simple analysis by Aneta Markowska of Société Générale, a French bank, tracks the correlation between anomalous temperatures and GDP. It suggests that the freeze lowered first-quarter growth by around 1.9 percentage points.
