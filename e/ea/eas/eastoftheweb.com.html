<p>Personal Data collected through this website is controlled by Hyperfiction, a privately owned UK business in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
<p><strong>What data is collected from you?

</strong></p>
<p>Hyperfiction collects data in several ways:

</p>
<p><em>Registration: </em>When you register for the site or during the course of your use of the site, Hyperfiction allows you to enter an email address, a user name and a number of other items of information. All this information is recorded by Hyperfiction.  Note that you are not required and we recommend you do not use your real name when creating a user account user name.</p>
<p><em>Game Scores: </em>Elements of your usage history of certain games may be recorded by Hyperfiction in the form of high score lists and game rankings in your account profile.</p>
<p><em>Submissions: </em>When you submit a piece of work to a Hyperfiction site via email, the email address from which that story was sent and any other email addresses volunteered in the body or attachments of the email are recorded by Hyperfiction. In addition, any other personal data volunteered in the body or attachments of the email or the submission itself may be recorded by Hyperfiction.
</p>
<p><em>Comments and Multiplayer Game Chat: </em>When you add a comment to the site or submit a comment in the chat element of a multiplayer game, any personal data volunteered may be recorded by Hyperfiction.

 Hyperfiction recommends that you take care not to transmit personal information via these channels.</p>
<p><em>Web Logs: </em>Hyperfiction also records information sent by your browser such as your computer's IP address, referring HTTP location, search string, time of the access, browser's time and other statistics for each page accessed. This data may be used anonymously, in an aggregated form to provide statistical information on web page usage.

</p>
<p><em>Tracking Services: </em>Hyperfiction may employ tracking services such as Quantcast or Google Analytics which also record web log information that is used anonymously, in an aggregated form to provide statistical information on web page usage.  Note that this data is collected and stored by the third party.</p>
<p><em>Other: </em>Hyperfiction may ask you for personal data at other times including, but not limited to, competitions, surveys and correspondence with Hyperfiction of which we may keep a record.
</p>

<p>Hyperfiction primarily uses your personal data to administer, moderate and maintain the website and the services available through or in connection with the website.

</p>
<p><em>Author Data: </em>Where users submitting work to a Hyperfiction website volunteer biographical data about themselves in emails relating to submissions, Hyperfiction will make this data available to the users of its sites by publishing it on a relevant site page. Should the submitter request that this biographical data be removed or withheld, Hyperfiction will make every reasonable attempt to comply with the submitter's wishes. Submitters should note that, although data published on the website can be removed from the website itself, Hyperfiction has no control over data that has been downloaded and stored locally by users of the site.</p>
<p><em>Email Data: </em>Where users transmit their email address to Hyperfiction though, for instance, registering at the site or by submitting a story, Hyperfiction may send the user, at the submitted address, occasional information regarding, for instance, changes to the site. Users may make a request to stop receiving this information at any time by emailing Hyperfiction.</p>
<p><em>Registration Data: </em>Any of the information users provide when registering for or using the site (with the exception of their email address and password) will be viewable by anyone visiting the site. In addition, some information about a user's usage of the site (such as game scores and ranks) is viewable to other users of the site.</p>

In addition, information provided in the chat elements of the multiplayer games is also displayed publicly on the site for a period of time and Hyperfiction may store this data for the purposes of moderation.  Hyperfiction recommends that you take care not to transmit personal information via these channels. </p>
<p>Should the submitter request that any personal data transmitted via these channels be removed or withheld, Hyperfiction will make every reasonable attempt to comply with the submitter's wishes.
