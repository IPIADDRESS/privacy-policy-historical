        <h2>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data Under General Data

        <p>If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), Niteo legal basis
          for collecting and using the personal information described in this
          Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Data we collect and the
          specific context in which we collect it.</p>

        <p>Niteo may process your Personal Data because:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We need to perform a contract with you</li>
          <li>You have given us permission to do so</li>
          <li>The processing is in our legitimate interests and it's not

          <li>To comply with the law</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Retention of Data</h2>

        <p>Niteo will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is
          necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will
          retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply
          with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to
          retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes,
          and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>

        <p>Niteo will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes.
          Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time,
          except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to
          improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally
          obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.</p>

        <h2>Transfer of Data</h2>

        <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to —
          and maintained on — computers located outside of your state,
          province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data
          protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.</p>

        <p>If you are located outside Germany and choose to provide
          information to us, please note that we transfer the data,
          including Personal Data, to Germany and process it there.</p>

        <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of
          such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

        <p>Niteo will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your
          data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy
