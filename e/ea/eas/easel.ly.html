</div>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #5a75c7;">Welcome and Introduction</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Welcome to Easel.ly! Easel.ly is an online platform for creating infographics (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”). The Services and the Easel.ly web site (the “<strong>Site</strong>”) are provided by Cuana, LLC, a Washington limited liability company, dba Easel.ly (“<strong>Easel.ly</strong>”).</span></p>
<p>Easel.ly takes seriously the issues surrounding privacy concerns, and is committed to respecting the privacy of our users and their data. This Privacy Policy (the “<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) explains how Personal Information (as defined below) may be collected, used, and disclosed by Easel.ly with to your access and use of this Site. PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SITE OR THE SERVICES. BY ACCESSING THE SITE, CREATING AN ACCOUNT, AND/OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU CONSENT TO THE POLICIES CONTAINED HEREIN.</p>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, when you access and/or use certain features of the Services, your access to or use of such features will also be subject to all guidelines, terms, agreements, and conditions applicable to such features, including third party policies (the “<strong>Policies</strong>”). All such Policies are incorporated into this Privacy Policy by reference, and if the applicability of this Privacy Policy is incompatible with your access to or use of the Services, the relevant terms of such third party Policies will control.</p>
<p>In this Privacy Policy, the use of the words “Easel.ly,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Cuana, LLC, a Washington limited liability company, dba Easel.ly. The words “user,” “you,” and “your” refer to entities or individuals that access and/or use the Site or the Services.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #5a75c7;">Changeability</span></h1>
<p>We reserve the right to change or modify this Privacy Policy and the Services we offer at any time to reflect changes in our practices or keep current with relevant laws or industry standards. We may attempt to notify registered users of material changes by sending an email to the email address you most recently provided us in your account, profile, or registration (unless we do not have such an email address), and/or by posting notice of the changes on the Site. Your access to and/or use of the Site and the Services will be subject to the most current version of this Privacy Policy posted on the Site at the time of your access or use. We recommend that you check the Site from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy, and stay apprised of any other Policies that may be applicable; you are solely responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any modifications to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #5a75c7;">What Is Personal Information?</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means information that you voluntarily submit to us and that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, or email address) or information about that individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal Information can also include information about any transactions, both free and paid, that you enter into on the Site, and information about you that is available on the internet, such as from Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Google, or publicly available information that we acquire from service providers. Personal Information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site and the Services. Our Privacy Policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate information.</span></p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #5a75c7;">What Personal Information Do We Collect?</span></h1>
<p>We collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us including, without limitation, the information you enter when you create an account and profile, send us an email, enter into a subscription agreement or end user license agreement with us, request user support, or submit or post any other content to the Site or use the Services.</p>
<p>We automatically collect certain information when you use the Site and the Services including, without limitation, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring site and your activity on the Site. We also collect information from mobile phone users in a similar manner to optimize the mobile experience. Beyond mobile phone numbers, we collect mobile screen resolution, device make and manufacturer, and may also collect the device’s unique identifier (in the iPhone’s case, a UDID), and, with your permission, your location. We treat this information as Personal Information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.</p>
<p>We may also receive personal information from third parties about their users, and may combine this information with other Personal Information we maintain about you. If we do so, this Privacy Policy will govern the combined information.</p>
<p>We may also receive personal information from users about third parties, and may process this information with other Personal Information we maintain about you for purposes of fulfilling user requests or providing our Services. However, such information is not otherwise stored by us, is not re-used in connection with other user accounts, and is not sold to third parties.</p>
<p>The Site or Services may now or in the future allow users to send messages to each other. These messages may be stored for retrieval at later times in order to facilitate user communication.</p>
<p>The Site or Services may now or in the future allow users to make transactions. Data will be securely stored when a transaction is made, including the date and type of purchase made, your credit card number, expiration date, billing address, and CW or security code number.</p>
<p>Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account or cease use of the Services, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. If you post any of your information to a public area of the Site or the Services, please be aware that it is no longer “Personal Information” for purposes of this Policy, and we or anyone else may use such information without restriction. If you provide access to personal or other information, including your email address or name, to other users through the application of any of our privacy controls or other Service or Site settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Easel.ly has no control over how others may collect, use, or disclose such information.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #5a75c7;">What Aggregated and Non-Personal Information Do We Collect?</span></h1>
<p>We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of the Site and the Services. We also may include web beacons in promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer visitors to our Site to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities.</p>
<p>When you visit the Site, we may assign your computer one or more cookies, to facilitate access to the Site and to personalize your online experience. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on the Site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on the Site. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features offered on the Site or through our Services.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #5a75c7;">Children</span></h1>
<p><u>COPPA Compliance/Children’s Privacy</u>. Easel.ly’s Services are not intended to be used by children without involvement and approval of a parent or guardian. If you are under the age of 18 years of age, you may register with Easel.ly or provide your personal information to Easel.ly only if you have the consent of your parent or legal guardian. Only if you are a subscriber over the age of 18 may you grant access to the Services to your minor children or those for whom you are guardian or responsible (“child”) and, by doing so, you agree that (a) Easel.ly may provide the Services to and collect personal information provided by your minor child and (b) you and your child will be bound by and comply with this Privacy Policy and the Easel.ly <a href="https://www.easel.ly/blog/privacy-policy/">Terms of Use</a>&nbsp;. You may withdraw your consent by notifying us in writing at support@easel.ly. Easel.ly does not collect personal information from minor children without such consent. As noted, you provide consent by registering your child for the Services and, in that case, will only use the information associated with such account to provide the Services and as outlined in this Privacy Policy. You may review the personal information your child has supplied to us and modify or correct it and, upon your written request and subject to the caveat below, we will delete the personal information your child has provided to us. We will delete all of your child’s personal information (and yours) when your subscription ends. We will never request personal information from your child in any of our public posting areas and we will not require your child to provide more personal information than is necessary to provide the Services you have authorized your child to use. PLEASE REMIND YOUR CHILD NEVER TO PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION ON THIS SERVICE OR ANY OTHER SITE WITHOUT FIRST GETTING YOUR CONSENT. If at any time Easel.ly learns that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personal information to its online sites, we will take all reasonable measures necessary to remove such information from Easel.ly’s databases and not use such information for any purpose except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others or as required by law.</p>
<p><u>FERPA Compliance</u>. With regard to school-based activities, COPPA allows teachers and school administrators to act in the stead of parents to provide consent for the collection of personal information from children. Schools should always notify parents about these activities.

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #5a75c7;">Your Control</span></h1>
<ul>

</ul>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #5a75c7;">Links to Other Sites</span></h1>

If we become aware of a security systems breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically using the contact information we have available so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may post a notice through the Services if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to access the Services. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to use in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p>
<p>Users should also be aware of how they handle and disclose their Personal Information and should avoid sending Personal Information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at <u>http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shm</u> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>
