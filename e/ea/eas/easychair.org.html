Use of Personal Information by Conference Organizers</h1><p>We collect data that is normally required by conference organizers. This
       is your name, email address, address for correspondence, Web page,
       country, affiliation, or phone number.</p><h1>2. Cross-Conference Data</h1><p>We do not pass any personal cross-conference data. For example, when
         you submit a paper, we will not pass information on whether this or a
         similar paper has been submitted before or in parallel.  We will never
         pass any information about reviewing in one conference to organizers of
         another conference, even if both are different instances of the same
         conference series.</p><p>Note, however, that we cannot prevent conference organizers from
         passing this information.</p><h1>3. Use of Personal Information by EasyChair</h1><p>This section covers our policy on handling your data for uses other
         than the use by conference organizers as described in Sections 1 and
         2. Exceptions to this policy are described in Section 4.</p><ol><li>We do not sell, distribute, or pass your personal data to any
             organization.</li><li>We do not access data of any conference that uses EasyChair.
             Our policy is that <i>the only persons who have access to
             this data are those persons who have access to it as a
             consequence of their use of EasyChair</i>. For example, if we store a review on a submission for a
             conference, only the following people will have access to this
             review:</li><ol><li>the reviewer who wrote the review;</li><li>the chairs of the conference;</li><li>the program committee member who is handling the review;</li><li>all program committee members to which the chairs give
                access to the review;</li><li>the authors of the submission if the chairs decide to send the
                review to the authors, and only after the review has been sent
                to the authors.</li></ol></ol><h1>4. Abuse of Services Provided by EasyChair.</h1><p>We reserve a right to interfere in conference management or access
         personal or conference information in the following cases:</p><ol><li>We have reports on a substantial abuse of EasyChair, for example
             (a) its use for sending unsolicited email not related to the
             intended use or (b) use of the EasyChair submission facilities for
             anything different from its intended use by conference
             organizers.</li><li>Our security features report on attacks on EasyChair or on repeated
             attempts to access data in unauthorized ways</li></ol><p>In any such case of reported abuse our interference in conference
         management or personal information will only be exercised to the extent
         required to investigate the problem.</p></div></div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="footer">Copyright © 2002-2018 EasyChair</td></tr></tbody></table>
