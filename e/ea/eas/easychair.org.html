Use of Personal Information by Conference Organizers</h1><p>We collect data that is normally required by conference organizers. This
       is your name, email address, address for correspondence, Web page,
       country, affiliation, or phone number.</p><h1>2. Cross-Conference Data</h1><p>We do not pass any personal cross-conference data. For example, when
         you submit a paper, we will not pass information on whether this or a
         similar paper has been submitted before or in parallel.  We will never
         pass any information about reviewing in one conference to organizers of
         another conference, even if both are different instances of the same
         conference series.</p><p>Note, however, that we cannot prevent conference organizers from
         passing this information.</p><h1>3. Use of Personal Information by EasyChair</h1><p>This section covers our policy on handling your data for uses other
         than the use by conference organizers as described in Sections 1 and
         2. Exceptions to this policy are described in Section 5.</p><ol><li>We do not sell, distribute, or pass your personal data to any
             organization.</li><li>We do not access data of any conference that uses EasyChair.
             Our policy is that <i>the only persons who have access to
             this data are those persons who have access to it as a
             consequence of their use of EasyChair</i>. For example, if we store a review on a submission for a
             conference, only the following people will have access to this
             review:</li><ol><li>the reviewer who wrote the review;</li><li>the chairs of the conference;</li><li>the program committee member who is handling the review;</li><li>all program committee members to which the chairs give
                access to the review;</li><li>the authors of the submission if the chairs decide to send the
                review to the authors, and only after the review has been sent
                to the authors.</li></ol></ol><p>For nearly all services provided by EasyChair data
         controllers are our users: conferences, reviewers, authors
         and registrants. The exceptions are EasyChair services related to
         publishing (publications, EasyChair Preprints and Smart CFP), where you
         give us an explicit consent to publish.</p><p>The following information is collected by or on behalf of EasyChair and
         is necessary for providing our services:</p><ol><li>Account data: we collect information when you create or update your
             EasyChair account. This include your name, email, organization,
             country, login name and password (which is stored encrypted). You
             can also optionally provide your address and phone number.</li><li>When you make payments through EasyChair, payment information and
             history to the extent allowed by PCI security standards (for
             example, we do not store credit card numbers).</li><li>When you use our publishing services, information about authors,
             editors, managers and the published content.</li><li>We may collect information about IP addresses you use to access our
             services.</li><li>We may collect information about how you interact with our
             services. This includes information such as access dates and times
             and published information you access. In some cases, we collect
             this information through cookies.</li><li>We store the list of your co-authors and co-reviewers
             (associates). This list can be edited by you.</li><li>We store the history of your customer support requests.</li><li>We store the list of conferences you manage and your roles in these
             conferences.</li></ol><h1>4. Cookies</h1><p>The EasyChair Web Site uses cookies. A cookie is a small file of
         letters and numbers that we put on your computer if you agree. These
         cookies allow us to distinguish you from other users of the EasyChair
         Web Site, which helps us to provide you with a good experience when
         you browse the EasyChair Web Site and also allows us to improve the
         EasyChair Web Site.</p><p>The use of cookies is necessary for secure user authentication. We only
         use secure cookies.</p><p>We do not use third party cookies on our Web pages and thus do not
         allow third party services to collect information about your use of
         EasyChair.</p><h1>5. Abuse of Services Provided by EasyChair.</h1><p>We reserve a right to interfere in conference management or access
         personal or conference information in the following cases:</p><ol><li>We have reports on a substantial abuse of EasyChair, for example
             (a) its use for sending unsolicited email not related to the
             intended use or (b) use of the EasyChair submission facilities for
             anything different from its intended use by conference
             organizers.</li><li>Our security features report on attacks on EasyChair or on repeated
             attempts to access data in unauthorized ways</li></ol><p>In any such case of reported abuse our interference in conference
         management or personal information will only be exercised to the extent
         required to investigate the problem.</p></div></div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="footer">Copyright © 2002-2019 EasyChair</td></tr></tbody></table>
