   EasyRecipeSite.com</span></b></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate
our firm and continuing commitment to the privacy of personal information provided by those visiting and
interacting with this web site. We hold the privacy of your personal information in the highest regard.
      <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We never sell your personal information to third
      parties.</span> The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this
      website.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We recognizes the importance of protecting your
privacy</span></b> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">and our policy is designed to assist you in
understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in
making informed decisions when using our site. This policy will be continuously assessed against new technologies,
business practices and our customers' needs.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Log Files<br>
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files.&nbsp; The information in the log
files include&nbsp; your IP (internet protocal) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw
Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our
site and which pages you visited throughout our site.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Cookies and Web Beacons<br>
We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site.&nbsp; This could
include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as
forums.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We also use third party advertisements on to support our
site.&nbsp; Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our
site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information
including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have
Flash installed.&nbsp; This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to
someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking
ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies
or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet
Security.&nbsp; However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other
websites.&nbsp; This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or
accounts.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">What Are Cookies?</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br>
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web
site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive
specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's
preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it
has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies.
However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse
cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not
function as effectively when viewed by the users.</span> <b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">A
cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</span></b></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">How Do We Use Information We Collect from
Cookies?</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br>
As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases,
we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in
conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web
site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly improve our Web site
and better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not
intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to us in your cookies.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">IP Addresses</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br>
IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number
that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our
web server as part of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you
request) can be sent to you.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Sharing and Selling
Information</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br>
We <b>do not</b> share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as
email addresses or personal details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process transactions or
provide services that you have requested.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">How Can You Access and Correct Your
Information?</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br>
You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our
database by emailing us at the usual address.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of
Information?<br></span></b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We may disclose information when
legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the
protection of our legal rights.</span> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We may also disclose
account information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify,
contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of
our users and the Public.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web
Site?</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br>
We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site or the information or
content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics
that may be useful to the users of our Web site.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break">
<br style="mso-special-character: line-break"></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Please remember that when you use a link to go from our
Website to another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other
web site, including web sites, which have a link on our Website, is subject to that Web site's own rules and
policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Your Consent</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br>
By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this
Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or without
notice.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em><b><span style="FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Our Commitment To Data
Security:</span></b></em></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Please note that your information will be stored and processed
on our computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United States may be less stringent
than the laws of your Country of residence or citizenship.</span> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the
correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to
safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out<br></span></b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">If we have any type of opt-in or mailing list you have joined, this site
allows visitors to unsubscribe so that they will not receive future messages. After unsubscribing we will
discontinue sending the particular messages as soon as technically feasible.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Surveys &amp; Contests</span></b></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">From time-to-time our site may request information from users
via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore
has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information
(such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information
will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or
improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">A Special Note About Children</span></b></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Children are not eligible to use our services</span>
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">unsupervised and we ask that children</span> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(under the age of 14) do not submit any personal information to us. If you
are a minor, you can use this service only in conjunction with permission and guidance from your parents or
guardians. Otherwise, please leave this website now.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Acquisition or Changes in Ownership</span></b></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In the event that the web site (or a substantial portion of
its assets) is acquired, your information would be considered part of those assets, and may be part of those assets
that are transferred.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Policy Modifications<br></span></b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes
here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the
future, we will not use the personal information you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a manner
that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent.</span></p>
