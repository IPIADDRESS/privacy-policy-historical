<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm and continuing
commitment to the privacy of personal information provided by those visiting and interacting with this web site. We hold the privacy of your
personal information in the highest regard. <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We never sell your personal information to third
parties.</span> The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We recognizes the importance of protecting your privacy</span></b> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">and our policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal
information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site. This policy will be continuously assessed
against new technologies, business practices and our customers' needs.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Log Files<br>
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files.&nbsp; The information in the log files include&nbsp; your IP
(internet protocal) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as
Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Cookies and Web Beacons<br>
We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site.&nbsp; This could include only showing you a
popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We also use third party advertisements on to support our site.&nbsp; Some of these
advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as
Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some
cases, whether you have Flash installed.&nbsp; This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in
New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking
sites).</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your
browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.&nbsp; However, this can affect how you are able to
interact with our site as well as other websites.&nbsp; This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into
forums or accounts.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What Are Cookies?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks
your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own
cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the
cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would
prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse
cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the users.</span> <b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</span></b></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent
you from having to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the
aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly
improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not
intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to us in your cookies.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">IP Addresses</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the
network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as
traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Sharing and Selling Information</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
We <b>do not</b> share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal
details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process transactions or provide services that you have requested.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us at the
usual address.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?<br></span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith,
believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights.</span> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We may also
disclose account information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal
action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the Public.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site or the information or content contained therein.
Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web
    site.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break">
<br style="mso-special-character: line-break"></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to another web site, our
Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other web site, including web sites, which have a link on our
Website, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Your Consent</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the
right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or without notice.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Our Commitment To Data Security:</span></b></em></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Please note that your information will be stored and processed on our computers in the
United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your Country of residence or
citizenship.</span> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the
correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
information we collect online.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out<br></span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">If
we have any type of opt-in or mailing list you have joined, this site allows visitors to unsubscribe so that they will not receive future
messages. After unsubscribing we will discontinue sending the particular messages as soon as technically feasible.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Surveys &amp; Contests</span></b></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">From time-to-time our site may request information from users via surveys or contests.
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this
information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip
code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of
monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">A Special Note About Children</span></b></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Children are not eligible to use our services</span> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">unsupervised and we ask that children</span> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">(under the
age of 14) do not submit any personal information to us. If you are a minor, you can use this service only in conjunction with permission and
guidance from your parents or guardians. Otherwise, please leave this website now.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Acquisition or Changes in Ownership</span></b></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">In the event that the web site (or a substantial portion of its assets) is acquired, your
information would be considered part of those assets, and may be part of those assets that are transferred.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Policy Modifications<br></span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We
may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, please be
assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal information you have submitted to us under this Privacy
Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent.</span></p>
