easyDNS does not in any way share the personal information that you have included in the personal information
section of your easyDNS member pages. Your information is neither sold nor rented to any third party or
information collection organization and is used solely for the administration of your easyDNS account.
</p>

<br>
<p>
<span class="boldpurplrg">Your easyDNS membership information:</span>
</p>

<p>
The information collected by easyDNS, including name, address, company name, email address, phone number and
fax number, is used to validate the authenticity of requests made by individuals or organizations with respect
to information contained in their easyDNS account, or in response to a lost password or lost user ID issue. We
may also use the information to contact members with important system or account information, changes to
services, and other important easyDNS updates. With the members permission we may also use the information to
provide updates on new services and other special announcements.
</p>

<p>
The answers supplied to the secret questions selected during the sign up process may be used in concert with personal
email addresses and phone numbers to assist easyDNS members in the generation of new passwords during the automated password recovery process. The questions and answer pairs may also be used by easyDNS support staff to authenticate various requests by our members made directly via email and telephone. 
</p>

<p>
Personal information that exists within an easyDNS account will remain active until the member has
requested that the account be deleted or until the account and the information contained within has been deleted
during the routine deletion of dormant and unused easyDNS member accounts.
</p>

<br>
<p>
<span class="boldpurplrg">Public Whois information:</span>
</p><p>

</p><p>
All registered domain names are required by ICANN to contain accurate, publicly accessible whois information
including the names, address and telephone numbers of all listed contacts.
</p>

<p>
easyDNS members may choose to use their personal information as the public whois information for domain names
registered with easyDNS. However, whois information is not private information and cannot be protected by
easyDNS under this privacy policy.
</p>

<p>
For an example of what Whois information looks like please visit <a href="http://www.easywhois.com">easyWhois</a>
and perform a Whois lookup on "easyDNS.com".

<span class="boldpurplrg">Our Use of Cookies</span>
</p>

<p>
We do not collect personal information without your knowledge and permission,
nor do we resell or distribute any site visitor data, including information
that may be collected as a natural by-product of your visit.
</p>

<p>
For general information on what cookies are and what they can and can't do for
you, take a quick look at our <a href="#cookiefaq">Cookie FAQ</a> below.
</p>

<p>
The widespread concern about cookies has very little to do with the technology
and very much to do with the fear that unscrupulous site operators might use
cookies for unacceptable practices.
</p>

<p>
easyDNS™ only uses cookies to remember certain things about you between
visits to our site, and as you move between pages on the site. We also use cookies
to administer our Member Rewards program, identifying which member should be
credited for a referred sale.
</p>

<p>
Our Web site utilizes cookies in order to provide you with a better experience.
For security reasons (even though only we can read the cookies we send you),
easyDNS™ will only store a unique identifying number in the cookie we send.
We never store your username, password, credit card information, or any other
personal information about you in our cookie.

<span class="boldpurplrg">Cookie FAQ</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="boldpurpital">What is a cookie?</span><br>
A cookie is a very small text file placed on your hard drive by a website.
</p>


<p>
<span class="boldpurpital">Why use cookies?</span><br>
Cookies are the easiest way to tell the website you are visiting that you have
returned. They also provide a way to store information about you between visits.
</p>

<p>
<span class="boldpurpital">Are they harmful?</span><br>
No. Here are a list of things that a cookie <b>can't</b> do:
</p><ul>
<li>it can't deliver viruses to your computer
</li><li>it can't be read by any website other than the one that gave it to you
</li><li>it can't allow us to read files or sensitive information on your hard drive
</li><li>it can't reveal personal information about yourself, where you live, what your
income is, or any other piece of personal information that you don't explicitly
provide
</li></ul>

<p>
<span class="boldpurpital">Where can I find more information on cookies?</span><br>
A search for "internet cookies" or "persistent cookies" on
any search engine should provide a wealth of links to more information. <a href="http://dmoz.org">dmoz</a>
has a fairly comprehensive list of some of the best resources.
