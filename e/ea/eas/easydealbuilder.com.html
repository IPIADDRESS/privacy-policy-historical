When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register 
your purchase electronically. When you do, we merge your 
registration information with any information you've already left 
with us (we call that information your personal profile). If you 
haven't previously registered with us, we create a personal profile

so. This ensures that only you can access your information.<br>

profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification 
username, which helps us ensure that only you can access your

When you register, you create your profile, your username and 
password. It is your passport to seamless travel across your member 
area, allowing you to download software and order more plug-in 
modules without having to fill out registration forms with 
information you've already provided. Even if you switch computers, 
you won't have to re-register – just use your Registration ID to 
identify yourself. <br>
<br>
<b>WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION YOU SHARE</b><br>
When you join us, you provide us with your contact information, 
including your name and email address. We use this information to 
send you updates about your order, questionnaires to measure your 
satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and 
exciting services that we offer. When you order from us, our 3rd 
party payment processors such as PayPal ask for your credit card 
number and billing address. They use this information only to bill 
you for the product(s) you order at that time. <br>
<br>
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on 
our behalf, including programming, answering customer questions 
about products or services, sending email and processing event 
registration. We will only provide those companies the information 
they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using 
that information for any other purpose.<br>
