					<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">What Are 
					Cookies?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">
					<br>
					A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes 
					an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, 
					that site's computer asks your computer for permission to 
					store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically 
					designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own 
					cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow 
					it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits 
					a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, 
					not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are 
					usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer 
					not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of 
					your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your 
					browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of 
					our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the 
					users. </span><b>
					<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">A cookie 
					cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass

					<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">How Do We 
					Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">
					<br>
					As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies 
					to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we 
					also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more 
					than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with 
					our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the 
					aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which 
					parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather 
					feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better serve 
					our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal 
					information about you and we do not intentionally store any 
					personal information that your browser provided to us in 
					your cookies. </span></p>

					<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">IP

					<br>
					IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are 
					connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that 
					is used by computers on the network to identify your 
					computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our 
					web server as part of demographic and profile data known as 
					“traffic data” so that data (such as the Web pages you
