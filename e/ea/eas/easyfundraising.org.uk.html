			<strong>Transferring information abroad or to others

			We do not transfer information outside the EEA unless we need to
        transfer information abroad specifically to ensure that the service you
        seek is properly provided to you where that service is provided in
        whole or in part from abroad.
		</p>
	</div><div>
		<p>
			Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a
        similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one
        of the following safeguards is implemented:
		</p>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
				We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have
                been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for
                personal data by the European Commission.
				</li>
				<li>
				Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific
                contracts approved by the European Commission which give
                personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
				</li>
				<li>
				Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to
                them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them
                to provide similar protection to personal data shared between
                the Europe and the US.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<p>
					<br>
					If we sell or otherwise dispose of the site, our business, or part
            of it in any way, the information will go with it but we will seek
            similar safeguards for you as these.

				<strong>Your Rights
				</strong>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				You have the right to:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject
        access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal
        data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.&nbsp;You can request a
copy of your data via the ‘Easyfundraising Data’ section of the ‘
				<a href="https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/account/settings/">My Account</a>’
area.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				<strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This
        enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you
        corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data
        you provide to us.&nbsp;You can correct the
data you have supplied to us in the '
				<a href="https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/account/settings/">My Account</a>' area of the website.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				<strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to
        delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us
        continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete
        or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your
        right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed
        your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your
        personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not
        always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific
        legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time
        of your request. We delete all personal information collected in
        relation to Supporters and Good Causes if the data subject cancels
        his/her registration with the Website, although we may retain such
        information in anonymised form. You may request that we delete your
        account and all information relating to your account by using the
        Delete Your&nbsp;Account functionality in the 'Easyfundraising Data' area of&nbsp;the
				<a href="https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/account/settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">'My Account'</a>
				section of the website or sending an email to us at 
				<a href="mailto:support@easyfundraising.org.uk?subject=DELETE%20ACCOUNT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
				support@easyfundraising.org.uk
				</a>
				with the heading 'DELETE ACCOUNT'.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				<strong>Object to processing </strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a
        legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something
        about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
        processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental
        rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are
        processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some
        cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to
        process your information which override your rights and freedoms.&nbsp;Options for managing
this can be found in the 'Preferences' section of the '
				<a href="https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/account/settings/">My Account</a>' area.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				<strong>Request restriction </strong> of processing of your personal data. This enables
        you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the
        following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's
        accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want
        us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no
        longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal
        claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to
        verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.&nbsp;Options for managing this can be found in the 'Preferences' section of the '
				<a href="https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/account/settings/">My Account</a>' area.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party.
        We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal
        data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that
        this right only applies to automated information which you initially
        provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to
        perform a contract with you.&nbsp;You can request a
copy of your data via the ‘Easyfundraising Data’ section of the ‘
				<a href="https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/account/settings/">My Account</a>’
area.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				<strong>Withdraw consent</strong> at any time where we are relying on consent to process
        your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any
        processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you
        withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products
        or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time
        you withdraw your consent.

		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
        exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable
        fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
        Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these
        circumstances.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm
        your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to
        exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to
        ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no
        right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further
        information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
        Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is
        particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
        case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
