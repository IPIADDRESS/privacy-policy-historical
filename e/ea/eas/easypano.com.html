<ol>
  <li><b>Easypano's commitment regarding disclosure of member information</b><br>
    Easypano will not share member information with third parties without permission.<br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Product activation and privacy</b> </li>

  The Easypano Product Activation System does not collect or utilize personal 
  information, such as your name and contact information. Product Activation is 
  completely secure and anonymous. No personal information is ever collected or 
  requested. During activation, the product does not scan your hard drives or 
  collect any data other than the minimum information required to verify your 
  license.<br>

    You can unsubscribe from any email list at any time from Easypano Newsletter.</li>

<p class="ptitle">Easypano Privacy Policy 
</p><p class="ptitle">&nbsp;
</p><p><span class="psmalltitle">Information Collection and Use </span> <br>
  Easypano is the sole owner of the information collected on this Web site. Any 
  information collected from our users will not be sold, shared, or rented to 
  others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 
</p><p><span class="psmalltitle">Easypano Member and Product Registration<br>
              </span> You will become a Easypano member automatically when you 
              successfully order a product on Easypano Website. An Email with 
              your login Email and password will be sent to you once we receive 
              your order. However, if you order products from our distributors 
              and resellers, you have to register as an Easypano member by registering 
              a product with information such as Email address, your first name, 
              last name, product serial number and license key. This data is used 
              to provide information about the services on our site for which 
              the user has expressed an interest. It is optional for the user 
              to give demographic information, but encouraged, so that we can 
              provide a more tailored experience on our site. To confirm registration, 
              we send all new members and product registrants a welcoming e-mail. 
            </p><p><span class="psmalltitle">Online Purchases</span> <br>
              We use an outside company, element 5, to ship orders and process 
              credit cards. This company does not retain, share, store or use 
              personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.<br>
              On our order form, a user is asked to provide contact information 
              (e.g. name and address) and payment information (e.g. credit card 
              number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes, 
              to fill customer's orders and, if the customer chooses, may be used 
              for future promotional offers. If we have trouble processing an 
              order, this contact information will be used to get in touch with 
              the user. 
            </p><p><span class="psmalltitle">Cookies </span> <br>
              A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing 
              information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in NO WAY linked 
              to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once 
              the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. <br>
              Cookies provide a more tailored and convenient experience for users. 
              For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not 
              have to login more than once, thereby saving time. Cookies can also 
              enable us to track and target the interests of our users to further 
              enhance the experience on our site. Rejecting a cookie will limit 
              users to some areas of our site. 
            </p><p><span class="psmalltitle">Log Files </span><br>
              We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track 
              user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate 
              use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.  <br>             
            </p><p> <span class="psmalltitle">Sharing </span><br>
              We will ONLY share aggregated demographic information with our partners 
              and advertisers. This is NOT linked to any personal information 
              that can identify any individual person. <br>
              As mentioned above, an outside company called Element 5 processes 
              online orders. This company does not retain, share, store or use 
              personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.<br>
              Sometimes we partner with another party to provide specific services. 
              When the user signs up for these specific services, we will share 
              ONLY information that is necessary for the third party to provide 
              these specific services. These third parties are not allowed to 
              use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of 
              providing these services.<br>
            </p><p><span class="psmalltitle">Links</span><br>
              This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that 
              we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. 
              We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and 
              to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects 
              personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies 
              solely to information collected by this Web site. 
            </p><p><span class="psmalltitle">Newsletters<br>
              </span> If a user wishes to subscribe to our Newsletters, we only 
              ask for the user's e-mail address. <br>
            
            </p><p><span class="psmalltitle">Surveys &amp; Contests<br>
              </span> From time-to-time our site will request information from 
              users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or 
              contests is completely voluntary, and, therefore, the user has the 
              choice of whether or not to disclose such information. Information 
              requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping 
              address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). 
              Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award 
              prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring 
              or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 
            </p><p><span class="psmalltitle">Trial Downloads<br>
              </span> Many Easypano products have trial software available for 
              downloading. During the trial download process, the user has a choice 
              to opt-in or -out of certain options. For example, these may include 
              the option to receive occasional Easypano product news and special 
              offers via e-mail. 
            
</p><p><span class="psmalltitle">Security</span><span class="psmalltitle"> </span><br>
              This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. 
              When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information 
              is protected both online and off-line. <br>
              <br>
              When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information 
              (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that 
              information is protected with the best encryption software in the 
              industry: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). While on a secure page, such 
              as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such 
              as Netscape? Navigator and Microsoft? Internet Explorer becomes 
              locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 
              To learn more about SSL, follow this link <a href="http://www.verisign.com/site/ssl.html" target="_blank">http://www.verisign.com/site/ssl.html</a> 
              <br>
              <br>
              At Easypano, we also do everything in our power to protect user 
              information off-line. All of our users' information remains confidential 
              in our offices. Only a selected number of employees who need the 
              information to perform a specific job (e.g. a customer service representative) 
              are granted access to personally identifiable information. These 
              employees must also use password-protected screen-savers when they 
              leave their desk. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up to date 
              on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as 
              any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or 
              reminded about the importance we place on privacy and what they 
              can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, 
              the servers on which we store personally identifiable information 
              are kept in a secure environment, behind locked doors.<br>
              <br>
              If you have any questions about the security on our Web site, you 
              can send an e-mail to <a href="/contactus.html">Easypano</a>. 
            </p><p><span class="psmalltitle">Special Offers<br>
              </span> Due to their request, established members will occasionally 
              receive information about products, services, special deals, and 
              a News Flash. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we provide 
              the option to discontinue these types of communications. For more 
              details, please see the Choice/Opt-out paragraph below. <br>
              Modifying/Updating Personal Information<br>
              If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as 
              the postal code) or if a user no longer desires our service, we 
              provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal 
              data. This is done at the member information page. 
            </p><p> <span class="psmalltitle">Choice/Opt-out<br>
              </span> Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional 
              materials may opt-out of receiving these communications by modifing 
              your mailing status<a href="/newsletter.html"> 
              here</a>. 
            </p><p><span class="psmalltitle">Notification of Changes<br>
              </span> If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post 
              those changes on our home page so our users are always aware of 
              what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, 
              if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally 
              identifiable information in a manner different from that stated 
              at the time it was collected, we would notify users by way of an 
              e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their 
              information in this different manner. We will use information in 
              accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was 
              collected. </p>
