<p><a id="contact" name="data"></a></p>
<h2>2. WHAT KIND OF DATA ARE PROCESSED? WHAT ARE THE PURPOSES OF THE DATA PROCESSING?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, the visit and consultation of the Website does not imply collection and processing of user’s personal data. The processing of user’s personal data that visits and consults the Website is limited to the so-named surfing data, namely the data whose transmission to the Website is implicit in the functioning of the information systems in charge of the managing of the Website and in the use of communications protocols peculiar to the Internet. Surfing data are, for example, the IP addresses or the domain names of the computers employed by the user who connects to the Website and other parameters relating to the type and the information operating system employed by the user. Surfing data, such as these above specified and for example the number of visits, the time spent on the Website are collected and processed by VF exclusively for statistical purposes and in anonymous form in relation to the access and use of the Website for purposes of monitoring the correct functioning of the Website and enhancing the Website functioning and content. Due to the nature itself of surfing data, these data may lead to identification of users if they are associated with data held by third parties; however, VF does not collect surfing data in order to associate them with identified users. Surfing data are deleted after the processing in anonymous form; said data may be used for purposes of assessing possible responsibilities in case of information crimes realized against the Website or through the Website. With the exception of the aforementioned circumstance, VF keeps the user’s surfing data only for the maximum period of time allowed under applicable laws and then makes said data anonymous.
