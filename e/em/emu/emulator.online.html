We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to our Site, is subject to that website’s own terms and policies.</p><h2 id="advertising">Advertising</h2><p>Ads appearing on our site may be delivered to Users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.

This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous – so we don’t know who you are; just that somebody visited our site.</p><p>The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better.</p><p>You can learn more about <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">Google Analytics</a> or <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">opt out if you wish</a>.</p><h2 id="facebook-and-other-social-networks">Facebook and other social networks</h2><p>These services provide social buttons and similar features which we use on our website – such as the “Like” button.</p><p>To do so we embed code that they provide and we do not control ourselves. To function their buttons generally know if you’re logged in; for example Facebook use this to say “x of your friends like this”. We do not have any access to that information, nor can we control how those networks use it.</p><p>Social networks therefore could know that you’re viewing this website, if you use their services (that isn’t to say they do, but their policies may change). As our website is remarkably inoffensive we imagine this is not a concern for most users.</p><h2 id="changes-to-this-privacy-policy">Changes to this privacy policy</h2><p>Emulator.online has the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will post a notification on the main page of our Site.
