        <h2 id="about">About this policy</h2>
        <p>The Department of  Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) must comply with the<a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/series/c2004a03712"> Australian Privacy  Principles (APPs)</a> contained in the <i>Privacy  Act 1988 </i>(Cth) (Privacy Act).&nbsp; </p>
        <p>This Policy contains  information about DFAT’s collection, use, disclosure and storage of personal  information, including sensitive information, and how individuals may access  and correct personal information that we hold.</p>
        <p>We take your privacy seriously and make all efforts to  protect your personal information from misuse, interference and loss; and from unauthorised  access, modification or disclosure.&nbsp; If  you wish to make a complaint about the Department’s handling of your personal  information, please refer to the Complaints section of this Policy.</p>
        <h2 id="who">Who should read this  Policy</h2>
        <p>This Policy is  relevant to people whose personal information is collected, stored, used or  disclosed by DFAT including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Australian       Passport holders and applicants</li>
          <li>Australians living and travelling overseas, including       those who have registered via Smartraveller.gov.au</li>
          <li>Current       and former scholarship, Australia Award and grant applicants and       recipients</li>
          <li>Current       and former tenderers, contractors and sub-contractors to DFAT</li>
          <li>Invitees       to public diplomacy events held in Australia and overseas whose details       may be in contact databases</li>

          <li>Foreign diplomatic and consular staff (for       protocol-related purposes) </li>
          <li>Current       and former DFAT employees</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="anon">Remaining anonymous or  using a pseudonym</h2>
        <p>You  have the option of not identifying yourself, or using a pseudonym, when dealing  with the Department, for example, to make an enquiry or complaint.&nbsp; However, in circumstances where we are  required or authorised to deal with an identified individual by or under law,  or where it is impracticable for us to deal with you anonymously or  pseudonymously (such as when you apply for a passport, scholarship or  employment) this option will not be available to you.</p>
        <h2 id="kinds">What kinds of personal  information do we hold</h2>
        <p>Personal information held by the Department includes, but is not limited  to, personal contact details such as names and addresses, information about  citizenship, dates and places of birth, photographs of people, financial  information provided by contractors and consultants, employment history details  of staff and contractors and details provided by individuals registering on  <a href="http://www.smartraveller.gov.au">www.smartraveller.gov.au</a>.</p>
        <p>Sensitive information held by the Department includes, but is not limited  to: photographs used for biometric matching purposes to confirm identity on passport  applications (biometric information); health information provided by  individuals, for example when seeking consular assistance or applying for a  scholarship; political opinions or membership of political associations, for  example when provided by individuals in correspondence; and religious or  philosophical beliefs, for example when provided by staff as part of a security  assessment process.</p>
        <p>In this policy,  personal information and sensitive information has the meaning given to these  terms in the <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/series/c2004a03712">Privacy Act</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="why">Why we might collect  your personal information</h2>
        <p>The Department’s  role is to advance the interests of Australia and Australians  internationally.&nbsp; Personal information is  collected where it is necessary for, or directly related to, the  performance of our functions and activities.&nbsp;  These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>providing foreign, trade and development policy  advice to government</li>
          <li>working with other government agencies to ensure  that Australia's pursuit of its global, regional and bilateral interests is  coordinated effectively</li>
          <li>managing Australia’s international presence</li>
          <li>developing and implementing foreign, trade and  development policy</li>
          <li>facilitating safe and secure travel for Australians  overseas through timely and responsive travel advice, consular services and a  secure passport system</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some examples of why  we might collect your personal information include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>to       process your passport application</li>
          <li>to       process your registration on the Smartraveller website</li>
          <li>to       assist you if you seek or require consular help overseas</li>
          <li>to       process your application for a scholarship or grant</li>
          <li>to       enter into an agreement/contract with you</li>
          <li>when       you make a complaint </li>
          <li>when       you make an enquiry or request for information</li>
          <li>in       order to invite you to an event</li>
          <li>to       manage the recruitment, personnel and corporate functions of the       Department</li>
          <li>to       hold in a stakeholder or other contact database for consultation purposes</li>
          <li>to       administer the delivery of goods or services</li>
          <li>to process your security clearance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Information collected  for a primary purpose may sometimes be used or disclosed for a related  secondary purpose.&nbsp; For example,  information collected from contractors during a tender process may be used as  part of an evaluation or review of a particular aid project delivered by that  contractor.&nbsp; Personal information  collected from scholarship recipients may be used to invite those recipients to  alumni events.&nbsp; Employee information  collected to administer an individual’s employment may be used or disclosed  during a workplace investigation initiated by that individual.</p>
        <h2 id="how">How we collect  personal information</h2>
        <p>The Department collects personal information only by lawful  and fair means.&nbsp; It is our usual practice  to collect personal information directly from you or your authorised  representative when you deal with us by telephone, letter, email, face-to-face  or online.&nbsp; In particular, when you use  one of the websites maintained by the Department, including <a href="/">www.dfat.gov.au</a>, <a href="http://www.passports.gov.au">www.passports.gov.au</a>, <a href="http://www.smartraveller.gov.au">www.smartraveller.gov.au</a>, <a href="http://www.foreignminister.gov.au">www.foreignminister.gov.au</a>, <a href="http://www.trademinister.gov.au">www.trademinister.gov.au</a>,  <a href="http://www.asis.gov.au">www.asis.gov.au</a> and <a href="http://www.embassy.gov.au">www.embassy.gov.au</a>&nbsp; and their sub-domains, we may collect the  personal information provided to us via online forms on these websites  including when you subscribe to a list, register your travel details or  purchase a publication. &nbsp;We do not  collect your personal information when you only browse our website.</p>
        <p>We may collect  personal information from another source including a third party where you  consent, where it is unreasonable or impractical to collect the information  only from you or where we are required or authorised to do so by law.&nbsp; For example, we collect the name and contact  detail of guarantors provided by passport applicants on their passport  application forms as it is unreasonable or impractical to collect this  information directly from a guarantor.&nbsp;  We may collect personal information from third parties or publicly  available sources in the course of assessing competitive tender and grant  applications.</p>
        <p>The Department may  collect ‘sensitive information’ about you where you have consented, where the  collection is required or authorised by law or where the Department is  otherwise permitted under the Privacy Act including where we reasonably believe  that the collection is necessary for our diplomatic or consular functions or  activities.</p>
        <h2 id="store">How we store and  protect personal information</h2>
        <p>We take steps to protect the  personal information we hold against misuse, interference and loss; and from unauthorised  access, modification or disclosure.&nbsp;  These steps include password protection for electronic files, securing  paper files in locked cabinets and physical access restrictions. </p>
        <p>Personal information held by the  Department in Commonwealth records is managed securely through our  recordkeeping system.&nbsp; Staff members  across the Department have access to personal information on a need to know  basis only.&nbsp; When no longer required to  be retained as part of a Commonwealth record, personal information is destroyed  in accordance with the <i>Archives Act 1983</i>.</p>
        <h2 id="disclose">How we use and  disclose personal information</h2>
        <p>          Your personal  information will only be used and disclosed for the purpose for which it was collected,  or otherwise in accordance with the Privacy Act.&nbsp; For example, we use and disclose personal  information collected to respond to the assistance sought, application or  enquiry made or to make referrals.<br>
          Sometimes,  we will pass your personal information to other government agencies or  organisations, including overseas governments or organisations, for the purpose  of assisting with your enquiry or application.<br>
        We only use and disclose personal information (for example, to another Australian  government agency) for the purpose for which it was collected (the primary  purpose) unless one or more of the following applies: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>you have consented to use or disclosure for a secondary purpose</li>
          <li>you would reasonably expect the information to       be used or disclosed for a secondary purpose which is related to the       primary purpose, or in the case of sensitive information where the       secondary purpose is directly related to the primary purpose </li>
          <li>it is required or authorised by or under law </li>
          <li>we reasonably believe that use or disclosure       is necessary for our diplomatic or consular functions or activities</li>
          <li>it is reasonably necessary for enforcement       activities conducted by or on behalf of an enforcement body</li>
        </ul>
<p>The following are some examples of how we may use and  disclose personal information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>in a crisis overseas, we may use  personal information provided by family members to locate, identify and assist  Australians in distress.&nbsp; We may disclose  personal information to other agencies and bodies directly involved in the  crisis response.</li>
          <li>if you make an enquiry for information  or write to the Department or one of our portfolio Ministers making  representations on a particular issue, we may disclose your personal information  to another government department or Minister so that your enquiry or  correspondence is addressed by the appropriate entity within parliament or  government.</li>
          <li>if you apply for a scholarship, the personal  information provided in your application will be used to assess your  application and may be disclosed to Australian educational institutions.</li>
          <li>if you apply for an Australian passport  we may disclose your personal information in accordance with the law to the  immigration department, civil registries and licensing authorities to verify  information and assist to establish your identity and eligibility for a  passport.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="overseas">Disclosure of personal information to overseas recipients</h2>
        <p>          The Department’s core functions include the provision of consular  assistance to Australian citizens and the administration of the Australian aid  program.&nbsp; In order to fulfil these  functions, it is likely that some personal information will be disclosed to overseas  recipients.&nbsp; For example, we may disclose  your name and travel details to a foreign emergency service so that they may  locate or assist you in the event of a crisis or emergency in that country.&nbsp; We operate a network of offices via our  overseas posts in order to deliver our services globally.</p>
        <p>We do not disclose your personal information to any overseas recipient  unless one of the following applies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the recipient is subject to a law or       binding scheme substantially similar to the APPs, and the individual can       access mechanisms for protecting their privacy</li>
          <li>you have consented to the disclosure after       being expressly informed that we will not be taking reasonable steps to       ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the APPs</li>
          <li>it is required or authorised by law</li>
          <li>we reasonably believe it is necessary for our       diplomatic or consular functions and activities, or it is otherwise in       accordance with the Privacy Act</li>
          <li>it is required or authorised by an       international agreement relating to information sharing to which Australia       is a party</li>
          <li>it is reasonably necessary for an       enforcement related activity conducted by, or on behalf of, an enforcement       body and the recipient performs similar functions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="access">How to access or correct  your personal information held by DFAT</h2>
        <p>How you access or correct  your personal information depends on which part of the Department you have had  dealings with.&nbsp; For example, in order to  access or amend your passport information, information will be held by the  Australian Passport Office and access or requests for correction should be made  to <a href="http://www.passports.gov.au">www.passports.gov.au</a>.&nbsp; Consular case  file information is held by the Consular Operations Branch and access or  requests for correction should be directed to <a href="mailto:centre.conops@dfat.gov.au">centre.conops@dfat.gov.au</a>.&nbsp; If you are unsure where your information  might be held please contact us (see details at the end of this Policy).</p>
        <p> If  you wish to access personal information we hold about you, or to correct that  personal information, we will allow access or make the changes unless we are  required or authorised under the Privacy Act, the <i>Freedom of Information Act  1982 </i>or other relevant law to refuse access or correction.</p>
        <h2 id="complaints"> Complaints</h2>
        <p>We take your privacy seriously and make all efforts to  protect your personal information from misuse, interference, and loss; and from  unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.&nbsp; If you are concerned about the Department’s  handling of your personal information, you may wish to raise your concern  directly with the area of the Department involved.&nbsp; This may allow for an informal and direct  resolution of your complaint.</p>
        <p>If you are not satisfied with this outcome, or prefer to make  your complaint directly to the Department’s central privacy area, you may send  your complaint in writing to either:</p>
        <p>Director,<br>
          Freedom of Information and Privacy Law Section<br>
          RG Casey Building<br>

        <p><a href="mailto:privacy@dfat.gov.au">privacy@dfat.gov.au</a></p>
        <p>If you make a formal complaint we will gather as much  relevant background information as possible in the circumstances.&nbsp; In order to assist the Department in its consideration  of your complaint please provide as much information as possible in describing  how you think your privacy has been interfered with, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What happened</li>
          <li>When it happened (including dates)</li>
          <li>What personal information of yours was affected</li>
          <li>Who did it (include individual names if known)</li>
          <li>How and when you found out about it</li>
          <li>Your contact details</li>
          <li>Any other relevant information, including what, if any, outcome you       might be expecting from the complaint process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the alleged privacy breach involves personal information  which does not belong to you we will ask you for evidence that you have  authority to act on behalf of the person whose information is in issue before  proceeding any further.&nbsp; Your complaint  will be considered by a departmental officer who has not been involved in the  conduct about which you are complaining.</p>
        <p>We will provide a written response to your formal  complaint.&nbsp; If a breach of the APPs has  been identified as a result of your complaint, we will advise you of the  findings and proposed follow up action which may include, for example, an  apology, targeted staff training, revised security or storage arrangements, or  amendment of forms to prevent similar situations arising.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>If you are not satisfied with our response, you may wish to submit a  complaint to the Office of the Information Commissioner in Sydney:</p>
        <p>T: 1300 363 992<br>

        <p>You may also complain directly  to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) rather than to the Department.
