Below are descriptions for each type of user so you can determine what category of user applies to you. </p>
<ol type="1">
<li><b><i>Former Embark Users</i></b> are users who used one of the free Embark web pages when it was owned by The Princeton Review (which was during the period of October, 2001 to February 17, 2007). </li>
<li><b><i>Former Embark School Application Users</i></b> are users who made use of an Embark hosted online college application web page when Embark was owned by The Princeton Review (which was during the period of October, 2001 to February 17, 2007). </li>
<li><b><i>All Other Former Embark Users</i></b> are all users of the Embark website prior to October, 2001. </li>

<li><b><i>Current Users </i></b>are all other users of the Embark website after February 17, 2007. <b><i>Current School Application Users </i></b>that elect to have Embark store their data in the Embark.com profile are also <b><i>Current Users</i></b> (and the <b><i>Current Users</i></b> policies will apply). </li></ol></td></tr>

<p><b>Policies for Each Category of User<br></b><b><i>Former Embark Users</i></b><br>All of the information you provided to us while we were a part of The Princeton Review is governed by The Princeton Review privacy policy that was in effect at the time you provided information about yourself to Embark. As of June 20, 2005, The Princeton Review privacy policy provided that: "We don't share the information you have given us without your permission to do so." What does this mean - Embark will not share any of the information you provided to us while we were a part of The Princeton Review unless you want us to. This applies to all the information you provided to Embark while it was a part of The Princeton Review.<br><br><i>Important Notice:</i> If you use our Website after February 17, 2007 and give us information about yourself (whether it's new information or the same information you previously gave us), this new giving of information will be governed by the policies applicable to a <b><i>Current User.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Former Embark School Application Users</i></b><br>The information you provided to us on a college application hosted by Embark while we were a part of The Princeton Review was not covered by The Princeton Review privacy policy. Further, Embark did not have its own privacy policy. Since there is no privacy policy that applies to this information, it will be governed by the policies applicable to a <b><i>Current User.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>All Other Former Embark Users</i></b><br>The information you provided to us was not covered by a privacy policy because Embark did not have a privacy policy. Since there is no privacy policy that applies to this information, it will be governed by the policies applicable to a <b><i>Current User.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Current School Application Users</i></b><br>The information you provide to us through the Apply Online Program will be governed by the Embark Application Privacy Policy, which is described in the Embark hosted online college application.
