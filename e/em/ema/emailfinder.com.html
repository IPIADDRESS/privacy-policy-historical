            <h1>Privacy Policy </h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to EmailFinder.com, a website designed to help you find information available in public records. This privacy policy is for visitors and registered users (“you”) of EmailFinder.com (the “website” or “service”), which is owned and operated by Inflection.com, Inc. (“Inflection”, “we” or “our”):
            </p>
            <p>This policy discusses what information the site collects, how we use it, and the limited circumstances in which we may share it. </p>


            <h2>What is covered by this privacy policy</h2>
            <p>
                This privacy policy covers EmailFinder.com, which is designed to help you find public records information about yourself and others. This site is not a consumer-reporting agency as defined by the <a href="https://www.peoplesmart.com/fcra" target="_blank">Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> (FCRA). Visit <a href="http://www.goodhire.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GoodHire.com</a> for all your employment screening needs.
            </p>

            <h2>What isn’t covered by this policy?</h2>
            <p>
                This privacy policy only applies to information collected by this website, which is owned and operated by Inflection.com, Inc. This policy does not apply to the practices of other website domains that this site links to, to other Inflection services, to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    If you want to submit an opt-out request to remove yourself from the search results of this and other people search sites we operate, please <a href="https://www.peoplesmart.com/optout-go" target="_blank">click here</a>. This link will take you to our opt-out service, which is powered by PeopleSmart. We will try our best to honor your request.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you choose to opt out of search results, that choice may affect the visibility of the relevant information on our entire network of sites, which includes this website, Peoplesmart.com, Identity.com, and other affiliated properties.  We try our best to honor your request, but our opt-out system is not perfect and it may miss records that don’t perfectly match the information you submit.
            </p>
            <h2>Your Public Records Exist Elsewhere In The World – We Do Not Control Them</h2>
            <p>
                This site displays public records that are available in the real world, such as criminal history records from law enforcement agencies and bankruptcy records from courts. Original copies of public records can only be changed by those entities. Inflection obtains its public records through third party sources. Please note that exercising the opt-out option will not actually delete or change the original copies of such records.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> If you consent to the release of your information via another Inflection product or service (e.g., a background report on Goodhire.com), your public records will be shared for the purpose you specify.
            </p>

            <h2>Your safety and privacy are very important to us</h2>

            <p>
                We want to minimize the risk of harm resulting from use of public records information. Please contact us if you are particularly at risk for certain types of harm as a result of your public records being available on this site. Inflection will work with you on mitigating the risk of any potential harm, including physical harm, threats to public officials such as law enforcement, and issues related to identity theft. Please send your request to our Privacy Department at <a href="mailto:privacy@emailfinder.com">privacy@emailfinder.com</a> along with appropriate documentation.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your information when you give us permission.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>With Our Parent Company:</strong> Inflection.com, Inc. owns a variety of products and services in addition to this site, including Identity.com, Goodhire.com, PeopleSmart.com, and other people search sites. Data collected under this privacy policy is shared with Inflection and stored alongside data from those other services. Your choices on one service may affect another service – for instance, opting out on PeopleSmart.com may mean that your records will not be available on Identity.com.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We use certain trusted third parties to provide services for us such as payments processing. We only share the minimum amount of information necessary to provide the service. In addition, any third-party service provider we use is required to give your information the same protections that are outlined here in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Deidentified and Aggregated Data:</strong> We may share or disclose information we collect after deidentifying and aggregating it so it cannot be linked back to an individual person. We contractually require third parties to respect this practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event that Inflection is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. However, the new entity will be bound by this privacy policy after the sale or transfer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Fraud and Abuse Prevention:</strong> We partner with certain third party vendors to prevent fraud and abuse. When you make a purchase, we analyze your payment information and unique device identifiers (including, but not limited to, IP address, geographical location, browser and operating system settings) to identify suspected fraudulent activity and block it.  We may share information associated with activity flagged as fraudulent (including, but not limited to, payment information, email addresses, and unique device identifiers) with our security partners or law enforcement for further investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Legal Process and Emergency Circumstances:</strong> We may disclose or preserve for future disclosure your information if we believe, after due consideration, that doing so is reasonably necessary to protect Inflection's rights or property or to comply with a law, regulation, valid legal process, or to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are a law enforcement officer seeking information from Inflection about one of our users, please reference our <a href="http://www.inflection.com/privacy/additional-privacy-resources/law-enforcement-guide" target="_blank">Law Enforcement Guidelines</a> for further information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unless prohibited from doing so by law or court order, we will do our best to provide subjects of law enforcement requests with advance notice before we disclose their information to law enforcement, if we have contact information for that person. We reserve the right to withhold advance notice where it would impede an investigation of identity theft, or in situations involving imminent physical harm or harm to minors.
            </p>
