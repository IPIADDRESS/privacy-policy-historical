		<h2><strong><a name="1">What does this privacy policy cover?</a></strong></h2>
		<p>This policy covers how EmailFinder.com treats personal information that we collect and receive from you, including information related to your use of our website, products, and services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage. Unless noted otherwise, this privacy policy does not apply to any information in our people search databases, which is covered separately under our <a href="/opt_out_terms.shtml" target="_blank">Opt-Out Policy</a>.</p>

		<h2><strong><a name="2">What information do we collect?</a></strong></h2>
		<p>We collect some information that is personal (i.e. information that identifies you, either alone or in combination with other data.) We also collect information that is non-personal and does not, on its own, identify you. When non-personal information is combined with other information so that it does identify you, we treat that combination as personal information.</p>

		<p>In order to provide certain services, we may collect additional information from you.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When you search for a person using our website, we collect and store a log of your searches, which can include the name, email address, phone number, or address that you searched for.</li>
			<li>If you wish to enhance your search results using information from third-party services such as Facebook or LinkedIn, we may ask you to give us authorization to access information about you stored in those third-party services.</li>
