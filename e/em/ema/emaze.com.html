<div class="TableText">
<p>Emaze is a service offered by Averum, Inc. Emaze respects the privacy of any person who uses our software or hosted service. We have published this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. If you have any questions about Emaze's Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@emaze.com">privacy@emaze.com</a> or (425) 486-2149.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is intended to communicate how we collect and use information about you, how we protect that information, and how you may participate in protecting your information.</p>
<p><b>Collected Information</b></p>
<p>Emaze requires advertiseres and publishers (customers) who use our service to provide contact information, including name, company, address, email, and phone number. For advertisers, billing information is also required, including a credit card number. This information is used for the purposes of providing our service to you, to contact you if you have expressed interest in our service, for communicating announcements or promotions to you, or to communicate with you regarding concerns, feedback or suggestions you may have.</p>
<p>Emaze does not distribute, sell, rent or share customer information, except as may be required by law. Customer information is shared with third parties only as a component of providing our service to you, and then only the information necessary to provide that service is shared.</p>
<p>Emaze customers use our online applications to host data and information. Emaze will not review, share, distribute, print, reference, or access any such data except that which is necessary to provide our service to you, such as billing information, or as may be required by law. We will view or access individual records only with your permission, such as to resolve a problem or support issue, for the purpose of training your employees, or to customize the service for you at your request. Of course, users of the Emaze services are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and passwords.</p>
<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's hard drive containing information about the user. Emaze uses only temporary cookies which are deleted once a user closes their browser. If a user has turned cookies off, the user will not be able to use our services, although our public website will be accessible.
<p><b>Log Files</b></p>
<p>Emaze utilizes log files to analyze usage trends of both our public website and our online service. Individual users are not tracked, even when logged into our service. Information collected in these log files is not used to personally identify any users. It shows us generically and in the aggregate how our site and software are being used. The following information is gathered in the log files: IP address, referring URL, time zone, browser type, operating system, files accessed, and errors generated. All this information is gathered and used only by Emaze to help us analyze usage and trends to improve our website and service.</p>
<p><b>Links</b></p>
This website contains links to other sites. Emaze is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. Users are encouraged to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy policies of those sites. Emaze's site uses only the emaze.com domain, so any domain other than that means you are no longer on the Emaze site.
<p><b>Correcting/Updating Personal Information</b></p>
<p>If your information is incorrect, you may either login to our service to update your information or contact us to request that we update your information for you.</p>
<p><b>Opt-Out Policy</b></p>
<p>Emaze may periodically send you notifications, special offers, feedback requests, or other messages via email or regular mail. If you would prefer not to receive these requests, simply send your request to support@emaze.com . Where possible, each communication sent via email will have instructions for how to opt out of future messages.</p>
<p><b>Cobrand Partners</b></p>
<p>For those customers who registered for our service via an affiliate or cobranded partner, Emaze tracks and records which partner referred you to our service. This information is used to display the proper cobranded header/logo to you as well as for reporting and revenue-sharing purposes with that partner. Unless otherwise noted, Emaze shares with that partner only summary and aggregate information. No personally-identifiable information is shared other than the information which the partner originally provided about you to Emaze.</p>
