	      <p>
	      This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.
	      </p>
	      <p>
	      This security is enhanced by our use of firewalls protecting all of the Company servers. We also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job 
	      (for example, our customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information.
	      Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every month, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected.
	      Finally, the physical servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure collocation facility, within locked cages that only The Company network administrators have access to. This facility provides security 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and guaranties our servers against power outages by using automated backup power systems.
