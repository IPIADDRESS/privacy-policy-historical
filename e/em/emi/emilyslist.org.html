<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>At EMILY's List we are committed to protecting your privacy online. While using our website located at www.emilyslist.org ("EMILY's List" or "Site"), you do not have to identify yourself or divulge personal information. If you should choose to give us your personal information, you decide the amount of information you wish to provide.</p>

<p>Our privacy policy explains the information practices we use at EMILY's List's site related to:</p>

<ul><li>How we protect your information</li>

<li>What constitutes personal information</li>

<li>What personal information we collect, and how we use it</li>

<li>The limited circumstances under which we may share your information</li>

<li>How to contact us about privacy</li>
</ul>

<p>Our Site links to a limited number of other websites. EMILY's List is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of these websites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements for each website you visit. EMILY's List will occasionally update this privacy policy as changes to the site necessitate it, or as we otherwise deem appropriate. When EMILY's List posts changes to this policy, you will see the word "updated" next to the privacy policy link on the front page of this Site. Your use of the Site following the posting of such changes or revised policy will constitute your consent to any changes in our privacy practices. We encourage you to periodically review this policy to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>

<h2>How do we protect your information?</h2>

<p>We have endeavored to put in place reasonable security measures to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of personal information while it is under our control. For example, our computer systems have restricted access limited only to those persons and organizations necessary to its proper functioning. This access applies to both electronic and physical security measures. Highly sensitive data including credit card information is additionally secured through the use of encryption that makes unauthorized access more difficult, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software. Our servers are located in a locked, secure environment. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.</p>

<h2>What is personal information?</h2>

<p>As used in this policy, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other account number), and information about that individual's activities, such as information about his or her use of the Site, when directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed.</p>

<h2>What personal information do we collect, and how do we use it?</h2>

<h3>Generally</h3>

<p>On registration, sign-up and contribution forms on the Site, we may ask for your name, address, telephone number, credit card information, bank account information, email address and/or IM address as well as the name of the person who referred you to the site. We may obtain information about you from outside sources and add it to or combine it with the information we collect through this Site. We will use your email address and the other personal information we collect to provide you news and information about EMILY's List; to process your request or transactions (such as contributions); to inform you about other news, information or events we think will be of interest to you; to facilitate your use of the Site, as well as our administration and operation of the Site; to respond to your emails, submissions, comments or requests; and for the purpose for which the information was provided.</p>

<h3>"Send to a Friend"</h3>

<p>EMILY's List makes it easy for you to spread the word about EMILY's List with its "Send to a Friend" feature. When you use "Send to a Friend", we may store email addresses or any information about the people you contact.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>A cookie is a tiny text file that is stored on your computer by EMILY's List. We use cookies to tailor your experience on our site according to the preferences you have specified. When you visit the EMILY's List website we only access the cookie file that we have stored on your computer. We cannot and do not access any information stored in a cookie by other websites. Our cookies do not contain any personal information; however, if we combine our cookies with or link them to any of the personally identifying information, we would treat this information as personal information. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn about these functions. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, you may not be able to access certain Site features.</p>

<h3>IP Addresses and Log File Data</h3>

<p>We log IP address, which is the location of your computer or network on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We also use page hits in the aggregate to track the popularity of pages that people visit in order to improve the quality of the site. There is no personal information collected in our log files; however, we treat log file data as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above.</p>

<h2>Information on Children</h2>

<p>Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulations establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13, and we have designed our sites to block our knowing acceptance of information from children under 13 whenever age-related information is requested.</p>

<p>Parents with questions may email us at information@emilyslist.org or call us at (202) 326-1400.</p>

<h2>Under what circumstances do we share the personal information you provide?</h2>

<p>We do not sell, rent or provide your personal information to third parties without your prior consent except in the limited circumstances described in this policy (and in any updates to this policy that may be posted to the Site from time to time). We may share personal information with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers (“Service Providers”) who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the Site or EMILY's List and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us, such as payment processors (for contributions) or hosting services. However, we are not responsible for the actions of such Service Providers, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these Service Providers or to other third parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them. From time to time, we may also share your personal information with organizations having similar political viewpoints and objectives, in furtherance of our own political objectives.</p>

<p>In addition, we may disclose your personal information in the following, other ways:</p>

<h3>When you contribute money online</h3>

<p>We are required by federal and state law to collect and report the name, mailing address, occupation and employer of individuals whose contributions exceed certain amounts. These records are available to the public. We also make a note of your telephone number and email address, which helps us to contact you quickly if follow-up on your contribution is necessary under Federal or state election law.</p>

<h3>When you sign one of our petitions</h3>

<p>We treat your name, city, state, and any comments as public information. We may, for example, provide compilations of petitions, with your comments, to national leaders, without disclosing email addresses. We may also make comments along with your city and state available to the press and public online.</p>

<h3>To comply with law or to protect our rights or the rights of others</h3>

<p>In addition, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of EMILY's List, our users, or the public, including without limitation to protect EMILY's List or our users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of our Site.</p>

<h3>In connection with a transfer of assets</h3>

<p>Information about our users, including personal information, we collect may also be disclosed or transferred in connection with any transfer of assets from EMILY's List to another political organization or other entity.</p>

<h2>How can you contact us?</h2>

<p>If you have any questions about our privacy policy, the information we have collected from you online, the practices of this Site or your interaction with this website, or if you wish to verify, correct or delete any personal information we have collected from you, send email to: <a href="mailto:information@emilyslist.org">information@emilyslist.org</a>.
