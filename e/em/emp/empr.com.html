this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personally Identifiable Information and
your Financial Information private and will not share it with third parties,
unless such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with a court order or other
legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; (c) enforce our terms of
service; or (d) to allow our suppliers to perform their contractual responsibilities
on our behalf. </li><li>Unless you opt-out, we may

participate in industry-sponsored programs which present you with branded
sponsor-selected materials to provide clinical information to physicians about
medical conditions, options for treatment and recommended products. Your
invitation will use the Personally Identifiable Information that you have provided
or that we have obtained from third parties, and non-personally identifiable
information which we gather from your site visits by the use of cookies or
other tracking technologies. Sponsor programs will be affiliated with your area
of specialty and any specific interests you have shared with us. Not everyone

to guarantee to our satisfaction that they have sufficient processes in place
to ensure the security of your data whilst it is in their care. You expressly
consent to the sharing of your Personally Identifiable Information with our contractors
and third party service suppliers for the purpose of providing services to you.
Haymarket will share user data with the accredited provider(s) of CME/CE activities
in which users participate, and/or medical education and communications
companies who assisted in the development of CME/CE activities in which users
participate.</li><li>In order to comply with the
Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we also may provide lists of customers who have
opted-out of email promotion for Haymarket products to other companies, so they
can be suppressed from mailings those companies sent on Haymarket’s behalf. In
addition, if you unsubscribe from a mailing we sent to our own list on behalf
of a third party, your removal instruction may also be supplied to the third
party and added to their own suppression file. If you continue receiving email
after opting out, please contact us at custserve@haymarketmedia.com.</li></ul>
