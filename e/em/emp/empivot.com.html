<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p>In addition to providing a video sharing service and search engine related to green-related media, emPivot.com provides a service that allows our members to set up unique personal profiles and channels that can be linked together through networks of friends. emPivot members are able to view each others’ profiles, communicate with businesses and make new connections, share videos, post comments and describe their interests. As part of this service, it is required that we request and display some personal information to other members and visitors. This allows us to promote this community capability and enable our members to grow their connections. emPivot members are able to modify and change their profile information at any time and can control how other members and the emPivot generates communications to their account.</p>
<p>emPivot.com takes privacy very seriously. We know you might have questions, so when you have one regarding this privacy policy, please email us at privacy[at]emPivot.com.</p>
<p><strong>How We Collect and Use Information for emPivot.com</strong><br>
Certain functions of emPivot.com require that we collect user submitted information such as user name, password, name, and email address to authenticate users and to send notifications to users about the emPivot.com service. emPivot.com also collects other profile data through its voluntary user submitted areas, including but not limited to: personal interests, gender, age, education and occupation for the purpose of broadening the ability of our community to connect.</p>
<p>emPivot.com also records and logs non-personally-identifiable information including profile information, aggregate user data, IP address, and browser type from members and visitors on the site. We use this information to best serve your interest and security. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the emPivot.com website services. This is very generic information and is not identifiable at the individual level, and therefore we may share this information with third-parties to develop relevant services and advertisements for members. We do monitor User IP addresses for security and monitoring purposes.</p>
<p><strong>How We Display Your Information Publicly</strong><br>
When you become a member of emPivot.com, parts of your profile information will become public. This information if filled in fully includes: a member’s profile picture, name, and geographic location. We display this information to provide for an informed user interaction in the emPivot community.</p>
<p><strong><br>
Email Addresses: Contacting and Inviting Your Friends to emPivot</strong><br>
emPivot makes it easy for members to invite friends not signed up at emPivot.com to join our video sharing and community service by sending an invitation emails via our invitation system. We do not store or use the information of the person who received the invitation.</p>
<p>emPivot members will store other emPivot members’ user names, not their email addresses within their member contact list. Through this function, members can send other members and invitations and other communications, which will be delivered via emPivot to that members inbox at emPivot. If a member has their preferences set to notify the member of new communication, that correspondence will be forwarded to the receiving member’s email by way of emPivot and the other member will not have access to that email address.</p>
<p>A user’s email address is not shared or displayed to people within a user’s personal network. User names are revealed as the primary identifier for an identity on the site. However, the Name field from the profile is shown on the profile page. If you do not wish to share your full name, please modify your name field for your comfort level. To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the service, emPivot allows users to search for other members using first and last name, email address, and schools and/or companies where users may have attended or worked.</p>
<p>If you have opted into newsletter services we will send you updates and newsletters to your email address. All users are subject to receiving basic service updates from the emPivot.com service. Within the My Account &gt; Notifications area members may toggle on and off their receive email settings for various communications of emPivot.com.</p>
