With Whom we Share your Personal Information</h2><p>We never sell or rent your email address to unaffiliated companies. We may use your email address to send you messages that describe new items, sales, specials and other offers that we think will be of interest to you. If you would like to opt-out of receiving these emails from Us or our affiliates, please click on <a href="/Account/AccountHomePage">Your Account</a> and follow the instructions outlined in the Notification Options section.</p><p>We also do not sell other personal customer information to unaffiliated third-parties. We will share personal customer information that we collect only with our affiliates, agents, representatives and trusted service providers for the limited purposes of fulfilling customer orders; offering certain products and services in connection with The Website; offering products or services which we believe you may be interested; communicating to customers; providing customer service; enhancing and improving the customer shopping experience; and providing a personalized shopping experience and completing credit card transactions. We may use or share with our strategic partners and affiliates, aggregated demographic and statistical information. This information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We may assign or transfer any or all of your personal information to the relevant third-party in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale of our assets.
</p><p>Aside from the purposes described above, we may also disclose your personal information in special circumstances if required to do so by law, court order or other governmental authority or when we believe in good faith that disclosing this information is otherwise necessary or advisable, including, for instance, to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with the rights or property of EmpireCtores.Co, another user or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p><h2><a name="4"></a>4. Controlling the Use of Your Personal Information</h2><p>Creating an account lets us provide a better shopping experience for you and allows you to make purchases more conveniently without having to re-enter your payment and shipping information each time you make a purchase on our site.

Simply go to <a href="/Account/AccountHomePage">Your Account</a> then click "Contact Information" and edit whatever information you wish.

Controlling Marketing Communication you Receive</h2><p>We may periodically send you email messages describing new items, sales, specials and other offers that we think will be of interest to you. If you would like to opt-out of receiving these emails from Us, please click on <a href="/Account/AccountHomePage">Your Account</a> click on "Notification Options" and remove the check in the box next to the "Sales &amp; Specials" notification option.  You can also opt-out of receiving these messages by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link in the email message itself.</p><p>The only email messages you will receive from us when you elect not to receive informational emails will be to confirm any purchases you make on our site, let you know your order has been shipped, respond to your Help Desk inquiries and to answer any other questions you may have about our site. We may also need to send operational emails to inform you of any changes to our site that might affect your personal information, or to announce product recalls.</p><h2><a name="6"></a>6. How we Protect your Personal Information</h2><p>The security of your personal information is very important to us. In our efforts to protect your online transactions, we use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your personal information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet.</p><p>We have also obtained a digital certificate from DigiCert®, a leading provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secure portion of our site (which is any page containing any of your personal information), an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small pop-up window displaying site-security information will appear. This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form to an EmpireStores.Co web server, not to some unknown or unauthorized server.</p><p>Ultimately, your personal information is protected by the password that you entered when you created an account (or another password you chose after changing a previous password). Please keep this password confidential. The confidentiality of your password is your responsibility to protect. You may change it anytime by going to <a href="/Account/AccountHomePage">Your Account</a>, then click "Change Password" and enter a new password.</p><h2><a name="7"></a>7. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2><p>We reserve the right to change, modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time, without prior notice, and we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Privacy Policy and your continued use of The Website constitutes your agreement as to all such updated or modified Privacy Policies. By using or visiting The Website, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this policy, then do not use or visit The Website.</p><h2><a name="8"></a>8. How to Contact Us</h2><p>If you have comments or questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact <a href="/Account/Inquiry">Customer Service</a>. We will address any issue to the best of our abilities.</p><p>Thank you for your support of our policies.</p>
