	<li>Otherwise in accordance with applicable laws and regulations</li>
</ul>

<p>Our commitment to your privacy:
</p><p>1. What data We collect from you.  
</p><p>Depending on how you use Our websites, Personal Information may include:
</p><p>	A.	Information provided by you when you register for a Personal Account, enter competitions or promotions, or take part in market research
</p><p>B.	Information about your online activities such as, your browsing patterns, click paths, searches you perform when using Our websites, and when you order products from Our online merchants/advertisers. Web usage data is received from your browser and recorded on Our server logs, including but not limited to, your Internet Protocol address, information about your geographic location, and "cookie" technology (visit Our Cookie Policy for more information on Our use of cookies and how to decline them). We may combine this web usage data with other information collected about you, for example, whether you arrived at Our site through a marketing email or promotional campaign, data about your user registration, or previous web usage data stored against a previous cookie set on your machine.
</p><p>C.	We may receive confirmation when you open an email sent by Us, such as news or promotions. It is clearly stated on each email how you can opt out of receiving further emails from Us (see section 3 to read more about your choices and marketing preferences)
</p><p>D.	Records of your communications with Us (whether in writing, by email or by telephone) 
</p><p>E.	Information from other sources for example purchases from retailers that you were referred to by Us.
</p><p>F.	Technical and diagnostic information gathered or received when you use Our websites. Some of the technical information that may be collected or received includes: the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), CPU type (e.g. Pentium), the manner in which you connect to the Internet (e.g., your Internet Service provider and your connection speed through dial-up or broadband access) or data relating to computer malfunctions or problems occurring when you use your computer to access Our websites. Additionally, We may collect information about other software on your computer for protecting your security or improving your online experience.
</p><p>2.	In order to enhance your online experience with Our websites, We use your Personal Information to analyse and constantly improve the operations and services We offer.
</p><p>		How We use the data We have collected:
</p><p>A.	Information provided by you, as outlined in 1A. This helps Us build up a picture of your preferences and interests so that when you visit Our websites We can accurately respond to your requests by customising the offers and relevant information you see. We will also use this information to undertake sales and marketing research and to tailor Our marketing campaigns and email communications specifically to you, and your recent activity on Our site. We retain your registration information so that you can return to saved lists or content generated by yourself which provides you with a more personalised experience. We may contact you to ask for feedback on your experiences whilst using Our websites.
</p><p>B.	Information provided when you interact with Our websites as in 1B. We try to ensure that Our website offers visitors exactly what they are looking for. Web usage data is used for statistical purposes and helps Us to measure the success of Our advertising campaigns, sales and marketing research, tracking page usage and targeting content for Our audience. It is not used in a manner that would identify you personally. It enables Us to understand how useful you find different sections of Our websites to be, so We can make Our websites and associated advertising/marketing appealing and relevant to as many users as possible. In addition, We may provide this type of statistical information to Our partners so that they too understand how people interact with their areas on Our websites, and may also provide you with an optimal Web experience. See section 4 to read more about who your Personal Information can be disclosed to. 

</p><p>Collection of the cookie data also helps save you time, for example if you are halfway through making a product selection, Our cookies will allow you to browse other areas of the website and return back to your search page and previous product selections.
</p><p>C.	Email confirmation as in 1C. If your computer supports this type of programme We use this information to help Us make emails more interesting and helpful. See section 3 to read more about your choices and marketing preferences 
</p><p>D.	Communications with Us as in 1D are used to improve Our service to you and on occasion for the training and monitoring of Our staff. We may keep records in your account history of your complaints about other registered users online behavior, and any reported violation of Our Terms and Conditions of Usage that you or someone using your account may have committed.
</p><p>E.	Information from other sources as in 1E is used to enable Us to improve the personalisation of Our service and improve the product offering within Our websites.
</p><p>F.	Technical and diagnostic information as in 1F may be used to help diagnose problems with Our servers, to analyze trends, for system administration and to improve your online experience on Our websites. We don't link these addresses to any person's name or identity.

</p><p>3. Your choices and marketing preferences
</p><p>You can tell Us about your preferences regarding how your Personal Information is used for marketing purposes, and review and change your marketing preferences at any time by visiting your Personal Account or emailing <a href="mailto:help@empora.com">help@empora.com</a>. As stated previously, if you decide to not disclose some information, you may be unable to use certain features on Our websites for example, in order to receive an email alert for a product price watch you are required to submit your email address. 

</p><p>We offer you the opportunity to receive information about exclusive promotions, special offers and other news from Us. Unless you tell Us otherwise We may use your purchase history to communicate information We think may interest you. We'll only do this by email, SMS and other similar forms of communication where We're letting you know about Our services and promotions or promotions and news from Our partner merchants if you've told Us that you'd like this to happen. 

</p><p>You can sign up for direct marketing by registering on this website. You will also be asked if you want to receive direct marketing if you set up a Personal Account or if you enter a competition or register for a promotion with any of Our websites. Your details may be shared within Our group websites. We will normally send direct marketing by email if We have your email address. We may send you offers on behalf of other businesses such as Our partner merchants. However, when We do so, We do not give the other business your name and contact details. If you do not wish to receive these offers, please notify Us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:help@empora.com">help@empora.com</a>. See Section 4 to read more about who your data can be disclosed to.

</p><p>If you would like Us to stop sending direct marketing to you, We offer simple ways to do this. Whenever you receive direct marketing you will be told how to unsubscribe. In addition, if you have a Personal Account you can change your marketing preferences at any time by amending your membership profile online, or by telephoning or writing to Us (<a href="/corporate/contact/" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>). As the choices you make about your preferences and settings may not take effect immediately, it is possible you may receive a communication which you have requested not to receive during the period in which your request is being processed.

</p><p>If you consented to receive marketing communications when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion you can tell Us that you do not wish to receive any more by writing, with your full name, address and other contact details (<a href="/corporate/contact/" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>)

</p><p>If you tell Us that you do not wish to receive further direct marketing, We will continue to send you important information about your Personal Account and any relevant legal notices. Please note that if you do not wish to receive any legal notices from Us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of Our websites, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes. 

</p><p>From time to time We may run optional surveys. Surveys by or on behalf of Us are conducted in accordance with the Market Research Society and ICC/ESOMAR guidelines. These guidelines ensure that participation in any research is confidential and voluntary and that results do not identify individual respondents. For the purpose of surveys We may combine cookie or other data with your answers but We will ensure that this does not affect the anonymity of the results.

</p><p>4. Who can your data be disclosed to?
</p><p>We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We may pass on your Personal Information (including contact details) to other companies whose products and services may be of interest to you but We will only do this where you've clearly indicated that you'd like this to happen. We share your personal information only as provided herein or with your consent, to the entities that are controlled by Us or to the entities described below:

</p><p>A.	Disclosure of your data to other businesses may be necessary to ensure the smooth provision to you of the products, services and information you request, such as Our merchant partners you may have been referred to from Our site. We work closely with a variety of such businesses that operate within Our websites or sell items to you within Our services. You can easily recognize when a third party business is associated with your transaction, as a new window will open to their site. For all online purchases that you may make from third parties when referred from Our websites, ensure that you review their privacy policies and contact them directly if you have any questions. They may have privacy policies that differ from Us, and they may therefore use Personal Information which you provide to them differently. 
</p><p>B.	We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on Our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing assistance. We may also provide your personal information to agents who will use it to verify aggregate usage data that We provide to Our partners. You hereby consent to Our sharing of your personal information for all the above purposes. 
</p><p>C.
