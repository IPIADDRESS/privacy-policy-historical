However, as part of your registration for the Services, you may receive certain communications from Indie Labs, such as administrative announcements and customer service messages regarding the Services and products, and you will not be able to opt out of receiving such communications.</p>
	<p>From time to time, we may implement solutions designed to more efficiently capture your communications preferences. In any such event, we will strive to reflect any previously stated communicated preferences within such solutions.</p>
	<p>We do not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may share and you hereby consent to our sharing of personal information with the following:</p>
