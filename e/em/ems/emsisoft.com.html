<h4 class="Applicability-of-this-Privacy-Policy">Applicability Of This Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to Emsisoft‚Äôs software products and online platform, including the associated Emsisoft desktop and mobile applications (collectively, the ‚Äú<strong>Services</strong>‚Äù), emsisoft.com and other Emsisoft websites (collectively, the ‚Äú<strong>Websites</strong>‚Äù) and other interactions (e.g., customer service inquiries, etc.) you may have with Emsisoft. If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the Services, Websites or any other aspect of Emsisoft‚Äôs business.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrate with the Services through the Emsisoft platform (‚Äú<strong>Third Party Services</strong>‚Äù), or any other third party products, services or businesses. In addition, a separate terms agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the ‚Äú<strong>Customer Agreement</strong>‚Äù), including the processing of any files, messages or other content submitted through Services accounts (collectively, ‚Äú<strong>Customer Data</strong>‚Äù). The organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Customer Agreement (‚Äú<strong>Customer</strong>‚Äù) controls their instance of the Services (their ‚Äú<strong>Workspace</strong>‚Äù) and any associated Customer Data.</p>
<p>To support delivery of our Services, Emsisoft may engage and use data processors with access to certain Customer Data (each, a "<strong>Subprocessor</strong>").</p>

<li><strong>Customer Data</strong>. Customers or individuals granted access to a Workspace by a Customer (‚Äú<strong>Authorized Users</strong>‚Äù) may submit Customer Data to Emsisoft when using the Services:</li>

<li>Other data, which includes all information that is required for us to provide our services. This is controlled by us.</li>

<li><em>Log data</em>.

<p>We also make use of a unique hardware identifier that authenticates your computer in our server systems. Without this information we wouldn‚Äôt, for example, be able to tell if a license is being used correctly, or if an attacker is flooding our systems with fake data.</p></td>

For example, remote monitoring and management providers who offer services to remotely configure and monitor the Services.

<h2 class="Section__heading">You might ask...</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Where does Emsisoft store user information?</dt>
<dd>Our main user database is stored on our own servers at a <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/" target="_blank">Hetzner</a> high security data center in Germany. Only our CEO has full access to it (with backup persons in case of an emergency).</dd>
<dt>How does Emsisoft store my credit card data?</dt>
<dd>We don‚Äôt store any credit card information, only our e-commerce partners do (<a href="https://www.cleverbridge.com/" target="_blank">Cleverbridge AG</a>, <a href="https://www.2checkout.com/" target="_blank">2Checkout Inc</a>) and they comply with crazy high security standards.</dd>
<dt>What kind of personal information does Emsisoft store?</dt>
<dd>Generally the least amount of data required to operate our services. We only store information that you provide us, such as your name, email address and other data that you create or send through our systems. We have no use for your postal address, your exact location or even your real name. Feel free to use a nickname.</dd>
<dt>What kind of personal information does the software send to Emsisoft on a regular basis?</dt>
<dd>Your user account data and computer name (to verify your license), your public IP (as it defines your public communication endpoint), your operating system (to get you the right update files), your hardware identifier (a custom calculated hash value that uniquely identifies your computer in our systems for most communications).
<br><br>Also optionally (you can disable these in the settings): the checksum value of files that were detected on your computer (to verify them against known false positives), the names of detected malware and blocked hosts (for statistics and quality assurance), and crash reports that contain extensive technical information of the computer‚Äôs current state during a software crash (allows us to find the crashing line of code quickly, may contain your Windows username and computer name), your software settings, logs and events if you are connected with MyEmsisoft (may contain your Windows username and computer name).</dd>
<dt>Which of my files are being sent to Emsisoft?</dt>
<dd>None without your knowledge. When the software finds a suspicious file (such as an .exe program file) that should be analyzed by the Emsisoft Lab, it asks for your permission to send it in. You can also submit files manually at any time.</dd>
<dt>Which of my computer activities does Emsisoft track?</dt>
<dd>Our software only logs activities that are relevant to your computer security, such as initial checks of newly installed programs that may be dangerous. We don‚Äôt track any documents that you use, unless they contain malware and trigger an alert. Different to other antivirus programs, our technology does not require the tracking of any website addresses that you navigate to. </dd>
