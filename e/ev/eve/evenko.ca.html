Any changes to the Policy can be found at this URL. It is your responsibility to check the Policy periodically for changes.

	Montr√©al (Qu√©bec) H3C 5L2</p><br>
<p><br>
	<strong>General Statement of Privacy and Protection of Personal Information</strong><br><br>
	evenko takes your privacy and security of personal information very seriously. We have provided a secure environment and this strict Policy that describes the limited ways the information is used and the limited access to such information.</p><br>
<p><br>
	<strong>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</strong><br><br>
	This Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (‚ÄúPersonal Information‚Äù) and other information gathered by evenko when you are using or accessing the Services. This Policy also covers evenko‚Äôs treatment of any Personal Information that evenko may share with its business partners or other third parties under very limited circumstances.<br><br>
	This Policy does not apply to the general practices and treatment of information by third parties that evenko does not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites or services that you elect to access through the Services (‚ÄúThird Party Services‚Äù), or to individuals that evenko does not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.<br><br>
	Without limiting the generality of the preceding paragraph, evenko may use third-party ticket vendors (‚ÄúTicket Vendors‚Äù) for certain events, such as Admission and TicketPro, and this Policy does not cover information submitted to these Ticket Vendors that evenko does not control. However, these Ticket Vendors may transfer to evenko certain Personal Information such as your email address, but only if you consent to such sharing by the Ticket Vendor at their website or through the use of their services. Furthermore, in the event of a cancellation, postponement, or other significant change to an event for which you purchased tickets through a Ticket Vendor, evenko may request your full contact information in order to inform you of the change in the event information. In such a case, we will not use this Personal Information for any other purpose.<br><br>
	Finally, this Policy does not cover any Personal Information you send to evenko via any non-secured mode of communications such as email, instant messenger or Twitter, as communications via these methods may be subject to interception, loss, or alteration. We encourage you to carefully examine what Personal Information you send to evenko via these methods.</p><br>
<p><br>
	<strong>No Collection of Personal Information </strong><br><br>
	evenko does not, as a matter of course, gather any of your Personal Information while you are using the Services, unless you are asked to provide such information, for example by signing up to the mailing list. Where you have provided such information, it will only be used for the stated purpose.<br><br>
	Personal Information may be entered into the Website or App when you wish to connect to a third party service integrated into the Website or App, such as Facebook or Twitter (the ‚ÄúIntegrated Third Party Services‚Äù) but this information is not in any way collected or stored by evenko, and it is only used for the stated purpose, to sign in to the Integrated Third Party Service.</p><br>
<p><br>
	<strong>Collection of Personal Information through the Ticketing System</strong><br><br>
	When you use the Ticketing System to purchase tickets, evenko collects the following Personal Information: name, email address, credit card information, and billing information including address and phone number. This information is only used for the following purposes: credit card processing; contacting you in the event of a cancellation, postponement, or other significant change to an event; and advertising or marketing purposes, but only upon your consent.</p><br>
<p><br>
	<strong>Security of Information</strong><br><br>
	We use only industry best practices in keeping any data collected secure. This includes the HTTPS / SSL / TLS (Secure Socket Layer) protocol for all ticket-purchasing transactions and for authentication and data transfer to Integrated Third-Party Services. In addition, evenko uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services, and these vendors have been selected for their high standards of security.</p><br>
<p><br>
	<strong>Limited Gathering of Information for Statistical and Security Purposes</strong><br><br>
	evenko automatically collects certain information using a third-party analytics program, <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, to help us understand how our users use the Services, but none of this information identifies you personally. For example, each time you visit the Website or otherwise use the Services, we automatically collect your IP address, browser and computer type, access times, the web page from which you came, and the web page(s) you access (as applicable). We use this information only to better understand your needs and the needs of the Services users in the aggregate. evenko also makes use of information gathered for statistical purposes to keep track of the number of visits to the Website and which pages on the Website with a view to introducing improvements.</p><br>
<p><br>
	Your IP address and other relevant information may be used in order to trace any fraudulent or criminal activity, or any activity in violation of the Terms of Service.</p><br>
<p><br>
	<strong>Non-disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties</strong><br><br>
	Except as provided in the next paragraphs, evenko does not divulge any Personal Information gathered via the Services to third parties. Moreover, evenko does not sell any information regarding its users to third parties. Only the employees, representatives, subcontractors, or officers of evenko are responsible for the management and development of the Services, and only these individuals have access to the information collected there. These employees, representatives, subcontractors, or officers all have been instructed to comply with the Policy.<br><br>
	Notwithstanding anything in the Policy to the contrary, we may share any information we have collected about you or that you have submitted: (1) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims or demands; (2) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person; (3) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding situations that involve abuse of the Services infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of the Website infrastructure or the Services generally); (4) to a parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with evenko (in which case we will require such entities to honour this Policy); (5) if evenko is acquired by or merged with another entity (in which case we will require such entity to assume our obligations under this Policy, or inform you that you are covered by a new privacy policy); (6) when you explicitly consent to the providing of such information to third parties, such as our business partners, when it will only be used for the stated purpose.<br><br>
	In addition, evenko uses certain Integrated Third Party Services to augment the Services. Personal Information is transferred from evenko to the operators of these Integrated Third Party Services, but only to the extent required in order for them to function properly, and only upon your express submission of such information.<br><br>
	Finally, evenko may transfer your email address to Facebook, but only for the purpose of creating a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/341425252616329">Facebook Custom Audience</a>, in order to serve advertisements on Facebook that may be of interest to you.
