                <h4>Online Information Collection</h4>
                <p>When you use our website, EverBank collects information in several ways:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                	<li>If you use online banking services, we collect and use information as described in the EverBank Consumer Privacy Notice.</li>
                	<li>EverBank collects and uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with its servers and to administer the website. An IP address is like a telephone number for a computer on the Internet. Just as one can locate a phone number in the telephone book, computers can locate an IP address using a Domain Name Service Server. EverBank uses your IP address and information transmitted from your computer to help identify your computer and browser as you move throughout the EverBank website, and to gather general information such as where your Internet Service Provider is located or the type of service that you have. In many cases, this allows EverBank to present a convenient, more customized website to you.</li>
                	<li>Our website and our service providers may over time use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about which computers and browsers access our website, and to keep track of you as you move through our website and third party websites that have a business relationship with our service providers. Cookies are small text files or text identifiers that are placed on your computer by EverBank and many other websites. EverBank and our service providers use this information for a number of reasons, including to deliver content specific to your interests, provide access to our secure banking functions, assist with website traffic reporting (such as reporting unique visitor counts), provide client support, respond to your inquiries (including through the use of live chat or video session technologies), measure and report the level of engagement with EverBank advertisements on this and other websites, and provide you with advertisements tailored to your interests (also known as “Targeted Advertising”).  In most cases, the information collected from cookies does not contain personally identifying information, nor do we combine the information with personally identifying information. However, we may use cookies to collect personally identifying information to authenticate and/or remember user name upon login. If you choose, you may set your web browser to warn you each time before it accepts a cookie and allow you to choose whether you want to accept the cookie. You may also choose to obtain software that operates in conjunction with your browser to control cookie acceptance. Some portions of the EverBank website use cookies to provide you with a secure environment for certain financial transactions. These features may not work properly if you restrict the use of cookies on the website.</li>
                    <li class="last">EverBank also collects information that you provide to us through your use of the website and its features (including live chat or video sessions) to provide client support and to respond to your inquiries.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h4>Information Security</h4>
                <p>Protecting your information is important to EverBank. We've instituted policies, procedures, employee training and communication programs designed for the purpose of protecting your information. Some examples of how EverBank protects your information include the following safeguards that EverBank applies to nonpublic personal information (NPI), as that term is defined and regulated under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. § 6809(4)):</p>
                <ul class="list">
                	<li>Restricting access to NPI to only those persons with a business need to know the information in order to process or service client account(s).</li>
                	<li>Contractually requiring third parties doing business with EverBank to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws.</li>
                	<li class="last">Maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable federal and state standards to safeguard NPI.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By using our online services, you acknowledge and agree that you will not, under any circumstances, disclose your EverBank Online Financial Center password  by telephone or any other means to any person, including any person claiming to represent us.  Of course, you may supply a security code to an EverBank representative if you have initiated the call to a number supplied by EverBank.  No person from the EverBank family of companies will ever ask you for your Online Financial Center password. You are responsible for all transactions made or authorized using your username and password. You agree that if you give your username or password to anyone or fail to safeguard their secrecy, you do so at your own risk. </p>
                <br>

                <h4>Sharing Information</h4>
                <p>We may share information that we collect online and with trusted third parties according to the terms described in our Consumer Privacy Notice, including for purposes of providing client support and responding to your inquiries (including through the use of chat or video-based technologies). Third party service providers with whom we share personally identifiable information are contractually obligated to keep the information confidential and to use the information only to provide the services we have asked them to perform.</p>
                <p>For a description of how EverBank may share information collected from consumers who have applied for or obtained a consumer product or service from us, please refer to our Consumer Privacy Notice.</p>
                <p>We will release specific information about you if we are compelled to do so to comply with valid legal processes such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, or a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency, or in the situation where we, in good faith, believe such information is necessary to prevent harm to you or others or to protect EverBank's interests in a dispute with you. As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, we might sell or buy online businesses or other assets. In such transactions, information about clients often is among the transferred assets. Accordingly, in the event that EverBank or any of its assets is acquired by a third party, such information may be one of the transferred assets.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h4>Public Forums</h4>
                <p>The EverBank website may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should not disclose your personal information. EverBank is not responsible for content posted by third parties to public forums. EverBank reserves the right to discontinue offering public forums at any time and for any reason.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Encrypted Email</h4>
                <p>Encrypted email not only provides authentication but also protects your privacy. Encryption software "scrambles" the message so that only the intended recipient can read the message. Encrypted email often supports a digital signature within the same process. When combined, encryption and a digital signature allows you to obtain both authentication and privacy. EverBank encourages and supports the use of encrypted messages for communication with EverBank. EverBank banking account holders have access from within the EverBank Online Financial Center to an encrypted, secure web-based email system. That system will allow you to communicate via a secured channel with EverBank Client Solutions Specialists.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Fraud and Other Internet Risks</h4>
                <p>EverBank maintains client authentication procedures to protect your personal information and account from identity theft. These procedures are for your protection. If you suspect a website is "spoofing" or pretending to be an EverBank website, do not enter personal information but instead please contact us using the "Contact Us" function on this site, or send an email to <a href="mailto:fraud@everbank.com"><strong>fraud@everbank.com</strong><span class="e-mail"></span></a>.</p>
      			<br>

                <h4>Information Collected in Surveys or Contests</h4>    
      			<p>From time to time, EverBank's website may use online surveys or run contests that ask you for contact information (such as your email address) and demographic information (e.g., zip code, age or income level). EverBank uses this contact and demographic data to send you information about EverBank and promotional material from certain partners. To request that we not send you information about EverBank and other promotional materials, see the "How to Refuse Communications" subsection below.</p>      
                <br>

                <h4>Other Information Collection</h4>
				<p>Demographic and profile data is also collected at EverBank's website. EverBank uses this data to tailor its visitor website experience, providing you content which EverBank believes may be of interest to you, and to display content based on your preferences.</p>
              	<br>

                <h4>Links to Other Websites</h4>
               	<p>The EverBank website may contain links to other websites. EverBank is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of non-EverBank websites. Please review the privacy statement found on each of these sites when linking through.</p>
               	<br>

                <h4>How to Refuse Communications</h4>
               	<p>EverBank's website provides you with the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from EverBank and its partners. If you do not wish to receive future communications, or you no longer wish to receive EverBank's services, you may request that EverBank remove your information from its database.</p>
                <p>You can refer to the EverBank Consumer Privacy Notice for more information on your right to request that we not share certain aspects of your information. Please contact 855.260.8856 or <a href="mailto:privacy@everbank.com"><strong>privacy@everbank.com</strong><span class="e-mail"></span></a> with any questions, concerns, or to exercise your right to request that we not share certain aspects of your information.</p>
                <p>Many of our service providers who over time use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your online activities for the purposes of Targeted Advertising and ad measurement and reporting, on both our website and third party websites with which they have a business relationship, offer you the ability to opt out of that collection of your information.  For more information about how to opt out of such collection, please visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">aboutads.info/choices<span class="new"></span></a>.  We do not currently respond to web browser “do not track” signals; if we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Online Privacy Practices Statement.  For more information on do not track, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.org" target="_blank">allaboutdnt.org<span class="new"></span></a>.</p>
