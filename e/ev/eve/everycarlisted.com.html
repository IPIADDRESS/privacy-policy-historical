    </tbody></table>
    <p class="style1">Idearc collects personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide to us. For example, Idearc may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information (such as name, address, e-mail address and telephone number). If you purchase a product or service, Idearc may ask you to provide additional information such as your credit card information. If you register for the SuperGuarantee<span class="smark">℠</span> Program, Idearc will ask you to provide additional information about any service appointment you register and may track your searches and any registrations, claims and ratings/reviews you file on This Website.  If you file a claim under the SuperGuarantee<span class="smark">℠</span> Program or apply for the Superpages LocalServe<span class="smark">℠</span> Program, Idearc may ask you to provide additional information such as your Social Security number.  Finally, in some cases (for example, if you register with us or sign-in on This Website or purchase a product or service) Idearc may also ask you to provide other information such as a personal ID, password, security question and answer, and birthday.
	</p><p class="style1">If you choose to use an available referral service on This Website (e.g., to send a postcard, listing, page link, contest invitation, etc.), we will ask for certain personal information from the recipient (e.g., the recipient´s name, e-mail address, mobile telephone number) and your name and e-mail address.  Idearc uses the personally identifiable referral information you provide to facilitate this communication on a one-time basis, and may also store and use such personally identifiable information for analysis purposes (e.g., tracking the success of the referral feature). </p> 
<p class="style1">In addition, as you (and other users) browse This Website, our web servers automatically collect certain information about such visits (usually through the use of <a href="#Cookies">cookies</a>, JavaScript tags, clear .gif files --also known as "web beacons"-- and the analysis of http headers), such as the user´s IP address, the user´s domain name, the user´s browser type, the user´s user agent, how many users visit This Website, which pages the user visits and for how long, the date and time the user accesses This Website, the Internet address of the site from which the user directly linked to This Website and the links on This Website on which the user clicks.  In addition, Idearc may collect certain search parameters relating to searches conducted by the user which are not entered by the user.</p>  
<p class="style1">In some cases, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information that you provide, such as search parameters in connection with a search you conduct through This Website, ratings and reviews, and zip code.</p>
<p class="style1">To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand This Website's capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future.  We will update this Privacy Policy as our practices change to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.
 <br>
    </p>
    <p class="style2">        <strong>How does Idearc use information collected on This Website? </strong></p>
    <p class="style1">        When users supply personally identifiable information about themselves for a specific purpose (for example, to register to use a feature on This Website, to purchase a product or service, to obtain a free listing, to register for a program or to use a feature of a program, to receive information, or to apply for a job), we may use such information for such purpose.
	</p><p class="style1">
We also may use personally identifiable information users provide as we would use the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner. For example, we may use such personally identifiable information to assess your credit rating, to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a non-published number), to contact you in connection with a program you are participating in, user reviews and/or to evaluate your service needs, and to contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. When users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a feature on This Website, we may also use such personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of such feature. (For example, if you register to use the personalized directory service, we may use the personally identifiable information you provide to provide you with a more personalized and useful service, and if you create a review of a business on This Website, we may publish your initials, city and state in connection with such review.) When users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion that we may run on This Website, we may use such information to administer such contest, sweepstakes or promotion and to notify winners.
  	</p>
<p class="style1">We may also use personally identifiable information you provide to communicate with you (e.g., to send you e-mails) and to otherwise serve you.  For example, we may use your name and e-mail address to send you e-mails to (a) provide information regarding our company, marketing information about products and services, and newsletters, (b) conduct online surveys, (c) confirm your registration on This Website, a service registration, or orders placed online and (d) otherwise communicate with you.  However, you may request not to receive (i.e., "opt-out" of receiving) commercial e-mail messages (the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service) from us (on a category-by-category basis), by clicking on <a href="http://www.idearcmedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page.  If you have previously opted out of receiving commercial e-mail messages related to one or more categories, you may cancel your request to opt-out of (i.e., consent to receive commercial e-mail messages from us related to) such categories (on a category-by-category basis) by clicking on <a href="http://www.idearcmedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page.  Please note that we reserve the right to send certain types of e-mail messages that are not subject to opt-out (see information about <a href="#email">e-mails</a>, below) to online users, including those who have opted out of receiving commercial e-mail messages.</p>
 <p> In addition, Idearc may use personally identifiable information you provide and information Idearc automatically collects through this website (and may combine personally identifiable information you provide with information Idearc automatically collects through This Website and non-personally identifiable information you knowingly provide) as it deems appropriate to protect its property or other rights (for example, to enforce any policies or contractual provisions regarding use of the "ratings and reviews" feature or the "send a listing" feature).</p>
  <p> We use information Idearc automatically collects through This Website to improve This Website, to monitor its performance, to make This Website easier for you and other users to use, and to manage features and programs made available through This Website.  For example, Idearc may use information Idearc automatically collects in the ways described in the section entitled <a href="#Cookies">"What is a cookie and why does Idearc use them?"</a>, below.</p>
  <p class="style2"> <strong>Can I review and request changes to personally identifiable information that I provide through registration forms on This Website?  </strong></p>
    <p class="style1">If you use an available capability on This Website to register with us and create a profile, at any time after you register and create a profile, you may review and request changes to any personally identifiable information you provided through the registration form, by viewing and updating your profile within the application.
    </p><p>In addition, (i) you may request not to receive (i.e., "opt-out" of receiving) commercial e-mail messages from us (on a category-by category basis), by clicking on <a href="http://www.idearcmedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page, and (ii) if you have previously opted out of receiving commercial e-mail messages related to one or more categories, you may cancel your request to opt-out of (i.e., consent to receive commercial e-mail messages from us related to) such categories (on a category-by-category basis) by clicking on <a href="http://www.idearcmedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page.

    <p class="style2">            <strong>Do you sell or provide my information collected through This Website to companies outside of the "Idearc Family?"  </strong></p>
    <p class="style1">We do not sell or disclose personally identifiable information you provide to us through This Website to anyone outside of the "Idearc Family" unless (i) you specifically authorize it, (ii) it is to complete a transaction, service or activity that you initiated or requested, (iii) it is to provide a service on behalf of Idearc (for example, Idearc may contract with an entity outside of the "Idearc Family" to send e-mail messages on behalf of Idearc), in which case such non- "Idearc Family" entities are not permitted to use such information for any purpose other than to provide such service, (iv) it is to assess your credit ranking or report your failure to fulfill your payment obligations in connection with the purchase of (or application to purchase) products or services through This Website,  (v) it is required by law or we believe that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, (vi) we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served, (vii) we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property, or (viii) Idearc transfers all or substantially all of its assets to another entity (in which case Idearc may disclose, sell and/or otherwise provide personally identifiable information to such entity). If you provide personally identifiable information to us in the context of an event Idearc sponsors on This Website with another company, such as a contest, or if you register on a co-sponsored section or feature of This Website, you may also be providing such personally identifiable information to the co-sponsor.  When you provide your personally identifiable information to any third party, Idearc is not responsible for any third party´s use of such personally identifiable information.

Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.</p>
    <p class="style1">You can choose to change your browser settings to disable cookies if you do not want us to establish and maintain a unique User ID. Please be aware that cookies may be required to complete certain functions on This Website, such as ordering products or services, and, also in connection with personalized sections of This website, for example My Superpages.  To disable cookies, see <a href="#setcookies">"Setting Cookie Preferences"</a>, below.</p>
    <p class="style1"> However, you need to understand that some websites/ad serving companies have the ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion, if you reenter the same site on another occasion, or some other site tracked by the ad serving company/network, and specifically provide personal data.</p>
    <p class="style1">Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent ad serving companies from reestablishing history on a user.  The user must either continue to decline cookies each time it reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or opt-out.  When you opt-out, your unique user ID cookie is erased and you are reassigned an anonymous, non-id cookie.  This new cookie tells websites that you have opted out and they will then know not to attempt to assign other cookies to you in the future.  Opt-out cookies do not contain a unique user ID number therefore websites are not able to identify your computer uniquely.</p>
    <p class="style1">Users who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have their browser advise them each time a website attempts to send a cookie to your system.  At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel a cookie. Users who choose to "opt out" after deleting cookies will receive an anonymous/non personally identifiable cookie. <br>
