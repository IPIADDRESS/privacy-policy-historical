            <h1>EVENTup Privacy Policy</h1>

            <h2>Effective Nov. 13, 2012</h2>
            <p>Eventup, Inc. (“EVENTup,” “we” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of www.eventup.com (the “Site”), our mobile application (the “App”), and all services available via the EVENTup Site and App (collectively, the “Services” refers to the Site, the App, and the services available through the Site and App)</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You should consult this policy regularly for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our EVENTup Terms of Service, accessible at http://eventup.com/terms/. </p>

            <h3>Information Collection</h3>
            <p>We may collect information directly and indirectly from users, as well as from third parties. </p>

            <h3>Information We Collect Directly</h3>
            <p>You can browse our Site and download our App without registering.  However to use certain features or conduct certain activities (such as to create a listing, sign up to the Site or make a booking), you must be registered for an EVENTup Account.  In addition, we may collect other information about you when you use certain features, such as information about an event you are planning, etc.</p>
            <p>Registration.  You can register with us by creating an EVENTup account, or by logging in through your social media account.</p>
            <p>EVENTup Account.  To create an EVENTup account, you must provide us with your name, company name (if applicable), phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and venue postal addresses, as applicable.  </p>
            <p>Social Networking Account.  You may also register to use the Services by logging into your account with certain third party social media or social networking services ("SNS") (including, but not limited to, Facebook).  For example, if you login in through Facebook, we will ask your permission to collect your public profile information, friend list, email address, birthday and personal description.  If you don’t grant us permission you can’t log-in to the Services via Facebook.  Once you’ve logged in through Facebook, we may ask you for additional profile information, as noted below.</p>
            <p>Profile and Other Information.  Once you have registered with us, we may collect additional, optional information from you, including your preferences and certain demographic information, the information you choose to include in your profile, and, if applicable, any venue or event details you provide.  From time-to-time, we may also run contests, surveys and promotions, and if you choose to participate we may collect additional information from you.</p>

            <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
            <p>When you visit the Site or use the App or Services, we automatically collect information about you (via cookies, log files, pixel tags, third party analytics tools, and other methods), including IP address; browser type and operating system; referring URL (or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site); location information; pages of our Site or App that you visit and the time spent on those pages; the links you click; information you search for; access times and dates, device ID or other identifier; language information; and other statistics.  </p>

            <h3>How We Use the Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>We use the information we collect as follows:</p>
            <p>To provide our Services, complete your transactions, fulfil your orders, respond to you, and for other customer service purposes.</p>
            <p>To tailor the content and information that we may send or display to you, to offer location customization, and personalized help and instructions, to display targeted ads on our Site and App, as well as on third party websites, and to otherwise personalize your experiences while using our Services.</p>
            <p>For marketing and promotional purposes. For example, we may send our customers news and newsletters, special offers, and promotions, or to otherwise contact you about products or information we think may interest you.  </p>
            <p>To better understand how users access and use our Services, both on an aggregated and individualized basis, in order to improve our Services and respond to user desires and preferences, and for other research and analytical purposes.</p>

            <h3>Cookies and Tracking</h3>
            <p>We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Services. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf).  </p>
            <p>Do Not Track. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of certain targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third Party Ad Network section.</p>
            <p>Cookies. Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor usage and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Service and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can control how your browser accepts cookies by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services. </p>
            <p>Local Storage Objects. We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) to store your preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions.  </p>
            <p>Clear GIFs. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Services to, among other things, track the activities of users, and to help us manage content and compile statistics about usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.</p>
            <p>Third-party Analytics. We use third party analytics tools, including Google Analytics, to collect, monitor and analyze this information in order to improve functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Services to our visitors' needs. Accordingly, usage data is shared with Google, which has its own privacy policy addressing how it uses such information. We encourage you to review this privacy policy to understand how Google uses such information. </p>

            <h3>Targeted Advertising and Ad Networks </h3>
            <p>We (or our third party service providers) may send users targeted ads, based on location and activities within our Site and your use of our Services.  We may also participate in third-party ad networks, such as Google AdSense and allow third parties to use cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies to collect usage information, to display targeted ads to you on our Site and App, and on third party sites, and to track the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.  These third parties may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources.</p>
            <p>For information about Google AdSense, including how to opt out, visit the Google Advertising page. You may also opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”).  For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp and  www.aboutads.info/choice</p>

P lease be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private.

            <h3>International Transfer</h3>
            <p>If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, your information will be transferred to the United States and to other jurisdictions where Eventup or its service providers are located; the privacy laws in these jurisdictions may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.
