<br><br>
We may share personal information with vendors, consultants and other service providers ("Service Providers") who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the Site or the services we provide and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. Such Service Providers do not have any independent right to use or share your personal information apart from performing their work for us. In some cases, the Service Provider may be directly collecting the information from you on our behalf. We may also share personal information with other third parties when you give us your consent to do so. We are not responsible for the actions of Service Providers or other third parties, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these Service Providers or other third parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them. Nothing herein restricts the sharing of aggregate information, which may be shared with third parties without your consent.
<br><br>
We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or legal authorities, to respond to claims, subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also disclose personal information if we believe it is necessary in order to protect the rights, property or safety of EveryTrail, our users, our employees or the public, including without limitation to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of EveryTrail's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

<br><br>
We may disclose or transfer information, including personal information, about you if EveryTrail is acquired by or merged with another company or in any other situation where personal information may be transferred as one of the business assets of EveryTrail. In this event, EveryTrail will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
<br><br>
EveryTrail may display targeted advertisements based on information collected from you or actions you take. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area who are interested in hiking.
<br><br>
EveryTrail does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to such targeted advertising and the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
<br><br>
You understand that when you use the Site and the Services, information you post in connection with your participation in any interactive forums or features on the Site or through the Services, as well as any information you share with individuals through the Site or the Services, will be available to other users and in some cases may be publicly available. We recommend you be cautious about giving out personal information to others or sharing personal information in public or private online forums. We are not responsible for the actions of any third parties with whom you share personal information.
<br><br>

New categories of marketing communications may be added to the Marketing Preferences page from time to time. Users who visit this page can opt out of receiving future marketing communications from these new categories or they can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages they receive.
<br><br>
Notwithstanding any opt-out, we reserve the right to continue sending you certain communications relating to your account and the EveryTrail Services, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the EveryTrail Newsletter, that are considered part of your EveryTrail account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.
<br><br>

We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
