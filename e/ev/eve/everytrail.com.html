<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>EveryTrail takes your privacy seriously. We will not share your personal information with others. We don't spam. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.</p>

<h2>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h2>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>This policy covers how EveryTrail treats personal information that EveryTrail collects and receives, including information related to your past use of EveryTrail products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
</li><li>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that EveryTrail does not own or control, or to people that EveryTrail does not employ or manage.
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p><b>General</b></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>EveryTrail collects personal information when you register with EveryTrail, when you use EveryTrail products or services, when you visit EveryTrail pages or the pages of certain EveryTrail partners, and when you enter promotions. EveryTrail may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.
</li><li>When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, and personal interests. Once you register with EveryTrail and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.
</li><li>* EveryTrail automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, EveryTrail cookie information, and the pages you request
</li><li>EveryTrail uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b></p>
<p>EveryTrail does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
</p><ul>
<li>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with EveryTrail under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help EveryTrail communicate with you about offers from EveryTrail and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
</li><li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims
</li><li>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of EveryTrail's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
</li><li>We transfer information about you if EveryTrail is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, EveryTrail will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
</li><li>EveryTrail displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area who are interested in hiking.
</li><li>EveryTrail does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
</li><li>EveryTrail advertisers include Outdoor industry companies (such as equipment manufacturers, and travel agents) and non-outdoor industry companies (such as airlines, and car manufacturers)
</li><li>EveryTrail works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business
</li></ul>

<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>EveryTrail may set and access EveryTrail cookies on your computer
</li><li>EveryTrail lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to EveryTrail's cookies.
</li><li>EveryTrail uses web beacons to access EveryTrail cookies inside and outside our network of web sites and in connection with EveryTrail products and services.
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<h2>Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences</h2>
<p><b>General</b></p>
<ul>
<li>You can edit your EveryTrail Account Information, including your marketing preferences, at any time.
</li><li>New categories of marketing communications may be added to the Marketing Preferences page from time to time. Users who visit this page can opt out of receiving future marketing communications from these new categories or they can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages they receive.
</li><li>We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the EveryTrail service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the EveryTrail Newsletter, that are considered part of your EveryTrail account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.
<p><b>Confidentiality and Security</b></p>
<p>We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.</p>

<p><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b></p>
