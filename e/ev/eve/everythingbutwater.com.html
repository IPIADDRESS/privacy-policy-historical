<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<div class="cntnr-txt">
	<h2>Collection of Information &amp; Use Thereof</h2>

    <p>It is Everything But Water's policy to respect and protect the privacy of visitors to Everything But Water's website. Accordingly, Everything But Water (“EBW”) DOES NOT extract without permission personal information about its visitors or their computer at any time. Though EBW does analyze information about our visitors as a group to make our website better, no visitor is individually identified when we do this.</p>
	<p>EBW will collect personal information such as names, home addresses, e-mail addresses, age, etc., but only when a visitor voluntarily gives it to us in the process of subscribing to the EBW newsletters, placing orders or registering with the EBW website. This information is used internally by EBW to fulfill your requests and for marketing and research purposes.  If you decide to opt in to our newsletter mailing list, you will receive e-mails such as company news, updates, product or service information, promotions, etc. However, you may opt out (unsubscribe) at any time by clicking the unsubscribe button at the bottom of all e-mails that you will receive from us.</p>
	<p>EBW will NOT sell, rent or otherwise transmit a visitor's personal information to any third party unless EBW asks for and receives the visitor's permission at the time the personal information is collected. The only exceptions to this policy are special cases where EBW has reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (whether intentionally or unintentionally) with EBW's rights or property or anyone else who may be harmed by such actions, or if required by law.</p>
	<p>EBW does however, share aggregate information about the users of EBW's website with our advertisers, business partners, sponsors and certain others. As mentioned above, this aggregate information is used to develop, improve and customize EBW's website to better serve visitors to our website. Where EverythingButWater.com's information collection activities involve children, EverythingButWater.com provides special privacy protections as outlined below.</p>

    <h2>For Children Under 13:</h2>
	<p>Never provide any information about yourself on the Internet without your parent's/guardian's permission. Please read EBW's Parental Consent Policy (see below) with a parent or guardian before you submit any information to this site. EBW requires your parents'/guardian's written permission for you to provide us with certain information required to get the EBW Newsletter, order subscriptions or enter certain clubs etc. on the EBW websites.</p>

    <h2>Parental Consent Policy</h2>
	<p>EBW is committed to protecting the online privacy of children. In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, EBW will not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13) without first obtaining parental consent. Its full compliance with COPPA notwithstanding, EBW has designed its website with the intent of providing an age-appropriate experience for all.</p>
	<p>Prior to providing any personally identifiable information (name, email address, address, phone number etc.), either by placing an order for merchandise, setting up a EverythingButWater.com account, or participating in any other activity offered through the EverythingButWater.com site, children under the age of thirteen (13) must have a parent or legal guardian complete and return  a Parental Consent Form to EverythingButWater.com - EBW, 7353 Greenbriar Parkway, Orlando, FL 32819; or by fax to: <span class="tel">407.351.0106</span>. The consent form states that the child's “Parent” or “Legal Guardian,” by his or her signature, consents to the collection and transfer of the child's personally identifiable information. Consent may be revoked by completing an “EBW Revocation of Parental Consent Form” and sending it to the address or fax number above.</p>
	<p>EBW also adheres to the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) Guidelines on Internet advertising regarding solicitations to children under thirteen (13). EBW encourages parents/guardians to supervise their children appropriately in exploring the Internet. EBW recommends that parents/guardians monitor and supervise the online activities of their children and consider using available parental control tools which can prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission.</p>
	<p>Should a parent not permit EverythingButWater.com's use or collection of personally identifiable information, or should s/he instruct EBW to delete personally identifiable information, a child's participation in those EverythingButWater.com activities for which the personally identifiable information has been requested will not be possible.</p>

    <h2>Correspondence &amp; Weekly Newsletters</h2>
    <p>EBW uses automated e-mail systems to e-mail weekly newsletters and to collect and answer correspondence from our visitors. While EBW may be unable to individually answer each piece of correspondence, we do read all of them!</p>
	<p>EBW tries to make it easy for visitors to contact EverythingButWater.com and we provide easy instructions on our website on how you can either edit information that you previously provided (such as your address) or remove yourself from automated messages generated by EBW. Should you have a technical problem doing this please contact <a href="mailto:web@everythingbutwater.com?subject=Web Comments from EverythingButWater.com">web@everythingbutwater.com</a>.</p>
	
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
	<p>EBW uses “cookie” technology to enhance a visitor's online experience by making it easier to navigate through our website or to make an activity work better.</p>
	<p>Cookies are small pieces of information or files that a website puts on a computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow a computer to “remember” information from our website for future use. EBW does not use cookies to collect or record personally identifiable information about any visitor to EverythingButWater.com. EBW uses information collected by cookies to learn about our visitors' preferences, so that we can make our website better. The information is aggregated to better understand our visitors as a whole, and is not associated with any single.</p>

    <h2>Requests for Feedback</h2> 
    <p>EverythingButWater.com may request feedback from visitors regarding an activity or piece of content on the EverythingButWater.com website. Feedback is used for internal purposes only, and any personally identifiable information that may be submitted is deleted.</p>

    <h2>Advertisements and Links</h2>
	<p>EverythingButWater.com may include advertisements and/or links to websites operated by third parties that are not sponsors and are not affiliated with EBW. EBW attempts to ensure that external links are operational and that they house content that is valuable to our site users. However, EBW cannot guarantee the appropriateness of any external content to which we link, nor to the appropriateness of sites that in turn link to such external content. Therefore, EBW holds no responsibility for the content, practices, or information provided or requested on websites operated by third parties. Further, advertisements on and links to or from EverythingButWater.com do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by EBW of the content, policies, practices or products or services offered on these websites or those linked to them. EverythingButWater.com will always designate advertisements as such and will notify visitors when they are clicking an external link and thereby leaving EverythingButWater.com.</p>
	<p>Parents/guardians should check each website's privacy policy and terms of use in order to understand their policies and practices regarding the collection and use of personally identifiable information. EBW also suggests that parents/guardians review the privacy policies of all websites that their children visit, including those websites linking to or from the EBW websites. Information provided to those websites will be subject to the privacy policies of those other sites, over which EBW has no control.</p>

	<h2>Security</h2>
	<p>Maintaining the security of all personally identifiable information associated with EverythingButWater.com visitors is of utmost concern to us. EBW exercises great care and implements a variety of technologies to make the EBW website as secure as possible against unauthorized access and to protect the information visitors choose to provide to us. EBW periodically reviews and updates these measures. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be one hundred percent (100%) secure. As a result, while EBW strives to protect a visitor's personal information, EBW cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us or from our online products or services, and a visitor does so at his/her own risk. EBW uses the industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption when credit card information is transmitted to us.</p>

	<h2>Privacy Policy and Use of Site</h2>
	<p>By using this Web site for any purpose, you certify your understanding and acceptance of our Privacy Policy. Any subsequent changes to this Policy will be posted to this page and designated as such. Any future Policy changes will apply only to information collected from the date of such changes.</p>
	
	<h2>Review and Deletion of Personal Information</h2>
