Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</span></strong><span style="color: black;"><br>
<br>
EVERYCALL.US allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements to the EVERYCALL.US Website. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on EVERYCALL.US. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.<br>
<br>
EVERYCALL.US does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks EVERYCALL.US to show an advertisement to a certain audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the characteristics of the audience they are attempting to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of EVERYCALL.US, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.<br>
<br>
We recommend you consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. EVERYCALL.US's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.<br>
