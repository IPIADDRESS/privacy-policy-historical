		<li style="list-style: none;">
		  <h3>IP Addresses</h3>
		  <p>IP Addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. Your IP address is stored in our user registration databases when you register with Everywhere Magazine.</p>

		  <ul>
			<li>You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.</li>
			<li>If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Everywhere Magazine products or services that require you to “sign in,” and you may not be able to take full advantage of the Everywhere Magazine service.</li>

	  </ul>
	  <h2>Information sharing and disclosure</h2>
	  <ul>
		<li>When you post a photo, article, postcard or comment, your Everywhere Magazine ID or alias that you are posting under is visible to other users.</li>
		<li>If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Everywhere Magazine does not rent or sell your personal information.</li>
		<li>Generally, Everywhere Magazine does not share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies without your consent, except when compelled by subpoenas, warrants, court orders or legal process.</li>
		<li>It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including without limitation, fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Everywhere Magazine’s terms of use, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. We will transfer information about you if Everywhere Magazine is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Everywhere Magazine will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Everywhere Magazine web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Everywhere Magazine may share demographic information with business partners, such as “53% of users who regularly use Everywhere Magazine are between 18 and 24” or the like. No personally identifiable information will ever be used without your permission (i.e. we will ask you for a quote or testimonial).</li>
		<li>When you upload a photo to Everywheremag.com we ask for high-resolution images for printing in the magazine; however these high-resolution images are not available to the public, only the low-resolution web versions not suitable for printing are visible.</li>

		<li>You can delete your Everywhere Magazine account at any time by clicking “Edit your profile” on your travelogue page; however, please note that your identification, billing and contact information may remain in Everywhere Magazine’s records for some period.</li>
		<li>We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.</li>
		<li>Your Everywhere Magazine profile information is password-protected.</li>
		<li>In certain areas, Everywhere Magazine uses SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions.</li>
	  </ul>
