                visit.

                In order to use certain features of the Site and Services you
                may be asked to register. Any Personally Identifiable
                Information which is required and that you choose to provide
                within the registration process will not be disclosed on our
                Site. Once registered, you may provide additional information
                in various areas of the site. Providing additional information
                beyond the fields in the registration process is entirely
                optional and such information may be visible to the public.

                By providing your email address while signing up for Eventful

                disclose or market Personally Identifiable Information
                obtained through our Site to others. Based upon your opt in
