            		<li><span>8.1.1. General: </span> This Website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies. The information on your use of the Website created by a cookie, will usually be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The Website uses Google Analytics in conjunction with the option „_anonymizeIP()“. This means, that your IP-address will be shortened by Google beforehand within member states of the EU or other members of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases the whole IP-address will be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. Any connection with a specific person is therefore precluded and personal data immediately deleted. The IP-address transmitted by your browser within the use of Google Analytics will not be combined with other data held by Google.</li>
