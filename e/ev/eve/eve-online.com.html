<p>Moreover, the processing of gameplay information furthers CCP’s legitimate interests of reviewing, researching and developing our Services.</p>

<p>The monitoring of your Game hardware furthers CCP’s legitimate interest of monitoring whether you are using unauthorized software in contravention of the applicable Terms of Service.</p>

<h3>FOR MARKETING PURPOSES</h3>

<p>We may use your personal data for marketing purposes, based on our legitimate interest. For example, we may use your e-mail address to send you messages about new offerings and features of CCP and to market and offer CCP’s products and services which we think you might be interested in. </p>

<p>We may also ask for your consent to send you marketing for the products and services of our business partners. When the collection and processing of your personal data is based on your consent, you can always withdraw the consent. All communications relating to such withdrawal shall be directed to our Data Protection Team. </p></li>

We may also transfer your contact data to third party social media platforms, who provide us with marketing services.   </p>

<p>CCP may disclose your personal data to law enforcement or other government officials, as CCP, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible crimes or to respond to judicial, regulatory, agency or similar inquiries.

<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Services changes, we may transfer your personal data to the new owner.</p>

<h3>International transfer of data</h3>

<p>The data we collect from you may be transferred to, stored and processed by CCP companies at one or more destinations both inside and outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), including the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China for any purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Our contractors, consultants and suppliers may also be located outside the EEA.</p>

<p>However, we only transfer your personal data to countries outside the EEA if such transfer is permitted under the applicable privacy legislation. The transfer between CCP companies is based on Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission.</p></li>
<li><h2>How long do we keep your data?</h2>

<p>Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirements, we are committed to retaining your personal data only for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the personal data was collected.</p>

<p>We will however delete all data that is no longer necessary after a reasonable period. We will also delete your data upon your request. We may keep your information for longer for research or statistical purposes. If we do, we will make sure your information is anonymised and non-traceable to you as a person. We will also keep it for longer if we may not delete it for legal or regulatory reasons.</p></li>
<li><h2>How is your data protected?</h2>

<p>We take precautions to protect your personal data from loss, unauthorized access, copying, use, modification or disclosure.</p>

<p>CCP’s security measures include industry-standard technology and equipment to help protect your personal data, and we maintain security measures to allow only the appropriate personnel and third parties access to your personal data.</p>

<p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you use/access the Services, you are solely responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask that you not share your password with anyone.</p></li>
<li><h2>How can you exercise your rights provided under data protection legislation?</h2>

<p>CCP is committed to ensuring your rights under the European Data Protection Legislation.</p>

<p>You can view and rectify some elements of your personal data on your online account system, or request that our Data Protection Team rectify your data.</p>

<p>You have the right to access the personal data CCP has collected about you and to be informed about the purpose of its collection. You may also be entitled to a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. Furthermore, you may under certain circumstances and where technically feasible, have the right to request us to transfer your personal data to a third party.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to request us to restrict the processing of your personal data, for example if you object to its processing, but prefer the data not to be erased.</p>

<p>If the processing of your personal data is based on CCP’s legitimate interests, you have the right to object to the processing, following which we must stop the processing unless we demonstrate a compelling legitimate ground for the processing which override your interests.</p>

<p>In certain instances, you have the right to have your personal data erased, such as where the data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which they were collected or otherwise processed, or if you withdraw your consent.</p>

<p>Your rights to access, erasure, restriction and portability of data are however not absolute. In those instances where we cannot accept your request, we will inform you of the reasons why, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions.</p>

<p>Please refer all requests concerning your rights to our Data Protection Team, contactable via <a href="mailto:request@privacy.ccpgames.com">request@privacy.ccpgames.com</a>.</p></li>
<li><h2>Revisions to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>CCP may make changes to this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our legal or regulatory obligations or to the manner in which we process your personal data.</p>

<p>Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective from the time they are posted on the Sites or under our Terms of Services, as applicable.</p></li>
<li><h2>Change of Control</h2>

<p>If CCP experiences a “Change of Control” (defined below), then we may amend our information practices as described in this Privacy Policy. We will disclose your personally identifiable information to the company or other legal entity that succeeds our operation of the Services. The privacy policy of the succeeding legal entity will then govern the personal data that we have collected from you under this Privacy Policy. However, if applicable law prohibits the succeeding legal entity’s privacy policy from governing your personal data, then this Privacy Policy shall continue to govern.
“Change of Control” means any of the following events:</p>

<ul>
<li>a reorganization, merger, consolidation, acquisition or other restructuring involving all or substantially all of our voting securities and/or assets, by operation of law or otherwise;</li>
<li>insolvency;</li>
<li>a general assignment for the benefit of creditors;</li>
<li>appointment of a receiver for our business or assets;</li>
<li>we become subject to any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, whether domestic or foreign; or</li>
<li>our liquidation, voluntarily or otherwise.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><h2>Links to other websites</h2>

<p>The Sites may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for and shall not have any liability arising from the privacy practices or the content of other websites.</p></li>
<li><h2>Questions about our Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how we manage your personal data, please contact our Data Protection Team at <a href="mailto:request@privacy.ccpgames.com">request@privacy.ccpgames.com</a>.</p>
