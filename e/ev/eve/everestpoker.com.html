The group of companies of which Everest is a part includes Everest  and any holding company or subsidiary of Everest or any subsidiary of any such  holding company and any company associated with such holding or subsidiary  (“Group”).<br>
    <br>
    We treat the data that you provide us with as strictly private and it shall  only be used by us, by a member of our Group or by a selected third party who  complies with our high standards of data protection in order to manage the  account which you open with us (“Account”), to create customer profiles, to  ensure the security of the Site and to enable you to use our services. <br>
  <br>
    Please note that you may choose whether or not you wish to permit us, a member  of our Group or one of our partners to use your personal data for marketing  purposes. <br>
  <br>
  Should you require further information or if you have any questions regarding  privacy or confidentiality issues, please contact our <a href="mailto:support@everestpoker.com" target="_blank">Customer Services Team</a>. Please take the time to read  our Privacy Policy carefully.</p></div>
<br>
<br>
<div><strong>1. Your personal data</strong></div>
<br>
<br>
<div>
  <p>The  information we collect enables us to ensure that our customers can enjoy safe and  user-friendly browsing conditions. Our aim is to offer the best possible  services, whilst making sure that betting and gaming on our Site remains a fun  activity!<br>
    <br>
    All references to ‘personal data’ in this Privacy Policy refer to any personal  information about a natural person which enables that individual to be  identified directly or indirectly by reference to the data provided.  Specifically, We collect the following information when you open an Account  with us: first name; surname; gender; date of birth; place of residence; postal  address; email address; phone number; language, currency, passport or ID card  number and secret question. You will also be required to provide login details  of your choice, namely a username, password and an answer to the secret  question which will be kept by us. We additionally require you to provide us  with a payment method and payment details (such as bank transfer, credit card  or another acceptable means of payment) in order that you can credit your  Account. Further, before your first withdrawal of funds from your Account, we  will request that you send us a copy of an official document (e.g. passport,  driving licence or other approved identity document) in order to confirm the  accuracy of the data you have provided. We also compare your internet protocol  (IP) address against your user identification in order to prevent fraudulent  activities and also to create an audit trail. When you make a pre-registration  sign-up and before you fully register as a customer, we request the following  information from you: title, first name, surname, date of birth and email  address. We store this information in order to provide you with a pre-populated  registration form if and when you decide to fully register with us. We require  the above information in order to ensure that you can identify yourself when  using the Site, to ensure that you are of legal age to use our services, to  improve our services to you and to keep you informed regarding any of our  services which may be of interest to you. You have the right to request that we  cease forwarding marketing information about our, and/or our partners',  services to you. You also have the right to access your personal data at any  time in order to make alterations to any personal information that may have  changed or become obsolete. Should you believe that any personal information we  hold for you is incorrect, please email our customer services team at support@everestpoker.com  and we will amend any information found to be incorrect. </p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<div><strong>2. Use of your personal data</strong></div>
<br>
<br>
<div>
  <p>Once your  personal data is submitted to us, it shall be kept securely on our database.<br>
    <br>
We use the email address which you have provided us with to send you an email  welcoming you to Everest. We may send you emails, letters by post and SMS  messages from time to time containing information ranging from special  promotions to technical and other information relating to our services and the  services of our Group companies. Should you wish to unsubscribe from our  mailing list, you can do this easily by either changing your Account settings  or clicking “unsubscribe” on the bottom of the email. If you have agreed to  receive offers from Everest and/or partners on the pre-registration sign-up  page and you later wish to unsubscribe, simply click on the ‘unsubscribe’ link  on the email. Should you wish to unsubscribe from receiving SMS messages, you  can do this easily by following the instructions to unsubscribe in the SMS  message sent to you. Please note that we may from time to time send out service-related  emails announcing, for instance, a temporary suspension of one or more of our  services due to maintenance. IT IS THEREFORE RECOMMENDED THAT YOU DO NOT OPT  OUT OF RECEIVING EMAILS FROM EVEREST. If you have opted in to receive  commercial offers from our select partners, you can unsubscribe from this  mailing list by changing your settings in ‘My Account’ and ‘My Newsletters’.<br>
<br>
As part of our partnership with commercial banks and/or the companies in charge  of verifying the authenticity of credit card or electronic payment processing  data, your personal data is at the disposal of these establishments. However,  these establishments are only entitled to use such information for processing or legal  investigation purposes (for example, in suspected anti-money laundering cases).  We may also enter into partnerships with data processors and companies which  provide security, age verification and identification verification services in  order to improve the efficiency and security of the Site or to comply with  relevant regulations. These companies may have access to your personal data in  order that they can process necessary information data and maintain the  security of the Site. The companies that we choose to carry out these functions  have strict policies regarding privacy of personal data, although we accept no  responsibility for the privacy policies of those companies. We will not  disclose the amount of your winnings or losses to any person or third party  other than to you unless we are required by law to disclose such information to  competent authorities. It is therefore incumbent upon you to declare your  winnings to the relevant authorities if you reside in a country where such  gains are subject to taxation. We reserve the right to pass on to payment  service providers and to public, regulatory or other relevant authorities, all  or any customer personal data held by us if necessary or required in the course  of any legal investigation and/or in circumstances where we reasonably suspect  that fraud or criminal conduct has occurred and in order for us to carry out  our obligations under relevant fraud, anti-money laundering and other applicable  legislation.</p>
  <p>The personal  data submitted by our customers may be stored and/or processed in any country  in which we or our affiliates, suppliers, subsidiaries or agents maintain  facilities. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you give your consent to the  transfer of your personal data outside of your country. Everest is committed to  taking all necessary steps to ensure that whenever personal data is  transferred, such transfer takes place solely within the Group and the Group's  select partners in which companies the standards of privacy and confidentiality  should be of an acceptable standard, irrelevant of location.</p>
Everest  shall in no manner whatsoever be held responsible for the manner in which third  parties process the personal data of our customers. Everest shall only be  responsible for its own Privacy Policy and it does not warrant the standard of  the privacy policies of any of the third parties who may have links placed on  our Sites. We strongly recommend that when you access a new page via a link on  our Site(s) which takes you to an external website, you take time to read  through the privacy policy of the new website which you enter.</div>
<br>
<br>
<div><strong>3. Retention of your personal data</strong></div>
<br>
<br>
<div>
  <p>As our  customer, you or we can close your Account with us at any time. Following  closure of your Account, we will retain your personal data on record for as  long as required by law. We will only use your data should such use be required  by competent authorities in cases of fraud or investigation into any other  illegal activity. This will be the sole exception to use of your personal data  until its complete deletion from our records.</p></div>
<br>
<br>
<div><strong>4. Protection of minors</strong></div>
<br>
<br>
<div>
  <p>The online  betting and gaming services that we offer are strictly prohibited for persons  under 18 years of age or under the age of legal consent for using online  betting and gaming services under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the  person is located. Consequently, minors may not register on our Site and should  not provide us with any personal data. We collect proof of identification from  our customers as part of our age verification process. <br>
    <br>
  Any minor who is found to be gambling on Everest shall have any winnings  confiscated and his/her Account will be immediately blocked. Everest reserves  the right to conduct a security review to validate your identity and age.  Acceptance of our Privacy Policy authorises us to conduct such security reviews  which may include ordering of credit reports or verification of the information  supplied by you against third party databases.</p></div>
<br>

<br>
<div><strong>6. Security</strong></div>
<br>
<br>
<div>
  <p>Everest Gaming (Gibraltar) Limited is a company incorporated in  Gibraltar with company number 105 893  and which has its place of business at Suite  7.3.1, Europort, Europort Road, Gibraltar. Everest is licensed under the  Gambling Act 2005 by the Government of Gibraltar and regulated by the Gibraltar  Gambling Commissioner. Everest uses its best endeavours to protect the confidentiality of your  personal data and to prevent any unauthorised external or internal users from  accessing such information without your consent. However, Everest shall take no  responsibility whatsoever for events beyond its control inclusive of, but not  limited to, acts of god or natural disasters and including power cuts and  strikes.<br>
    <br>
    We are sure that, as our customer, you understand the evolving nature of our  business due to continuous technological innovation and, although we endeavour  to do our best to ensure the protection and privacy of your personal data at  all times, we cannot guarantee that the performance of our service will be free  from error at all times. Should any such error have an effect or consequence on  the privacy of your personal data, we shall not be liable in any manner  whatsoever in damages or otherwise.<br>
  <br>
    We strongly recommend that you do not divulge your personal data to strangers  or third parties during live chat. Remember that your personal data is  sensitive and it’s important to stop and think before passing on personal  information. <br>
    <br>
  <u>Log Files</u><br>
  <br>
    Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes IP  addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages,  platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends,  administer the Site, track user's movement in the aggregate and gather broad  demographic information for aggregate use.<br>
  <br>
  <u>Data Encryption</u><br>
  <br>
    All sensitive data which is transmitted between your computer and Everest is  transferred securely via the internet, using strong encryption. Everest uses  secure and tested encryption technology bearing certificates provided by  renowned certificate authorities.<br>
  <br>
  <u>Other security measures</u><br>
  <br>
    When users submit sensitive information via the Site, their information is  protected both online and offline. When our registration form asks users to enter  sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is  encrypted and is protected using Secure Socket Layer– (SSL) technology. While  on a secure page, such as our deposit page, the lock icon at the bottom, or in  the url, of your web browser becomes locked. The lock icon is unlocked, or  open, when users are simply 'surfing' and are not inputting sensitive  information. All payments made on our Site are secured in compliance with the  relevant EU rules and regulations.<br>
  <br>
    While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do  everything in our power to protect user information offline. All of our users'  information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted  in our offices. Only authorised Everest employees/contractors are granted  access to personally identifiable information. We perform checks on all of our  potential employees/contractors to ensure that none of them have a criminal  record. Our employees/contractors are regularly made aware of security best  practices within the industry and security audits are carried out on a regular  basis. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are  in a secure environment.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<div><strong>7. Modifications</strong></div>
<br>
<br>
<div>
  <p>It may  become necessary, at any time, for us to make modifications to the Site, to the  House Rules, Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policy governing our services. The  purpose of such modifications may be to further simplify user processes or to  further reinforce security measures in order to upgrade to future technological  innovations. In such cases, customers previously registered on our Site will  keep their user name and password; no modifications will be required on their  part. Continued use of our Site by the members after any modifications to the  Site,  House Rules, Terms and Conditions  or Privacy Policy will be considered as their acceptance thereof. It is the  responsibility of each customer to regularly check the House Rules, Terms and  Conditions and Privacy Policy for updates.</p></div>
