<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>To respond to any social media posts </b>or other public comments you might make, whether they are directed to us or about us, our websites, mobile apps or other activities.</span></li>
<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>For recruitment purposes </b>if you have applied for a position with us including to contact you to discuss a role with us and to assess your suitability. As part of this we may combine any personal data you provide to us with other information we obtain independently from social media sites (e.g. LinkedIn or Facebook).</span></li>
<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>To advertise products or services </b>to<b> </b>you via our email and SMS newsletters.</span></li>
<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>To tell you</b> about any changes to our websites<b> </b>and mobile apps. For example, if we withdraw one of our apps for some reason, or change this privacy policy.</span></li>
<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>To make a contract with you.</b> But also to enforce a contract if you don’t honour it, including the collection of any debts that we may be owed by you.</span></li>
<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>To gather statistics </b>about how you and other people use our website and mobile apps and what you think of our advertisements, special offers, news, websites, mobile apps, competitions, sponsored events, social media and other content. We then analyse all this data to see if what we do is interesting to people and meets their needs, or if they should be improved, and if so, what changes would be most beneficial both for our customers and for us.</span></li>
<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>To monitor </b>how people<b> </b>use our websites and mobile apps to see if they are being abused orthreatened, for example, by internet trolls posting inappropriate comments in review areas or by would-be hackers looking to undermine our security.</span></li>
<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>To protect you </b>and our business from any other potentially criminal behaviour,<b> </b>including identity theft and fraud.</span></li>
<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>To allow us to understand our customer base </b>across all our businesses. We do this by merging your details with information from our other customers and users of our websites and mobile apps. We can then spot trends and common factors among users, plus we can tailor our business approach, our marketing communications, our digital and social media, our websites and mobile apps to the things we believe you and other people like you would be most interested in. This process involves the analysis of many human traits and is sometimes called ‘market segmentation’ or ‘customer segmentation’. Among other things, we look at common trends or ‘segments’ based on people’s geographic location, online behaviours on our websites or mobile apps and the features they look for from our mobile apps.</span></li>
<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>To help us conduct focused market research </b>based on trends and common factors, so we can further improve the mobile apps we offer to all our customers.</span></li>
<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>To test new systems and processes</b> as we roll them out (but generally only in anonymous form) to make sure they work correctly and meet the standards we set for ourselves.</span></li>
<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>To assist us in the development of new products and mobile apps </b>over a period of time. For example, we may need to gauge whether a new product or mobile app is likely to appeal to a large proportion of our customer base. And if not, we’ll want to know why.</span></li>
<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>To see if the money we spend </b>on marketing and advertising across all media represents good value for us or not.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Who do we share with information with?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We will only ever use your personal data for the purposes set out above.&nbsp; However, we can’t run our business or provide our mobile apps without involving other people and organisations from time to time. When we share your information, we want you to know that we only do so in accordance with our legal data protection and privacy obligations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your information may be disclosed to:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Companies, brands and businesses within our group. </b>For example, we’ll share information with Ticket Arena and Event Genius. This is because we hope to have a relationship with you across all our different brands and businesses, if not now, then sometime in the future. And we want to be able to provide you with the same high quality experience whenever and however you deal with us.</span></li>
<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Event organisers </b>to enable them to allow entry to the events, to send marketing communications and other promotional information to you by e-mail, SMS, post, phone, social media</span></li>
<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>With email marketing companies </b>who help us to mail our newsletter to you.<b> </b>Other people who help us provide our websites, mobile apps, and related services to you. They include information technology experts who design and host our websites and mobile apps and general service companies such as email marketing companies.</span></li>
<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Any new business partners </b>we may have over time, for example, in the event of a joint venture, reorganisation, business merger or sale that affects us.</span></li>
<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Our professional advisors</b> including our lawyers and technology consultants when they need it to give us their professional advice.</span></li>

<li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Other people who make a ‘subject access request’</b>, where we are allowed to do so by law. (See ‘Managing Your Information’ below for what we mean by a ‘subject access request’).</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We may also share the information we collect where we are legally obliged to do so, e.g. to comply with a court order.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Social media, blogs, reviews, etc.</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Any social media posts or comments you send to us (on our Facebook page, for instance) will be shared under the terms of the relevant social media platform (e.g. Facebook or Twitter) on which they’re written and could be made public. Other people, not us, control these platforms. We’re not responsible for this kind of sharing. So before you make any such remarks or observations, you should review the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the social media platforms you use. That way, you’ll understand how they will use your information, what information relating to you they will place in the public domain, and how you can stop them from doing so if you’re unhappy about it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s worth remembering too, that any blog, review or other posts or comments you make about us, our products and services on any of our blogs, reviews or user community services will be shared with all other members of that service and the public at large.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You should take extra care to ensure that any comments you make on these services, and on social media in general are fit to be read by the public, and are not offensive, insulting or defamatory. At the end of the day, you are responsible for ensuring that any comments you make comply with any relevant policy on acceptable use of those services.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Mobile app platforms</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our mobile apps run on third party software platforms, for example, Apple’s iOS platform which powers Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android platform which powers Android-based smartphones.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you use any of our mobile apps, your usage of those apps is also subject to the relevant mobile app platform provider’s terms and conditions and privacy policy. You should review their terms and conditions and privacy policy to ensure you understand what information (if any) they will gather about you, how they will use that information, and what you may be able to do if you are unhappy about it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Secruity of your information</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We take the security of your information very seriously.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We use appropriate procedures and technical security measures to safeguard your information across all our computer systems, networks, websites, mobile apps and offices and comply with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office security guidance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>How long do we keep your informartion?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To make sure we meet our legal data protection and privacy obligations, we only hold on to your information for as long as we actually need it for the purposes we acquired it in the first place (those purposes are set out above).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After that we will either delete it or anonymise it so that it cannot be linked back to you.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Managing our marketing communications</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We provide ways for you to stop all email and text (SMS or MMS) communications you receive from us – please see the ‘unsubscribe’ link and ‘STOP’ details we include in each email and text message respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you would like us to change your marketing preferences at any time, you can contact us at support@ticketarena.co.uk.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Managing your information</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To reduce the chances of an error or misunderstanding, we need to keep the information we gather about you is accurate and up-to-date. But whilst we work very hard to make sure mistakes don’t happen, we need your help, too.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Further, if you have reason to believe any of the information we collect on you may be inaccurate, please contact us (see below for how to do this).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You are perfectly within your rights to ask us whether we hold information about you and if so, for us to give you certain details about that information and/or the information itself. This right is commonly known as a ‘subject access request’. Certain exemptions and conditions apply to this right, principally that it should be in writing and that you give us reasonable details about the information you want.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Depending on your country of residence or domicile, you may have additional or different rights to those set out above concerning the information we collect from you and your devices. We will, of course, honour all such legal rights if we are bound by them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We reserve the right to charge you a small administration fee to meet our costs in honouring your legal rights, where permitted by the relevant law.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We also reserve the right not to comply with any enquiries or requests we receive about the information we collect, where we may lawfully do so. For example, if we have reason to believe that a request is malicious, technically impossible, involves disproportionate effort or could be harmful to others.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you have any worries or complaints about the way we use your information, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us. We’ll do our very best to set your mind at rest or put things right. And if, for whatever reason, you feel we’re not meeting the exceptionally high standards we expect of ourselves, you’re within your rights to tell the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) (in the UK)). Please see the section ‘Where to go if you want more information about your privacy rights’ for further details.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And don’t forget that with modern technology you have more and more personal control over what information we and other organisations collect. For example, you can normally reject or delete cookies and tracking technologies sent to your web browser. You can also change related settings to restrict them going forward, such as by using a private browsing mode (although this may affect your browsing experience on some websites). Plus, you can use the settings options in your mobile devices to restrict what sort of information websites and mobile apps are able to access and use about you. Online advertising networks, social media platforms and search engines (Google etc.) also provide tools to manage the data they collect about you, and how it is used and shared. We urge you to look out for these functions and tools and use them to manage your privacy in a way that suits you best.]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Updates to this privacy policy</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We review the ways we use your information regularly. And in doing so, we may change what kind of information we collect, how we store it, who we share it with and how we act on it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Consequently, we will need to change this privacy policy from time to time to keep it accurate and up-to-date.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If following any changes, you continue to use our websites and mobile apps, contact us by telephone or otherwise provide information to us (through social media, for example) we will assume that you agree to those changes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>About us</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our full legal name is Ticket Arena Limited.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We’re a limited company registered in England and Wales and our registered address can be found in the ‘contact us’ section below.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We are the ‘data controller’ of the information you provide us with. This term is a legal phrase used to describe the person or entity that controls the way information is used and processed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We are registered under the Data Protection Act 1998 with the Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK. Our registration number is ZA043317.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Where to go if you want more information about your privacy rights</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) regulates data protection and privacy matters in the UK. They make a lot of information accessible to consumers on their website and they ensure that the registered details of all data controllers such as ourselves are available publicly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You can make a complaint to the ICO at any time about the way we use your information. However, we hope that you would consider raising any issue or complaint you have with us first. Your satisfaction is extremely important to us, and we will always do our very best to solve any problems you may have.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thank you very much for taking the time to read our Privacy Policy.</span></p>
