<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>We built Eventfinder to make it easy to share information with your friends and people around you. We understand you may not want to share personal details; that is why we give you control of your information. Registration requires you to choose a username, home region and email address. Your email address is never displayed to anyone on the site. Your email address may be dislayed in emails if you use Eventfinder to connect with other people, like when sending friend invites. Other personal details will only be displayed if you fill them in - the nature of social networking websites such as Eventfinder means your details will be visible to others - but only the details you choose to supply.</p>
<p>Should you want your details removed completely from Eventfinder there is a simple 'cancel my account' feature in your My Eventfinder settings. Cancelling your account will completely remove your personal details from the Eventfinder database. By using or accessing Eventfinder, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>When you enter Eventfinder, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all Eventfinder visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.

You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.</p>
<p>You post  Content (as defined in the Eventfinder Terms of Service) on the Site at your own risk. Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that  Content you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.

We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Eventfinder stores this information to send this one-time email, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. </p>
<p>We may occasionally use your   email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by Eventfinder that we think you may find valuable.</p>

<h2>  Third Party Advertising</h2>

These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. Eventfinder does not have access to or control  the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on Eventfinder unless you choose to share it with them.</p>
