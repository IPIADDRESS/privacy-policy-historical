<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>We built the Eventfinder Network (which includes the 
 <strong>Eventfinder.co.nz</strong> and <strong>TheHive.co.nz</strong> web 
 sites) to make it easy to share information with your friends and people around
 you. We understand you may not want to share personal details; that is why we 
 give you control of your information. Registration requires you to choose a 
 username, home region and email address. Your email address is never displayed 
 to anyone on the site. Your email address may be dislayed in emails if you use 
 Eventfinder to connect with other people, like when sending friend invites. 
 Other personal details will only be displayed if you fill them in - the nature 
 of social networking websites means your details will be visible to others - 
 but only the details you choose to supply.</p>

<p>Should you want your details removed completely from the Eventfinder Network 
 there is a simple 'cancel my account' feature in your profile settings on any 
 web site in the Eventfinder Network. Cancelling your account will completely 
 remove your personal details from the Eventfinder Network database. By using 
 or accessing Eventfinder.co.nz or TheHive.co.nz, you are accepting the 
 practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

 also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as 
 JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the 
 effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this 
 allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send 
 you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to
