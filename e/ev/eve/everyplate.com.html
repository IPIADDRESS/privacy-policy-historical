Your acceptance of deliveries of the Products after such notice has been delivered to you will constitute your acceptance of such price changes, unless you cancel your subscription to the Service in accordance with these Terms.

REPLACEMENT INGREDIENTS IN MEALS AND PROMOTIONAL INCLUSIONS\n\nGiven the perishable nature of many of our ingredients, and market conditions and product supply beyond our control, we reserve the right to adjust the quantity of any ingredients in a Meal Kit, to discontinue the use of any ingredient or Product, or to substitute any ingredients or entire Meal Kits, all without notice. While we make every effort to ensure that you are provided with the very best ingredients for our Meal Kits, these switches may occasionally be required.

If you purchase any Voucher, Voucher is deemed to have been sold at the time of payment for it. The discount found on the Voucher only lasts for the first week of your subscription plan, unless it specifically states otherwise on the Voucher or when you sign-up. Similarly, a Voucher may only be used once and may not be copied, reproduced, distributed, or published either directly or indirectly in any form or stored in data retrieval systems without our prior written approval. Additionally, Vouchers are only for first-time users of EveryPlate, unless the Voucher states otherwise. EveryPlate reserves the right to withdraw or deactivate any Voucher (other than one which has been purchased) for any reason, at any time. For the avoidance of doubt, and in accordance of the foregoing sentence, EveryPlate reserves the right to withdraw or deactivate any of your outstanding referral credits or similar Vouchers in the event your referral code is posted to a third-party website (excluding your own social media profile(s) or blogs), or if you otherwise violate these Terms. Vouchers may only be redeemed through our Site or App, and not through any other website or method of communication. To use your Voucher, you will be required to enter its unique code at the online checkout and use of such code will be deemed to confirm your agreement to these Terms and any special conditions attached to the Voucher. \n\nPlease note, pursuant to these Terms, at the expiration of the Voucher, you will be billed the standard rate for your Meal Kit on a recurring, weekly basis, unless you cancel your Plan prior to the end of the Voucher period with proper, advance notice to EveryPlate in accordance with these Terms. You may cancel your EveryPlate Subscription up to five (5) days before your first scheduled delivery that does not include the pricing found on the Voucher, pursuant to the Deactivation procedures found in Section 10.3. \n\nAs a part of the verification process, EveryPlate may require a Customer to provide additional identification information. In addition, as a part of the verification process, the Customer authorizes EveryPlate to charge to the Customer’s credit card a $1.00 authorization charge (or such other amount identified to Customer at time of verification by EveryPlate), which amount will be refunded following successful authorization.\n\n### 10. DELIVERY\n#### 10.1\nEveryPlate Delivery Week. EveryPlate’s “Delivery Week” begins on Saturday and runs through the following Friday. The start of our Delivery Week means that new Meal Kits are available to be delivered in your Meal Box. \n\n#### 10.2\nRolling Basis of Meal Selection. You have the option of selecting the day you would like to receive your Meal Box, and, if your specific subscription allows for Meal Kit selection, you also have the option of selecting the specific Meal Kits you would like to receive, on a weekly basis. The day you select to receive your first Meal Box will be the default. In subsequent weeks, if you do not make a change, your Meal Box will arrive on the day you initially selected every week (unless you pause your order, pursuant to these Terms, or there are extenuating circumstances, detailed in these Terms). If you choose to have your delivery on another day for a specific week, that day will become the default, and subsequent weeks will have your Meal Box arriving on the newly selected day. \n\nMeal Kit selection and delivery day selection is on a rolling basis, and all selections “lock” five days prior to the delivery day. For example, if your subscription allows for Meal Kit selection and you receive your Meal Box on Fridays, you will have to make your selection of Meal Kits you want included in your Meal Box on Sunday by 11:59 PM PST. Your credit card or other payment source will then be charged the following day. Similarly, if you want to change the delivery day, you will have to make your selection five days prior to your new delivery day. For example, if you normally receive your Meal Box on Thursdays, but want to receive your Meal Box on a Monday, you will have to make the change five days prior to Monday, which would be the Wednesday of the previous week. \n\nFor further information, please review the chart below:\n\n![download](//images.ctfassets.net/4frik3v39clf/1Qnx5HYkJWYQi0QEEe8SuO/5635b939c09cf00eab57c28d4b550b65/download.png)\n\nPlease note that the specific days in which a Meal Box can be delivered varies by geographic region, and delivery on each day will not be available in all areas. If you have any questions about your area and delivery, please contact Customer Care by phone at (973) 210-4915 or by Live Chat at EveryPlate.com.\n\n#### 10.3\nTo cancel your subscription online, access your Plan Settings page on the Site and select Deactivate Your Plan. You will be responsible for all charges processed prior to the cancellation of your subscription. Payment for your first box is processed immediately upon signing up for your EveryPlate account and cannot be cancelled once processed. Please note that the ability to deactivate any order subsequent to the first box locks five days prior to your scheduled delivery date. Therefore, if you wish to deactivate your account, you must do so before the day and time listed above for your respective delivery date. For example, if you have a scheduled delivery date on Tuesday, you have until Thursday at 11:59 PM PST to cancel your subscription. If you do so after the time listed for your delivery day, payment will be processed, and cancellation will take effect for the following Delivery Week. \n\n#### 10.4\nSkipping your Order. During any production week, Customer has the option to skip their deliveries. In order to do so, log on to your account page on the Site or App, select a particular week (by clicking on the delivery day highlighted) and then click on the “Skip Week” button. You will not be charged for any week in which your order is Skipped. Please note that this action cannot be taken for any scheduled order which has already “Locked,” pursuant to Section 10.2. Additionally, skipping an order shall only apply to the week you skip, and automatic deliveries will commence the following week, unless you choose to skip the following week, subject to the details, above.\n\n#### 10.5\nDelivery Specifics. In the case of weather which inhibits the ability to make safe deliveries, or other events beyond our control that interfere with our ability to deliver your Order, we will attempt to deliver your Order as soon as reasonably possible. In some cases, delivery may occur on a date other than your scheduled delivery day. If the delivery of your Meal Box is not feasible, we will cancel your delivery for the period so affected and issue you a credit, as determined in our sole discretion, or refund of a part or the whole of the purchase price for that Meal Box.\n\n### 11.

As such, you are solely responsible for any preparatory steps, storage of the contents of any Meal Kits, safe washing (we recommend that all fresh produce is washed prior to inclusion in any meal), and the cooking of all the ingredients of the respective Meal Kits. We recommend that you use a thermometer to measure the temperature of any poultry, fish, or meat products that arrive in the insulated portion of the Meal Box, and, pursuant to USDA Guidelines (found here), you should utilize said thermometer to ensure that they are at (or below) 41 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nEveryPlate recommends that all cooking instructions found in the recipe instructions be followed, and all seafood, meats, and poultry should be cooked to the USDA’s recommended internal temperatures (165 degrees Fahrenheit for poultry; 160 degrees Fahrenheit for ground meats;145 degrees for whole meats; and 145 degrees Fahrenheit for seafood). EveryPlate recommends utilizing a food thermometer to verify internal temperatures. For more information, please see the USDA’s website, found here).\n\n### 13.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION \u0026 BINDING ARBITRATION\n\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH EVERYPLATE AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.\n\n#### 24.1\nArbitration Is Binding. YOU AND EVERYPLATE ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO BE UNAVAILABLE OR MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. \n\nANY CLAIM, DISPUTE, OR CONTROVERSY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER PRE-EXISTING, PRESENT, OR FUTURE, AND INCLUDING STATUTORY, CONSUMER PROTECTION, COMMON LAW, INTENTIONAL TORT, INJUNCTIVE, AND EQUITABLE CLAIMS) BETWEEN YOU AND EVERYPLATE ARISING FROM OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR PURCHASE OR USE OF PRODUCTS OR OFFERINGS THROUGH THE SITE AND/OR APP, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION. \n\nThis shall not apply to any disputes arising from Section 18, disputes in which a party seeks to resolve an issue in small claims court, seeks injunctive relief, or other equitable relief related to the use of proprietary rights. \n\n#### 24.2\nPreliminary Resolution Attempts. You agree to notify EveryPlate within forty-five (45) days of the occurrence or alleged occurrence of any dispute that could rise to become a small claim or claim that can be arbitrated according to these Terms. Notification can occur by contacting EveryPlate by phone at (973) 210-4915, by Live Chat on EveryPlate.com or by mailing us at 1025 Post \u0026 Paddock, Grand Prairie, TX 75050. Upon receipt of the notification, both parties shall attempt to resolve the issue within thirty (30) days. If we cannot otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute and you wish to proceed, you must submit your dispute for resolution by arbitration in accordance with these Terms. \n\n#### 24.3\nWaiver of Class Actions \u0026 Class Arbitrations. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to arbitration on an individual basis, and to give up any rights to bring, join, or participate in any class action or representative action with respect to any claim, dispute or controversy that you may have against EveryPlate. In any such dispute, NEITHER PARTIES ARE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER CUSTOMERS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER, OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. Unless both you and EveryPlate agree otherwise, the arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in the suit, and to pay the attorney’s fees and court costs that EveryPlate incurs in seeking such relief. \n\nThis provision preventing you from bringing, joining, or participating in class action lawsuits and class arbitrations: (A) does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights or remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above; and (B) is an independent agreement. The arbitral tribunal has no power to consider the enforceability of this class action and class arbitration waiver and any challenge to the class arbitration waiver may only be raised in a court of competent jurisdiction. You may opt-out of these dispute resolution provisions, pursuant to Section 24.5. \n\nIf any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced.\n\n#### 24.4\nArbitration Proceedings. For claims of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone, or based only on submissions. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude any party from: (i) seeking injunctive relief in order to protect its rights pending an outcome in arbitration; and/or (ii) pursuing the matter in small claims court rather than arbitration. Although we may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we will not seek such an award from you unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous. \n\n#### 24.5\nOpt Out Rights. You may pursue your claim in small-claims court rather than arbitration (as it pertains to Section 24) if you provide written notice of this intention within sixty (60) days of the day you agreed to (or are determined to have agreed to) these Terms. If you choose to opt out, send written notice to: Legal \u0026 Compliance, EveryPlate, 1025 Post \u0026 Paddock, Grand Prairie, TX 75050. Please include your name, contact information, and a clear statement that you would like to opt out of the provisions related to binding arbitration. Please note that, all other provisions of the Terms, including Section 25, will still apply. The Arbitration or smalls-claim court proceeding will be limited solely to your individual dispute.\n\n### 25. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE\n\nAll matters relating to these Terms, your access to and use of the Site/App, and your order, receipt, and use of the Products, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction).

You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.\n\n### 26.
