<font face="arial, helvetica"><b> Snap is TRUSTe Certified </b></font><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">This Overall Privacy Statement verifies that Snap is a member of the TRUSTe Program and is in compliance with the TRUSTe privacy principles.  This
statement discloses the privacy practices for the entire Web Site.
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
<b>About TRUSTe</b><br>

collected; the organization collecting the information; how the information
is used, with whom the information may be shared; what choices are

information; the kind of security procedures that are in place to protect
the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Snap's control; and how
you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1" color="red"><a name="privacy"><b>Snap's Privacy Philosophy</b></a></font>
</p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. Because we gather certain
types of information about Snap users, we want you to understand the terms
and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This
privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and
how to correct or change it.</font>
</p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1" color="red"><a name="info"><b>Information that Snap Gathers </b></a></font>
</p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">Snap gathers two types of information about users:  </font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">

1) Personal data, provided through voluntary registration.<br>
2) Aggregated data, which tracks users as a whole.<br>
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
<b>Personal data</b> may be requested when you sign up for Snap's personalized
services or register for contests, sweepstakes or other promotional
programs offered on our service. We ask for this in order to provide you
with the best Web experience possible.  This information might include
member name, password, age, gender, ZIP code and/or country information. 
Except as described below, it is not disclosed to parties other than Snap
and its parent companies in any way that personally identifies you without
your prior permission.  
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
<b>Aggregated data</b>, which tracks Snap user activity as a whole rather than on
an individual basis, is gathered through several methods.  This tracking
data follows Snap traffic in general, and is not used to identify you
personally.
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
Aggregated tracking information helps us to determine which areas of our
site users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. Snap does
not track what you read, but rather how well each page performs overall.
This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We may disclose
such aggregated information to third parties such as our advertisers and
partners. </font>
</p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1" color="red"><a name="use"><b>How Snap Uses Information</b></a></font>
</p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">Snap uses any personal information that's voluntarily given by you in order
to enhance your experience, whether to provide interactive or personalized
elements on the site or to better prepare future content based on the
interests of our users. Snap also uses information that you voluntarily
provide in order to send electronic updates and to let you participate in
polls and message boards. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
Snap will not disclose any information that personally identifies you to
parties other than Snap and its parent companies without your consent.
There are exceptions: <br>
1) When the purpose and manner of disclosure is clearly defined in advance.<br>
2) When we believe in good faith that disclosure is legally required or to
protect our rights. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">

<b>Contests and Sweepstakes</b><br>
Snap occasionally offers contests and sweepstakes in which we request
certain personal information on a voluntary basis. These contests and
sweepstakes are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and
state laws. The full rules and all information about such contests are
clearly posted during the event, including how information gathered will be
used.
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
<b>Membership Services</b><br>
To use Snap's membership services -- such as e-mail, My Snap and your
personal custom portfolio -- you will be requested to register. During
registration, you'll be asked to supply a member name and password, age,
gender, zip code and/or country information. Snap shares this data with our
service provider(s). For instance, the personal information that you
provide to our e-mail service at Snap is shared with that company in order
to retrieve your password when necessary.
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
 This data is considered highly confidential and is used only to retrieve
your password when necessary. We use high-level encryption when sending
data between Snap and our e-mail provider.
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
<b>Search Terms</b><br>
As a measure of user interest, we track search terms that are entered into
our site. We create aggregrate reports on user demographics and traffic
patterns for advertisers and partners. This allows our advertisers to
advertise more effectively, and allows you to receive advertisements that
are most relevant to you. An advertiser will not receive specific
information that you clicked their ad unless you voluntarily permit us to
do so. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
<b>Cookies and Tracking</b><br>
A cookie is a small data file that Web sites commonly write to your hard
drive when you visit them.  A cookie file contains information that can
identify you anonymously in order to track traffic patterns on our site.
The data is encrypted for your added security.  Snap uses cookies as a way
to measure activity on the site in order to continually improve your
experience. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
Cookies also provide you with a level of convenience -- since they
"remember" your computer, they enable you to enter Snap sites as a member
without having to log on each time, and they allow you to visit
member-restricted areas of the site. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
Cookies don't identify you personally, but rather identify your computer
when you visit our site.  A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or
read cookie files created by other sites.
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
Your browser can be set to warn you before accepting cookies -- in this
case, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You can choose
to refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to
have cookies turned on to use Snap, but you will need them for customizable
areas of the site such as local weather forecasts. Snap does allow users to
clear cookies. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
<b>Electronic Newsletters </b><br>
Snap offers free, electronic newsletters as a service to our users, based
on a voluntary subscription. You will only receive a newsletter if you have
requested it during registration to several areas of Snap or directly from
our signup form. We do not share newsletter mailing lists with any third
parties, including advertisers or partners, unless you voluntarily permit
us to do so when you register or sign up. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
<b>Snap Shops</b><br>
Information you provide about yourself during a purchase through a store
hosted by Snap is automatically provided to the owner of that store. This
includes credit card and personal contact information. Each of these online
merchants carry separate privacy and data collection practices from Snap,
and Snap does not have any responsibility for their practices. For more
information about a policy from a merchant, go to the store's home page and
look for the company profile.
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
<b>Message Boards or Discussion Areas </b><br>	
Please remember that while Snap does not share any personal information
gathered during registration to Snap Message Boards or Discussion Areas,
any postings to message boards or discussion areas become public
information. Use caution when posting.</font>
</p><p>

<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1" color="red"><a name="content"><b>Snap Content Providers, Advertisers and Partners</b></a></font>
</p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">Snap will not provide your personal information to anyone outside of Snap
and its parent companies except in the limited circumstances mentioned, and
only then with your consent. For instance, the personal information you
provide during registration to the Snap Finance center "powered by"
Bloomberg will not be shared with anyone outside of Bloomberg.
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
However, Snap cannot control the practices of other partners and
advertisers. If you have provided personal information to a party or
advertiser connected with Snap and have not been informed by Snap as to its
purpose, contact them directly by going to their home page and looking for
a company profile or information area. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
It is important to note that Snap contains many links to sites other than
Snap, and that those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as
Snap. For instance, if you click an ad or a search result on Snap, this
will take you away from Snap and to an entirely different site. This
includes links from advertisers, content providers and partners who may use
Snap's logo and/or style as part of a co-branding agreement. These sites
may send their own cookies to you, and as a result, may collect data and
ask for personal information that Snap would not. </font>
  </p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1" color="red"><a name="kids"><b>Kids and Privacy</b></a></font>
</p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
Snap requests that children under 17 do not submit or post any information
to the site without a parent's or guardian's consent. However, we will not
request or knowingly collect from a child any information online that can
be traced to the child, such as an e-mail address, name, or information
about the child's family.
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
Unless a parent or guardian consents to such use in advance, Snap will not
knowingly use information that a child provides to Snap for any marketing,
selling or promotional purposes. </font>
</p><p>

<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1" color="red"><a name="changes"><b>Changes to Policy</b></a></font>
</p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">Snap reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying
guests of the existence of a revised privacy policy.</font>
</p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1" color="red"><a name="opt"><b>Opt-Out Policy</b></a></font>
</p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">Snap gives you options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices
include: 
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
1. Opting not to receive our electronic newsletters when registering for a site. <br>
2. Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely
alleviates the need for any information from our users.</font>
</p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1" color="red"><a name="correct"><b>Correct/Update Policy</b></a></font>
</p><p>

<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">Snap offers the ability to correct or change the information collected
during your registration. The instructions for doing this can be found in
our Help area under "Change Member Settings". You may change this
information at any time and as often as necessary. If you're experiencing
problems or have any questions about how our services work, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@snap.com">
support@snap.com</a>.</font>  
</p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1" color="red"><a name="delete"><b>Delete/Deactivate Policy</b></a></font>
</p><p>

<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">You may unsubscribe to our electronic newsletter at any time via e-mail by
following the instructions contained at the end of every newsletter. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
Currently, Snap does not offer a means by which to completely delete
personal information established at the time of registration for any site.
If you have questions about your information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@snap.com">
support@snap.com</a>.</font>
