<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This Policy describes the information that we gather from you on the Service, how we use and disclose such information, and the steps we take to protect such information. &nbsp;By using the Service, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Events.com Terms of Service. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy have the meaning given to them in the Events.com Terms of Service.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What information do we collect on the Service?</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>User-provided Personal Information.</b>&nbsp;When you use the Service, you may provide and we may collect what is often called personally identifiable information which is information that specifically identifies an individual. &nbsp;For the purposes of this Policy, we refer to such information as “<b>Personal Information</b>.” Examples of Personal Information include an individual’s name, email address, mailing address, mobile phone number, and credit card or other billing information. Personal Information may also include other information, such as an individual’s date of birth, geographic area, or preferences, when that information is linked together with Personal Information that identifies a specific individual. You may provide us with Personal Information in various ways on the Service. For example, you provide us with Personal Information when you register for an account, use the Service, make a purchase on the Service, or send us customer service-related requests.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Cookies and Automatically Collected Information</b>. When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to use the Service to its fullest potential.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” This automatically collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users, and may be connected with your Personal Information.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Location Information.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;We may obtain information about your physical location, such as by use of GPS and other geolocation features in your device, or by inference from other information we collect (for example, your IP address indicates the general geographic region from which you are connecting to the Internet).</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons</b>. We may display third-party content on the Service, including third-party advertising. &nbsp;Third-party content may use cookies, web beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by Events.com. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Information from Other Sources</b>. We may obtain information, including Personal Information, from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our customers, partners and advertisers. If we combine or associate information from other sources with Personal Information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information in accordance with this Policy.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Other Third Party Connections</b>:&nbsp;When you use the Service you may connect your account to your accounts on third party services like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Google and/or Linkedin in which case we may collect, use, disclose, transfer and store information relating to your account with such third party services in accordance with this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;For example, if you connect with Instagram, we store your Instagram data which may include your identification, user name, email, profile picture, follower list and location and use them to connect with your Instagram account to provide certain functionality on the Services, like recommending events that your Instagram followers are interested in and sharing the events you are interested in with certain groups of people, like your Instagram followers or the event organizer of the event which you registered.&nbsp;We use services provided by Loginradius to create these connections to your accounts on the third party services mentioned above.&nbsp; As a term of use of the Loginradius services, Events.com has granted Loginradius a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free right to the user content which allows Loginradius to modify, analyze, distribute and use such data in connection with the operation of the service. Loginradius will not sell or share any original user profile data to any third party.</span></p>
