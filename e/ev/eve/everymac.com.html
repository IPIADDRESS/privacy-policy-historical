   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">EveryMac.com, and
   the principal author thereof, believes that your privacy on the
   Internet, and elsewhere, is of great importance. Because
   EveryMac.com gathers information about its users, it is important
   for you, as a user of EveryMac.com, to fully understand the terms
   and conditions regarding the collection and use of that
   information. This privacy policy discloses what information is
   gathered, how it is used, and how you can correct, change, or
   update this information.</font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">This privacy
   policy will answer the following questions:</font></p>
   
   <ul>
      <li><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">What
      personally identifiable information does EveryMac.com
      collect?</font></li>
      
      <li><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">How does
      EveryMac.com use personally identifiable
      information?</font></li>
      
      <li><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">With whom, if
      anyone, does EveryMac.com share this information?</font></li>
      
      <li><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">What options
      are available regarding the collection, use, and distribution
      of this information?</font></li>
      
      <li><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">How does
      EveryMac.com allow one to correct, change, or update this
      information?</font></li>
      
      <li><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">What security
      is in place to minimize the risk of loss, misuse, or alteration
      of this information?</font></li>
   </ul>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif"><br>
   <b>What personally identifiable information does EveryMac.com
   collect?</b></font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">When browsing the
   EveryMac.com website, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your
   computer is collected and stored in a log file. The IP address is
   used to help analyze trends, streamline the performance of the
   webserver, administer the website, and to gather broad statistical
   information for aggregate use. However, IP addresses are not
   linked to any personally identifiable information.</font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">When you register
   as an EveryMac.com member, some personal information is collected.
   During the registration process, EveryMac.com requires you to
   provide your name, e-mail address, how often you visit the site
   and for how long, and if you wish to participate in contests, your
   postal mailing address. Additional demographic information can be
   provided at your option, and it is appreciated, but there is no
   requirement to do so in order to take advantage of the special
   features provided for members. At any point where EveryMac.com
   collects personal information, a link will be provided to this
   privacy policy.</font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif"><b>How does
   EveryMac.com use personally identifiable
   information?</b></font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">EveryMac.com uses
   any information voluntarily provided by members to improve the
   experience of using the website and services provided by
   EveryMac.com, whether to provide personalized or interactive
   portions of the site, or to prepare future content that is of
   greater interest to members. For example, EveryMac.com operates an
   opt-in mailing list (usually sent bimonthly), which is
   personalized for each member.</font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">EveryMac.com uses
   tracking information to determine which portions of the site are
   more popular than others, but what individual members read is not
   tracked. Likewise, when a search is performed with the
   EveryMac.com search engine, the search terms used are recorded,
   but individual search terms are not connected to individual
   members. Both of these tracking methods are helpful to determine
   the relative popularity of individual pages and to improve the
   accuracy of the search engine, which are beneficial to everyone
   who uses the site.</font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">EveryMac.com also
   creates aggregate reports on member demographics and traffic
   patterns for advertisers, sponsors, and business partners. This
   results in advertising campaigns that are more effective for
   advertisers, and advertising that is more relevant for all users
   of EveryMac.com. However, EveryMac.com does not track the usage
   patterns of individual members, and therefore, advertisers,
   sponsors, and business partners will not be able to tell that a
   specific user clicked on a particular advertisement.</font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif"><b>With whom, if
   anyone, does EveryMac.com share this information?</b></font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">EveryMac.com, and
   the principal author thereof, is the sole owner of all information
   collected from the website and services provided by EveryMac.com.
   EveryMac.com will not sell, share, or rent any personally
   identifiable information to any third-parties, except under
   specific circumstances, as described below.</font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif"><b>Contest
   Winners:</b> In the event that you win a prize from EveryMac.com,
   you will be notified of winning, and permission will be requested
   to provide your name, e-mail address, and postal mailing address
   to the sponsoring company, so they can ship your prize to you.
   Obviously, if your postal mailing address is not shared, you will
   not be able to receive your prize, as it has to be shipped to you.
   Nevertheless, you will be given the option of declining your
   prize. If you do not win a prize in an EveryMac.com contest, your
   information will not be shared. However, aggregate member
   demographic information is shared with contest sponsors. For
   example, 32.5% of EveryMac.com members have 16+ years of computer
   experience.</font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif"><b>Legal:</b> In
   the event that you are allegedly involved in any type of criminal
   activity using the EveryMac.com website or services, and
   EveryMac.com is subpoenaed to release your membership information,
   EveryMac.com is required by law to comply with the subpoena.
   EveryMac.com also reserves the right to disclose membership
   information in special cases when releasing the information is
   necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against any
   individual who has blatantly or repeatedly violated the
   </font><a href="termsofuse.html"><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">Terms
   of Use</font></a><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">
   agreement.</font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">EveryMac.com does
   not sell or rent information about individual users to anyone for
   any reason. However, EveryMac.com does share aggregate demographic
   information with advertisers, sponsors, and business partners, but
   this information is not linked to any personal information that
   could identify any individual person. In the unlikely event that
   EveryMac.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired,
   member information will be one of the transferred
   assets.</font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif"><b>What options
   are available regarding the collection, use, and distribution of
   this information?</b></font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">When you signed up
   to become a member of EveryMac.com, you were given the option of
   joining a personalized mailing list, usually sent bimonthly, to
   inform you of site updates. Only EveryMac.com will send you these
   personalized e-mail messages, and only if you indicated that you
   were interested in receiving these messages when you signed up. If
   you are not interested in receiving site update notices, do not
   request them when you sign up, or at any time, you can easily
   leave the list by using the provided instructions.</font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">Companies that
   advertise on EveryMac.com may use cookies to make it easier to
   track banner performance. While EveryMac.com uses cookies to store
   login information, cookies received with advertisements are
   collected by the advertising companies, and EveryMac.com does not
   have any access to this information.</font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">EveryMac.com
   provides advertisers, sponsors, and business partners with
   aggregate information only, in such a manner that neither the
   client nor EveryMac.com can associate any individual or their
   associated membership profile within the aggregate
   information.</font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">Again,
   EveryMac.com does not sell or rent information about individual
   users to anyone for any reason, but in the unlikely event that
   EveryMac.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired,
   member information will be one of the transferred
   assets.</font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif"><b>How does
   EveryMac.com allow one to correct, change, or update this
   information?</b></font></p>
   
   <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, MS Sans Serif">EveryMac.com makes
   it simple to correct, change, or update user information via
