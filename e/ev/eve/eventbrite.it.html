<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
</p><h3>Our Policy:</h3>
Welcome to the web site (the "Site") of Eventbrite, Inc. ("Company", "we", "us" and/or "our"). This Site is operated by Company and has been created to provide information about our company and to provide customized online event management, registration and ticketing services  (the "Company Services") to our Site visitors ("you", "your"). This Privacy Policy sets forth Company's policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data ("Personal Data") and other information that is collected from Site visitors.
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>Information We Collect:</h3>
When you interact with us through the Site, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:
<p></p>
<p>
Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for an event, register for access to the Company Services or use certain Company Services. The Personal data we collect includes without limitation your name, email address and other personally identifiable data.  In addition, if you buy or sell a ticket, we will collect financial information from you (e.g., your credit card number and expiration date, billing address, etc). Wherever Company collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to this Site, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Company and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.
</p>
<p>
</p><h4>Other Information:</h4>
<h5>Non-Identifiable Data:</h5> When you interact with Company through the Site, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Company may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Company affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.
<p></p>
<p>
In operating this Site, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. When you visit the Site, third party advertising networks may also place a cookie on your computer. These cookies may be used to tailor content and advertisements you see on the Site as well as other sites that you may visit in the future.  In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's features.
</p>
<p>
</p><h5>Aggregated Personal Data:</h5> In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Company Services, Company often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Company may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Company may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h3>
Company uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Company Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Related Companies") may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our users and to improve the Company Services. Company and its Related Companies may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. Other uses of your Personal Data include without limitation:  processing payment for purchases you make; delivering tickets, products or services you request; managing your account and providing you with customer service; developing and providing you with promotional or marketing material; protecting against or identifying fraudulent transactions; and generally managing the Company Services and our business.
<p></p>
<p>
If Company intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.
</p>
<p>
</p><h3>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h3>

	<h4>Event Organizers:</h4> "Event Organizers" are registered users who use the Company Services to create, manage, promote and/or sell tickets to an event online.

<p></p>
<p>
