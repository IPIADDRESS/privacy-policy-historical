<b>Privacy @ Eversave.com</b><br>
Eversave.com has created this statement in order to demonstrate our firm 
commitment to privacy. We allow our users to control the amount of personal
 information they provide to us.  Eversave.com hopes that users will feel comfortable 
 providing this information to us, because this information allows us to tailor our 
 Savings Offers to each member's particular interests. However, we recognize 
 that some members will prefer not to provide certain requested information and so 
 we've designed Eversave with the members' personal preferences in mind. 
<br><br>
<b><i>What Information We Collect/How We Use It</i></b>
<br>

<i><u>Contact Information</u></i>. Our registration form requires users to provide
e-mail address, zip code, gender, and date of birth in order to register for the
Eversave.com service. Users may provide additional information, such as categories
of interest, preferred stores, and demographic information.  The additional information
is not required to become a member, but many members choose to supply the
information so that they receive offers that match their shopping
interests and store preferences.  Eversave.com uses the information in
four ways: 1. At the member's request, we send e-mails with targeted
advertising, promotions and coupons based on user's interests; 2. We
contact users for feedback and surveys; 3. We send users other
information about Eversave; and 4. Date of birth is required
to verify that the user is qualified to participate in the Eversave service.
</p><p>
Other than consumers, Eversave collects personally identifiable information from 
prospective affiliates in order to identify potential business partners. Eversave not 
only collects the aforementioned contact information but it also collects more specific 
information about the company such as the company's URL and how many people view
it per month. More importantly, Eversave collects sensitive information on this page such 
as the company's Tax ID number or the individual's Social Security Number for payment purposes. 

</p><p>
Eversave.com will present members with offers via email and a personalized web page 
on behalf of leading retailers and service providers. Except as otherwise stated, 
Eversave.com will not knowingly share your individual information with third parties 
without your authorization or consent. 
</p><p>
<i><u>Profile Data</u></i>. We use profile data collected through the registration process 
described above, and through voluntary actions of registered users of the Eversave service, 
consisting of demographic information and shopping preferences to provide members
with a personalized home page and tailored e-mails. This information allows us to provide
users with specific content based on indicated interests and preferences. This information 
is not required in order to receive the Eversave service. Users may provide as much or 
as little information as they choose. However, the omission of certain information may limit 
the value of the Eversave experience for the member. 
</p><p>
Eversave acts as a consolidator of savings offers on behalf of retailers and service 
providers. Geographic, demographic, and category preference information across 
member profiles may be summarized for merchants advertising on Eversave. 
This helps prospective sponsors understand the viewership they will reach. 
Aggregate information includes percent membership by Age range and Gender, 
and Category preference. Please refer to the following section "Reports" 
for more information. 
</p><p>
<i><u>Public Display of Personal Information.</u></i> Eversave.com includes a collection of personal stories, ideas, tips, etc. 
written by our members to be posted on our website. At the bottom of these pages is an email address that can be used to send your 
own stories to be published on our website. Please note that by sending a story to this email address, you are authorizing us to post 
your story on our website. If you include any personally identifiable information in this story such as your name or hometown, this 
information may be posted on the website as well.
</p><p>
<i><u>Surveys &amp; Contests</u></i>. Both during the registration process and from time-to-time thereafter our service requests 
information from users via contests and surveys, including asking new members to complete 
a survey containing profile information regarding their specific interests.  Participation in these 
surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not 
to disclose this information.  Information requested typically includes contact information 
(such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level).  
Information requested in surveys or polls may be related to shopping behavior and/or other
interests of the member.  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  
Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction 
of our service.  The survey information may also be used to determine which offers will be 
served to a particular member.
</p><p>
Some of the surveys and contests relate to offers and promotions presented
by our clients who sponsor the offers.  In order to participate in the
sponsor offer we provide you with the opportunity to share some of your
contact information directly with the clients who subject the information
you provide to their own information practices and privacy policies.  We
will provide you with notice of such instances where the information will
be shared with third parties, and you will decide whether to submit any
form.  The choice of participation in any promotion or offer remains yours.
</p><p>
<i><u>Reports</u></i>. We provide reports to a limited number of companies with which we do business. 
These reports include aggregate information about our users. The information in these reports will 
not identify individual members. No information is contained in the reports that would allow outside 
companies to contact members directly.
</p><p>
<i><u>Referral Program</u></i>. Participants in the referral program, provide us with contact information 
(like the name and e-mail address) for friends and family whom they refer.  By providing such information, 
the referring participant certifies that they have received permission from the referred person to 
disclose such contact information and that the referred person has given their permission to receive 
email communications from Eversave.  We treat referral information with the same confidentiality as member information. 
Eversave.com sends the referred person a one-time e-mail. The person referred to us only becomes enrolled 
if they choose to respond to the e-mail and enter their information. They can also follow the unsubscribe directions at the bottom 
of the email or in the section titled "Deactivate or Change Your Status" in this privacy statement.
</p><p>
<b><i>Other Web Sites and Your Privacy</i></b>
<br>
Eversave.com contains links to other Web sites, and those Web sites
may be presented in a framed or co-branded format.  Once you select a
link that takes you to another Web site, you are subject to the privacy
policy of the Web site containing that page.  Please note that these
other Web sites may have privacy policies that differ from those of Eversave
in the level of security, use of cookies and use of personally identifiable
information.  We have no control over any information you choose to provide
those Web sites.
</p><p>
<b><i>Changes in Privacy Practice</i></b>
<br>
In the event of any fundamental amendment to the privacy statement for Eversave.com, 
both the new and the old privacy statements will be posted for a period of 30 days on this Privacy Policy page. 
Users will be notified by email 30 days in advance of the Privacy statement change. 
A link to the new statement will also be displayed on the site. After 30 days, only the new privacy statement will appear. 
During the 30 day period, users may change their status with Eversave.com as described in the "Changing Your Status" 
section of the Privacy Statement or as described in any notice. After 30 days, the new privacy policy will be in 
effect regarding the usage and treatment of information. 
</p><p>

<b><i>Log Files</i></b>
<br>
Log files are generated on all web sites on the Internet, including Eversave.com. 
These files are set according to the standards for HTTPD web server technology 
as described by the standards organization, W3C (WorldWideWeb Consortium). 
These Log files contain 'clickstream information' (i.e. transactions about the web pages viewed during a session, 
including the originating web site/web page, navigation to another web site/web page, 
the type of browser used, date/time, and success status of the server transaction). 
</p><p>
Links between pages are described using a URL (Universal Resource Locator) address, 
<a href="http://www.eversave.com">http://www.eversave.com</a>. 
Each page viewed has a unique address that is recorded as a transaction in the server log. 
Transactions about all pages viewed on Eversave.com are analyzed to administer 
the web site and to count visits to a page. An individual's session activity in the logs is 
associated with an account for the purpose of generating relevant savings offers. 
Finally, web site design uses log transactions to optimize site navigation.
