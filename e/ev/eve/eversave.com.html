<b>Privacy @ Eversave.com</b><br>
Eversave.com has created this statement in order to demonstrate our
firm commitment to privacy. We allow our users to control the amount
of personal information they provide to us and how we use that
information. Eversave.com hopes that users will feel comfortable
providing this information to us, because this information allows us
to tailor our Savings Offers to each member's particular
interests. However, we recognize that some members will prefer not to
provide certain requested information and so we've designed Eversave
with the members' personal preferences in mind.
<br><br>
<b><i>What Information We Collect/How We Use It</i></b><br>
<i>Contact Information</i>. Our registration form requests users to
provide contact information (e.g., name, e-mail address, and zip
code). Some information is required in order to receive the Eversave
service and other information is optional. The required information is
clearly marked on the registration pages. We use the information in
three ways: 1. At the member's request, we send e-mails with targeted
advertising, promotions and coupons based on user's interests; 2. We
contact users for feedback and surveys; and 3. We send users other
information about Eversave.
</p><p>
Eversave.com will present members with offers via email
and a personalized web page on behalf of leading retailers
and service providers. Eversave.com will not share any of
your individual information with third parties unless you
have specifically requested for Eversave.com to share your
information with select companies.
</p><p>
<i>Profile Data</i>. We use profile data to provide members with a
personalized home page and tailored e-mails. This information allows
us to provide users with specific content based on indicated interests
and preferences. This information is not required in order to receive
the Eversave service.  Users may provide as much or as little
information as they choose. However, the omission of certain
information may limit the value of the Eversave experience for the
member.
</p><p>
Eversave acts as a consolidator of savings offers on behalf of
retailers and service providers.  Geographic, demographic, and
category preference information across member profiles may be
summarized for merchants advertising on Eversave. This helps
prospective sponsors understand the viewership they will
reach. Aggregate information includes percent membership by Age range
and Gender, and Category preference. Please refer to the following
section "Reports" for more information.
</p><p>
<i>Reports</i>. We provide reports to a limited number of companies
with which we do business.  These reports include aggregate
information about our users. The information in these reports will not
identify individual members. No information is contained in the
reports that would allow outside companies to contact members
directly.
</p><p>
<i>Referral Program</i>. Participants in the referral program, provide
us with contact information (like the name and e-mail address) for
friends and family whom they refer. We treat referral information with
the same confidentiality as member information. Eversave.com sends the
referred person an e-mail. The person referred to us only becomes
enrolled if they choose to respond to the e-mail and enter their
information.
</p><p>
<i>Membership Card Data</i>. Eversave.com may receive data about
member purchases from merchants that accept the Eversave Membership
Card. This information is used to provide additional offers in which
members may be interested.
</p><p>
<i>Links</i>. This site contains links to other sites. Eversave.com is
not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web
sites. If you have a question about the privacy policy of those web
sites, please visit them directly.
</p><p>
<i>Contests/New Member Promotions</i>. Eversave runs contests and new
member promotions on our site.  We ask these participants for postal
contact information(e.g. name and mailing address) so that we may
deliver awards or incentives. The Referral Program described above
also requires that a member provide their name and mailing address so
that referral redemptions may be delivered.
</p><p>
Members will only receive email correspondence to indicate membership,
contest, or promotion status, or to communicate merchant savings as
part of our service. It is not our practice to otherwise communicate
by postal mail unless email contact cannot be established.
</p><p>
<b><i>Changes in Privacy Practice</i></b>
<br>
In the event of any fundamental amendment to the privacy statement for
Eversave.com, both the new and the old privacy statements will be
posted for a period of 30 days on this Privacy Policy page.  Users
will be notified by email 30 days in advance of the Privacy statement
change. A link to the new statement will also be displayed on the
site. After 30 days, only the new privacy statement will
appear. During the 30 day period, users may change their status with
Eversave.com as described in the "Changing Your Status" section of the
Privacy Statement or as described in any notice. After 30 days, the
new privacy policy will be in effect regarding the usage and treatment
of information.
</p><p>
<b><i>Cookies</i></b>
<br>
We use cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it
each time you visit our site.  Cookies are a standard internet
technology that allow us to store and retrieve the login information
on your system. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine
the identity of any of our users.  You may choose not to have your
password stored during the registration process (you will need to
enter your password each time you want to access your personalized
Eversave Web page).
</p><p>
Cookies are also used on Eversave.com so that the web pages presented
to you are consistent. Based on this implementation of session
management, you must have cookies enabled to use our site.
</p><p>
Finally, when a user comes to Eversave.com from certain other web
sites, a cookie may be placed by a third party ad server that helps
Eversave.com understand how new members come to our site.. The third
party ad server places similar cookies on other web sites so that it
understands your interests across web sites.
</p><p>
Although cookies must be enabled to access Eversave.com, this specific
third-party cookie does not have to be present in your 'Cookies'
folder to access our site. If you wish to eliminate cookies placed by
this third party server, you must delete them from the 'Cookies'
folder in the 'Windows' folder of Microsoft Windows systems. If you
are not able to determine which cookies are being set by this server,
you may choose to delete all cookies. However, this action will
eliminate any control information that has been set-up by other web
sites you visit. In the case of Eversave.com, the next time you visit
<a href="http://www.eversave.com">http://www.eversave.com</a>, a new
cookie will be placed to guide your session interaction.
</p><p>
<b><i>Log Files</i></b>
<br>
Log files are generated on all web sites on the Internet, including
Eversave.com. These files are set according to the standards for HTTPD
web server technology as described by the standards organization, W3C
(WorldWideWeb Consortium). These Log files contain 'clickstream
information' (i.e. transactions about the web pages viewed during a
session, including the originating web site/web page, navigation to
another web site/web page, the type of browser used, date/time, and
success status of the server transaction).
</p><p>
Links between pages are described using a URL (Universal Resource
Locator) address, e.g.<a href="http://www.eversave.com">http://www.eversave.com</a>. Each page
viewed has a unique address that is recorded as a transaction in the
server log. Transactions about all pages viewed on Eversave.com are
analyzed to administer the web site and to count visits to a page. An
individual's session activity in the logs is associated with an
account for the purpose of generating relevant savings offers.
Finally, web site design uses log transactions to optimize site
navigation.
</p><p>
<b><i>Security</i></b>
<br>
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse
or alteration of the information under our control. Eversave uses
networking, server, database, and procedural mechanisms to safeguard
the integrity and privacy of data.
</p><p>
<b><i>Changing Your Status</i></b>
<br>
If you would like to change any of your profile information, login to
Eversave, and click on the "Update Preferences" button, and follow the
directions. This will automatically change the information contained
in our database.
</p><p>
Because we want our users to feel completely comfortable using the
Eversave services, you have the option of not receiving e-mails as
part of our service.
</p><p>
Finally, you may answer 'no' to "I would like to receive e-mails with
savings offers" on your personal profile page and you will no longer
receive e-mails as part of our service. Alternatively, send an e-mail
to <a href="mailto:Unsubscribe@mail1.eversave.com">
Unsubscribe@mail1.eversave.com</a>.

privacy statement, the practices of Eversave.com, or your dealings
