We will automatically send your friend a one-time email with the gift you bought for him/her or inviting your friend to visit the Site. The Site stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, sending the gift, and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us via <a href="http://www.eversave.com/contact-request.jsp?cc=1">this link</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

<p>In addition, we may receive other information about you from the merchants in our network with whom you visit or transact. They may provide information such as purchase transaction(s), items ordered, order number and date and time of purchase, which is linked to your Personal Information. In addition, we may maintain this information in an anonymous, aggregate manner for purposes of enhancing users' experience on the Site or to determine which merchant sites are most frequently visited by our users. We handle Personal Information and all such other information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>If you send an e-mail to us or fill out our "Feedback" form through Eversave.com, we will collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files, and other information you provide.</p>
 
<p><b><i>Surveys</i></b></p>

<p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on the Site. If you participate, we will request certain information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is voluntary. The requested information typically includes certain Personal Information (such as name, email and/or mailing address). We may use this information to publish contest winners, to monitor Site traffic or personalize the Site, and/or to send participants an email newsletter. We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; however, that company will be prohibited from using your Personal Information for any other purpose.</p>

<p><b><i>Refer-a-Friend</i></b></p>

<p>We may offer a referral service (called Refer-A-Friend) that will allow you to potentially earn rewards if you provide the Service with specific Personal Information (generally name and email address) of your friends and other contacts and they register and use the Site. The Service will then forward certain marketing communications and/or emails to those individuals and monitor if they utilize the Service or Site. We will not use these invitee email addresses for any other purpose.</p>

<p><b><i>Cookies and Logfiles</i></b></p>

<p>Like many websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.

After collection, during our processing of the data, we link this automatically-collected data to the Personal Information that we hold.</p>

You understand that when you use Eversave.com, certain information you post or provide through Eversave.com, such as your name, profile, comments, testimonials, and reviews, may be shared with other users and posted on publicly available portions of Eversave.com, including without limitation, social media applications and other public forums in which you choose to participate. Please keep in mind that if you choose to disclose Personal Information when posting comments or other information or content through Eversave.com, this information may become publicly available and may be collected and used by others, including people outside the Eversave.com. We will not have any obligations with respect to any information that you post to parts of Eversave.com available to others, and recommend that you use caution when giving out personal information to others through social media networks or otherwise.<p></p>

</p><p>5. Links to Third Party Sites</p>

<p>Our Site may contain links or references to third party websites, and the privacy policies of these sites may differ from our own. Please be aware that we have no control over such third party websites. Our privacy policy does not apply to such websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all such third party websites.</p>

<p>6. How We Protect the Security of Personal Information</p>

<p>The security of your Personal Information is an important concern to us.</p>

<p>We take appropriate security measures that comply with Federal law to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized access to or loss, misuse, disclosure, alteration or destruction. We implement generally accepted standards of technology security, including firewalls, to protect your Personal Information. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.
Unfortunately, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, and no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee that any information stored on our servers, or transmitted to or from a user, will be free from unauthorized access and you agree not to hold us responsible for any breach of security. In addition, unencrypted e-mail is not a "secure" means of communicating with us, since e-mail may be intercepted by a third party in the course of its delivery.</p>

<p>7. Transfer of Personal Information Outside of Your Country of Residency</p><p>

</p><p>You acknowledge that we may need to host or store data outside of the United States. By providing any Personal Information to the Site, you consent to the hosting and storage of such information outside of the United States.</p>

<p>Although we cannot guarantee the same level of protection for your Personal Information as may be afforded in the United States, and despite the risks entailed with on-line communications, we take every reasonable precaution to protect your Personal Information.</p>

<p>8. Children's Privacy</p><p>

</p><p>Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. Our service is not available to anyone under 18 years of age. We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people whom we know are under 18 years of age.</p>

<p>9. California Privacy Rights</p>

<p>Under California law, California residents have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have entered an established business relationship, (1) a list of the categories of personal information, such as name, address, e-mail address, and the type of services provided to the customer, that a business has disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, and (2) the names and addresses of all such third parties. To request the above information, please e-mail us via <a href="http://www.eversave.com/contact-request.jsp?cc=1">this link</a> or write to us at Eversave Customer Service, 40 Harvard Mills Square, Suite 1, Wakefield, MA 01880.</p>

<p>We will respond to such written requests within 30 days following receipt at the e-mail or mailing address stated above. If we receive your request at a different e-mail or mailing address, we will respond within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed 150 days from the date received. Please note that we are only required to respond to each customer once per calendar year.</p>

<p>10. How to Update your Personal Information</p>

<p>You have the right to request a copy of the Personal Information that we hold about you. If you would like a copy of your Personal Information, or to have such Personal Information deleted from our records, please contact us via

<a href="http://www.eversave.com/contact-request.jsp?cc=1">this link</a>. We want to make sure that your information is accurate and up-to-date.

<p>We reserve the right to amend or modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently on the Site. If we make any changes, we will either notify you by email or post a notice on the Site's homepage. We will also summarize any material changes to the Privacy Policy on the Site. We encourage you to read any revised Privacy Policy. 
<br><br>
Your continued use of our Site following the notification of, or posting of, changes to this Privacy Policy means you accept these changes.</p>

<p>13. Your Acceptance of this Privacy Policy</p>
