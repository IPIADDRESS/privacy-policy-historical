<p>EverFi, Inc. of Washington D.C.
(“EverFi” “we” or “us” or “our”) is committed to providing an informative and
engaging educational technology platform for all of its users.&nbsp; EverFi feels
strongly about protecting the privacy of its users.&nbsp; EverFi owns or operates
the websites listed at the following link:  <a id="show_div" href="#" onclick="javascript:popup('theList');">Website List</a>. 
These websites and the services available
thereon and other services we may make available from time to time (together
with associated and successor websites and services) are referred to as the
“Service”.&nbsp; This General Privacy Policy informs you of the policies of EverFi,
regarding information that we collect from users of our Service.&nbsp; This General
Privacy Policy applies only to information that we collect.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>BY USING THE SERVICE OR PROVIDING ANOTHER
PERSON WITH ACCESS TO USE THE SERVICE, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS
GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY, YOU
SHOULD NOT USE THE SERVICE OR PROVIDE ANOTHER PERSON WITH ACCESS TO USE THE
SERVICE. CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICE FOLLOWING THE POSTING OF CHANGES TO THIS
GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY MEANS THAT YOU ACCEPT THOSE CHANGES.</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>1). How We Collect and Use Information:</strong>
</p>

<p>In addition to the specific uses described
below, EverFi generally uses the information collected through the Service to
provide the Service to users, to help us understand who uses the Service, for
internal operations such as to improve the Service, and to contact users for
customer service and billing purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;We may use a Service user’s information to
send a welcoming email that may confirm the user’s user name and password. &nbsp;Without
requiring the user to “opt-in”, we may send the user electronic newsletters and
marketing materials, contact the user about products, services, information and
news that may be of interest to the user, and provide the user with targeted
feedback.&nbsp; In addition, if a user identifies himself or herself to us by
sending us an email with questions or comments, we may use the user’s
information (including personally identifiable information) to respond to the
user’s questions or comments, and we may file such questions or comments for
future reference. &nbsp;We may also use the information collected to send important
service announcements and updates regarding the Service or, if applicable,
about billing account status. You will not be able to unsubscribe from these
service announcements and updates as they contain important information
relevant to the use of the Service.</p>

<p>We may also use the information gathered through
the Service to perform statistical analysis of user behavior or to evaluate and
improve the Service.&nbsp; We may link some of this information to personally
identifiable information for internal purposes or to improve users’ experience
with the Service.&nbsp; All information collected may be used or shared by EverFi as
described in this General Privacy Policy on a worldwide basis.</p>

<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>
</p>

<p>Personally identifiable information is
information that identifies a Service user or can be used to identify or
contact a Service user. Such information may include a Service user’s name,
address, email address, and telephone number.&nbsp; EverFi may collect personally
identifiable information during the registration process from a user or from a user’s
Entity (as defined below).&nbsp; This information allows EverFi (and the schools,
organizations, and teachers who use our products) to track the use of our educational
technology platform and Service.&nbsp; Although not a requirement, we may also collect
and use email addresses to help with customer support calls and to allow users
access to self-service functions such as password reset features, etc. </p>

<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>
</p>

<p>Non-personally identifiable information is
information, any single item of which, by itself, cannot be used to identify or
contact a Service user, such as demographic information (like age, profession,
current location, zip code, or gender). Non-personally identifiable information
may also include user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, user name,
test results, test scores, survey data, and statistical data involving the use
of the Service.&nbsp; We collect non-personally identifiable information during the
registration process and also through the use of cookies and log files, as described
in this General Privacy Policy.&nbsp; One type of non-personally identifiable
information that we collect is aggregate information regarding overall
server/visitor traffic and navigation patterns for the Service, which is
collected for basic system monitoring.&nbsp; Web servers collect this type of basic
information automatically as part of Web log processes.&nbsp; This tracking helps us improve the design and content of
our Service.&nbsp; As further described below, we also collect aggregate information
concerning the demographics and progress of our users.</p>

<p><strong>Surveys</strong>
</p>

<p>EverFi collects
data from surveys, including demographic information to help us evaluate the
effectiveness of our courses.&nbsp; EverFi will extract all individual pieces of
personally identifiable information (such as name, e-mail address, and, if
appropriate, login ID) from any survey data before sharing such data with a
user’s Entity (as defined below) or any other third party.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Contests and Advisory Boards</strong>
</p>

<p>Through the Service, users who are over the age
of 18 have the option to enter contests or to participate in advisory panels.&nbsp;
Such users may be required to enter additional information, such as an email
address.&nbsp; This participation is completely optional; users are not required to
participate in such activities in order to use the Service.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong>
</p>

<p>As a standard practice, EverFi uses
“cookies”.&nbsp; EverFi may use cookies on its Service to ensure the integrity of
the registration process and to personalize course content. &nbsp;A cookie is a small
text file that is placed on a user’s hard disk by a Web page server.&nbsp; Cookies
are uniquely assigned to a user and can only be read by a Web server in the
domain that issued the cookie. Only session cookies are used, which means that
the cookie will only exist on a computer while a user is on the Service. If a
user logs out or closes his or her browser window, he or she will delete the
cookie. No information persists. &nbsp;Please note that if you refuse the EverFi
cookie (by turning cookies off in your browser or by clicking “don’t accept” if
you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies), the offerings,
features, and resources of the Service will not work.&nbsp; In order to use the
Service, a user may need to decrease the security or privacy settings of his or
her browser to accept cookies.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Collection of IP Addresses</strong>
</p>

<p>As with many sites, an IP address is visible to
us when users visit our Service.&nbsp; An IP address is a number automatically
assigned to an individual’s computer whenever he or she is connected to the
Internet.&nbsp; EverFi will only use IP addresses when users sign up for the Service
to help diagnose problems with our server.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong><em>Note regarding credit card information:</em>
</strong> For users who register and take our e-commerce online
course through the http://www.outsidetheclassroom.com website, credit card
information and payments are collected and processed by a third-party site
managed by Verisign. We do not collect or store any credit card information on
our servers.</p>

<p><strong>2). SHARING OF INFORMATION WITH THIRD
PARTIES:&nbsp; </strong>
</p>

<p><strong><em>Service Users’ Entities </em>
</strong>
</p>

<p>We may share all information about a user’s
use of and performance on the Service with the school and school district
and/or other organization (an “Entity”) that provides the user with access to
use the Service, including the Entity’s representatives, such as teachers and
administrators.&nbsp; Such information will be provided, via a password protected
administrative portal, and may include, but will not be limited to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Course
progress/completion</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><strong><em>Teachers and Administrators</em>
</strong>
</p>

<p>As noted above, we may share all information about
a user’s use of and performance on the Service with the teachers,
administrators, and other representatives of the Entity that provides the user with
access to use the Service.&nbsp; Such information will be provided, via a password
protected administrative portal, and may include, but will not be limited to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Course

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Additional
aggregate data the Entity or Entity’s representative request</p>

<p><strong><em>Third-Party Sponsors</em>
</strong>
</p>

<p>EverFi works with third-party sponsors to
bring our courses to some Entities free-of-charge.&nbsp; We only share
non-personally identifiable user information with our sponsors. &nbsp;We, however, may aggregate the information that we collect
from users of our Service to create demographic profiles and performance
profiles regarding the progress of users who use the Service. This aggregated
information may be shared with third parties in the form of group statistics.</p>

<p><strong><em>Laws and Legal Rights</em>
</strong>
</p>

<p>We may disclose a Service user’s information
(including personally identifiable information) if we believe in good faith
that we are required to do so in order to comply with an applicable statute,
regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory
order, or other valid legal process. We may disclose personally identifiable
information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that
disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal
action against someone who may be violating the <strong><a href="terms.asp">Terms of Use</a> </strong>for our Service, to detect
fraud, for assistance with a delinquent account, or to protect the safety
and/or security of our users, the Service or the general public.</p>

<p><strong><em>Third Parties Generally</em>
</strong>
</p>

<p>We may provide to third parties
non-personally identifiable information about Service users, including where
such information is combined with similar information of other users of the Service.
For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users
who visit the Service, the demographic breakdown of our registered users of the
Service, and the test results and progress of users.&nbsp; The third parties to
which we may provide non-personally identifiable information may include
affiliates, actual or potential commercial partners, students, customers,
sponsors, Entities of Service users, licensees, researchers and other similar
parties.</p>

<p><strong><em>Outside Contractors</em>
</strong>
</p>

<p>We may employ independent contractors,
vendors and suppliers (collectively, "Outside Contractors") to
provide specific services related to the Service, such as hosting and
maintaining the Service, providing credit card processing and fraud screening,
and developing applications for the Service and e-mail services. In the course
of providing services to us, these Outside Contractors may sometimes have
limited access to information collected through the Service, including users’
personally identifiable information. </p>

<p><strong><em>Sale of Business</em>
</strong>
</p>

<p>We reserve the right to transfer information (including
personally identifiable information) to a third party in the event of a sale,
merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of EverFi or
any of its Affiliates, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the
terms of this General Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong><em>Affiliates</em>
</strong>
</p>

<p>We may disclose information (including
personally identifiable information) about Service users to our Affiliates. For
purposes of this General Privacy Policy, "Affiliate" means any person
or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under
common control with EverFi, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information
relating to Service users that we provide to our Affiliates will be treated by
those Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this General Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>3). Other Websites:&nbsp; </strong>
</p>

<p>Our Service may contain links to
other websites not owned or operated by EverFi. However, please be aware that
we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites. We encourage
you to be aware when the Service links to other websites and to read the
privacy policies or statements of each and every website. This General Privacy
Policy applies solely to information collected through the Service.</p>

<p><strong>4). Protecting Your Information:</strong>
</p>

<p>EverFi has multiple security measures in
place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our
control.&nbsp; However, no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to
be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.&nbsp; We believe that
we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
procedures to help safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain
data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.</p>

<p><strong>5). Our Commitment to Children’s
Privacy:</strong>
</p>

<p>EverFi is committed to protecting
the privacy of children.&nbsp; Please see our <a href="coppa1.asp">COPPA Privacy Policy</a> for our guidelines concerning
the collection of information from children under the age of 13.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>6). Amendments:</strong>&nbsp; </p>

<p>EverFi may amend this Privacy
Policy from time to time.&nbsp; We encourage you to check this page periodically for
any changes.&nbsp; Your continued use of the Service following the posting of
changes to this General Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of those changes.&nbsp;
