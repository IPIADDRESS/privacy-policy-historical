<h3>Our Policy:</h3>
<p>
Welcome to the www.Eventbrite.com website (including all webpages, subdomains and subparts therein contained, the "Site") of Eventbrite, Inc. ("Company", "we", "us" and/or "our"). The Site has been created (i) to provide information about Company, (ii) to provide customized online event management, registration and ticketing services (the "Company Services"), and (iii) to provide information about events listed on the Site.
</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy sets forth Company's policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable information ("Personal Data"), that is collected from Site users and visitors (including through those users' and visitors' agents) ("you" or "your"), including (i) registered users who are event organizers and planners ("Organizers"), (ii) registered users who want to purchase tickets to, register for or donate to events (whether free or paid) listed by Organizers on the Site ("Buyers"), and (iii) other non-Organizer users or visitors to the Site ("other non-Organizers").
</p>
<p>
Company takes the privacy of your Personal Data and other information seriously. Because of that, Company has created this Privacy Policy. Please read this Privacy Policy as it includes important information regarding your Personal Data and other information.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us by using the following link: <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/contact-us" target="_blank">http://www.eventbrite.com/contact-us/</a>.
</p>


<h4 class="uppercase">Consent:</h4>
<p>
<strong>
By using the Site or allowing someone to use the Site on your behalf, you are consenting to our collection, use, disclosure, transfer and storage in accordance with this Privacy Policy of any Personal Data or other information received by Company as a result of such use.
</strong>
</p>


<h3>Information We Collect:</h3>
<p>
When you interact with us through the Site, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:
</p>

<h4>1. Personal Data:</h4>

<p>
<span>Organizers:</span>
We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information on the Site, such as when you register for access to the Company Services as an Organizer, contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys or use certain Company Services. The Personal Data we collect includes without limitation your name, email address and other personally identifiable information. In addition, if you use our payment processing services, we will collect financial information from you (e.g., your bank account information) as necessary to facilitate payments.
</p>

<p>
<span>Buyers and other non-Organizers:</span>
We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information on the Site (including event registration pages within the Site), such as when you register for access to the Company Services (whether as an Organizer or otherwise), register for an event as a Buyer, contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys or use certain Company Services. The Personal Data we collect includes without limitation your name, email address and other personally identifiable information. If you register for a paid event, we will collect financial information from you (e.g., your credit card number and expiration date, billing address, etc) some of which may constitute Personal Data. In addition, Organizers can set up event registration pages to collect virtually any information from Buyers in connection with registration for an Organizer's event listed on the Site. If a Buyer voluntarily provides that information in connection with registration for an event, it will be available to Company and will be held by Company in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In addition, such information will be delivered to the Organizer of the applicable event in accordance with "Our Disclosure of Information That We Collect: Organizers" below.
</p>

<p>
<span>Privacy Policy Links:</span>
We make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy in the footer of every page on the Site, including those pages on which Personal Data is collected.
</p>


<h4>2. Non-Personal Data:</h4>
<p>
<span>Non-Identifiable Data:</span>
When you interact with the Site, we collect certain personally non-identifiable information ("Non-Personal Data"). The Non-Personal Data we collect includes without limitation Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, domain names of your Internet Service Provider, your approximate geographic location, a record of the Site pages that you visit, the time of your visits and aggregated Personal Data that cannot be used to specifically identify you. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot, in and of itself, be used to specifically identify you.
</p>

<p>
<span>Cookies:</span>
In operating the Site, we use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. These cookies may be used to tailor content you see on the Site as well as other sites that you may visit in the future. Through your web browser's option settings you may be able (i) to receive notifications when you are receiving new cookies, (ii) to disable cookies or (iii) to delete cookies. Please refer to your web browser's help section for information on how to do this. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's features.
</p>

<p>
<span>Aggregated Personal Data:</span>
In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Site and Company Services, Company often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on Personal Data and other information that we have collected. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis and this aggregate information does not identify you personally and therefore is considered and treated as Non-Personal Data under this Privacy Policy.
</p>



<h3>Our Use of Information That We Collect:</h3>
<h4>1. Personal Data:</h4>
<p>
Company uses the Personal Data we collect in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. Company may use the Personal Data as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <span>Specific Reason:</span> If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem and will respond to the email address from which the contact came.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>Access and Use:</span> If you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to or use of the Site or Company Services or any functionality thereof, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to or use of such services or functionality and to monitor your use of such services or functionality.

    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
        <span>Organizer Emails:</span> We allow Organizers to use our email system to contact Buyers for their current and past events, so you may receive emails from our system that originate with such Organizers.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
If Company intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.
</p>


<h4>2. Non-Personal Data:</h4>
<p>
Because Non-Personal Data cannot be used to personally identify you, Company may use such information for any lawful purpose.
</p>


<h3>Our Disclosure of Information That We Collect:</h3>
<h4>1. Personal Data:</h4>
<p>
Company is not in the business of selling your Personal Data. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. Therefore, Company will not sell your Personal Data to third parties, including third party advertisers. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may disclose, transfer or share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
</p>
<p>
<span>Business Transfers:</span>
As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.
Subsidiaries and Affiliates: We may also share your Personal Data with our subsidiaries and/or affiliates for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. Our subsidiaries and affiliates will be bound to maintain that Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
<span>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</span>
Company, like many businesses, sometimes engages other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, ticket fulfillment, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we engage another company to perform such functions, we may provide them with information, including Personal Data, in connection with their performance of such functions.
</p>

<p>
<span>Organizers:</span>
When you purchase tickets to, register for or donate to an event on our Site, you consent to our providing your Personal Data to the Organizers of such event. These Organizers are not bound to treat your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You agree that Company is not responsible for the actions of these Organizers with respect to your Personal Data. It is important that you review the applicable policies of the Organizers of an event before providing Personal Data or other information in connection with that event.
</p>
<p>
<span>Legal Requirements:</span>
Company may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law (including, without limitation responding to a subpoena or request from law enforcement, court or government agency) or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary (i) to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) to protect and defend the rights or property of Company, (iii) to act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) to protect against legal liability.
</p>


<h4>2. Non-Personal Data:</h4>
<p>
Because Non-Personal Data cannot be used to personally identify you, Company may disclose, transfer or share Non-Personal Data for any lawful purpose.
</p>


<h3>Your Choices:</h3>
<p>
You have several choices available when it comes to your Personal Data:
</p>
<p>
<span>Limit the Personal Data You Provide:</span>
You can use the Site without providing any Personal Data or with limiting the Personal Data you provide. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data or limit the Personal Data you provide, you may not be able to use certain Site functionality and/or Company Services. For instance, in order to open an Eventbrite account, or buy or sell tickets, your name and email address will be required.
</p>
<p>
<span>Opt Out:</span>
You can "opt out" of receiving Company newsletter emails by logging in, clicking on "Account" and following the instructions to "email preferences." You may modify your choices at any time in your Company account. In the event an Organizer uses our system to email you, you will be able to "opt out" of receiving those communications as well. Please note that if you unsubscribe from receiving a particular Organizer's emails, you will no longer receive emails from the particular Organizer that are sent through our system (but you may still receive emails sent by that Organizer through means other than our system), however, you will still receive Company communications and communications from other Organizers whose events you have attended or are registered to attend or who have otherwise obtained your email address. Likewise, if you unsubscribe from Company communications you will continue to receive communications from Organizers. So you may have to unsubscribe from multiple emails before you stop receiving all communications. You can also unsubscribe from receiving all Organizer emails sent through our system. It may take up to 24 hours for us to process an unsubscribe request. Note that you cannot unsubscribe from Company Service communications via the Site. You can stop receiving Company Service communications only by contacting us at <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/contact-us" target="_blank">http://www.eventbrite.com/contact-us/</a> and closing your account. By electing to stop receiving all communications from Company or through Company's system you will no longer receive any updates on your account or on events you are registered to attend or have previously attended, including communications regarding refunds. We do not recommend that you do this unless you plan to no longer use the Site or Company Services, are not currently registered for an event, are not currently organizing an event and will have no need to receive further communications from Company or through Company's system. Even after you opt out of all communications, Company will retain your Personal Data and Non-Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, however, we will no longer use it to contact you.  However, Organizers who have received your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy may still use that Personal Data to contact you in accordance with their own privacy policies, but they may not use Company's system to do so.
</p>

<p>
