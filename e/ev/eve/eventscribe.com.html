    De-Identified Personal Information data (i.e., data that cannot be

    <li>
        <strong>Web Beacons.</strong>
        Pages of our Website and our emails may contain small electronic
        files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs. pixel tags
        and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who
        have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related

        <strong>Pixel Tracking</strong>
        <strong>.</strong>
        In addition to using Cookies, the Website may employ “pixel tracking”,
        a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements on
        other sites. Pixel tracking involves the use of pixel tags that are not
        visible to the user and consist of a few lines of computer code. Pixel
        tracking measures the effectiveness of advertisements and compiles
        aggregate and specific usage statistics. A “pixel tag” is an invisible
        tag placed on certain pages of websites that is used to track an
        individual user’s activity. We may access these pixel tags to identify
        activity and interests that may allow us to better match our goods,
        services, and other offers with your interests and needs. For example,
        if you visit our Website from an advertisement on another website, the
        pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track that its advertisement
        brought you to the Website. If you visit our Website, and we link you
        to another website, we may also be able to determine that you were sent
        to and/or transacted with a third-party website. This data is collected
        for use in our marketing and research.

</p>
<p>
    We may also use your Personal Information to contact you about our own and
    third-parties’ goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you do
    not want us to use your information in this way, please check the
    relevant box located on the form on which we collect your data.
</p>
<p>
    We may use your Personal Information you provide to us and which we obtain
    from other sources to better understand your interests so we can try to
    predict what other products, services and information you might be most
    interested in. This practice is called “profiling”, which involves making
    automated decisions about you based on this information in order to better
    enable us to tailor our interactions with you to make them more relevant
    and interesting. You may object to such profiling at any time by contacting
    us (see Contact Information/User Rights below).
</p>
<p>
    We may use the information we have collected from you to enable us to
    display advertisements to our advertisers’ target audiences. Even though we
    do not disclose your Personal Information for these purposes without your
    consent, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the
    advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria.
</p>

    <h2>Social Media Plugins</h2>

<p>
    We integrate social media application program interfaces or plug-ins
    (Plug-ins) from social networks, including Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn,
    Xing, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest and/or possibly other
    companies, into the Website. In order to register as a user with us, you
    may have the option to sign in using your Facebook or other social media
    site (SMS) login.
</p>
<p>
    For example, when you visit our Website or platform, the plugin creates a
    direct connection between your browser and the Facebook server. This allows
    Facebook to receive information about your visit to our Website or platform
    with your IP address. If you click the Facebook “Like” button while you are
    logged on to your Facebook account, you can link the contents of our
    Website or platform to your Facebook profile. This allows Facebook to
    assign your visit to our Website or platform to your user account. Please
    note that as provider of the Website or platform, we receive no
    notification about the contents of the transmitted data or their use by
    Facebook. If you do not want Facebook to assign your visit to our Website
    or platform to your Facebook user account, please log out of your Facebook
    user account.
</p>
<p>
    If you do so, you authorize us to access certain SMS account information,
    such as your public SMS profile (consistent with your privacy settings in
    SMS), your email address, interests, likes, gender, birthday, education
    history, relationship interests, current city, photos, personal
    description, friend list, and information about and photos of your SMS
    friends who might be common SMS friends with other users. Plug-ins may
    transfer information about you to the Plug-in’s respective platform without
    action by you. This information may include your platform user
    identification number, which website you are on, and more. Interacting with
    a Plug-in will transmit information directly to that Plug-in’s social
    network and that information may be visible by others on that platform.
    Plug-ins are controlled by the respective platform’s privacy policy, and
    not by our Privacy Policy. You can find the privacy policy for a platform
    on their website.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Retention of Your Information </strong>
    Following termination or deactivation of your account, we may retain your
    profile information and all information posted to public areas of the
    Service. Following termination or deactivation of your account, we may
    retain your Personal Information and other data, but will maintain it as
    confidential according to the Terms, this Privacy Policy and as required by
    applicable law. We have the right to delete all of your Personal
    Information and other data after termination of your account without notice
    to you.
</p>

    <h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>

<p>
    <em>Personal Information:</em>
</p>
<p>
  We will never rent or sell your Personal Information to third parties, other than as noted below under the section “Disclosure/Assignment of Your Personal Information”. We may share your Personal Information with third parties for the purpose of providing or improving the Services to you.  If we do this, such third parties’ use of your Personal Information will be bound by obligations of confidentiality.

<p>
    <u>Events</u>
    . From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events
    or activities (“<strong>Events</strong>”) on the Service together with a
    third party partner. If you provide information to such third parties, you
    give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other
    use to which you consent. We cannot control third parties’ use of your
    information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or
    shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these
    Events.
</p>
<p>
    Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose
    Personal Information to any third party unless required to do so by law,
    court order, legal process, or subpoena, including to respond to any
    government or regulatory request, or if we believe that such action is
    necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us
    or our affiliates or partners, or investigate, prevent, or take action
    regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms
    (including for billing and collection purposes), take precautions against
    liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party
    claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to

    protect the rights, property, or personal safety of us, our users or
    others.

    Website, it is anticipated that your Personal Data will be disclosed to the
    following categories of third-party service providers who perform functions

</p>

        <h2>Disclosure/Assignment of Your Personal Information: Your Consent</h2>

<p>
    You consent to our disclosure of your Personal Information and other
    information to a potential buyer or other successor for the purpose of
    considering a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization,
    dissolution, or sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a

    assignment, conveyance, or transfer (whether by contract, merger or
    operation of law) of rights to your Personal Information and other
    information, with or without notice to you and without your further
    consent.
</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>

<p>
    We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information
    from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and
    disclosure.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
	<li>
    Your Personal Information is contained behind secured networks and a
    firewall and is only accessible by a limited number of persons and service
    providers who have special access rights to such systems, and are required
    to keep the information confidential.
    </li>
    <li>
    In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and currently is processed by    <a href="http://braintree.com/">Braintree</a> (though we may change
    processors at any time and without notice).
    </li>
    <li>
    Any payment transactions will be performed using our third party payment
    processors or gateways, who will use appropriate security procedures
    designed to protect your information.
    </li>
    <li>
    Our Website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known
    vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our Website safer.
    </li>
    <li>
    We may store, retrieve, access, and transmit your Personal Information in
    the US or in other countries.
	</li>
</ul>
<p></p>	
<p>
    The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we
    have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain
    parts of the Website or Services, you are responsible for keeping this
    password confidential. You should not share your password with anyone. You
    must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information
    by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access
    to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have
    finished accessing your account. The information you share in public areas
    may be viewed by other users. We’ll never email you to ask for your
    password or other account information. If you receive such an email, please
    send it to us so we can investigate.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not
    completely secure. Although we do use security measures designed to protect
    your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your
    Personal Information transmitted to us or which we obtain. Any transmission
    of Personal Information is at your own risk. Unauthorized entry or use,
    hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the
    security of user information at any time. We are not responsible for
    circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the
    Website or used with our Services.
</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>

<p>
    The time periods for which we retain your Personal Information depend on
    the purposes for which we use it. We will keep your Personal Information
    for as long as your account is active, or as long as you are a registered
    user of our services or for as long as we have another business purpose to
    do so and, thereafter, for no longer than is required or permitted by law,
    or our records retention policy, reasonably necessary for internal
    reporting and reconciliation purposes, or to provide you with feedback or
    information you might request. This period of retention is subject to our
    review and alteration. The information we collect may be stored and
    processed in servers in the United States and wherever we and our service
    providers have facilities around the globe.
</p>

    <h2>What You Can Access</h2>

    Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or

    name and password

    <li>
    other user profile information, including any content you have uploaded
    to the Services

    information we have on file about you, please contact us.
</p>

    <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act (“CalOPPA”)</h2>

<p>
    Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents
    are entitled to ask us annually for a notice identifying the categories of
    Personal Information which we share with our affiliates and/or third
    parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such
    affiliates and/or third parties.
</p>
<p>
    CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites
    and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches
    well beyond California to require any person or company in the United
    States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting
    Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a
    conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information
    being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being
    shared. - See more at:
    <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">
        http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    As required by CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
</p>
<p>
    You can visit our Website anonymously by enabling private browsing through
    your browser. We have a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the
    first significant page after entering our Website. Our Privacy Policy link
    includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page specified
    above.
</p>
<p>
    You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy
    Website page. You can change your Personal Information by contacting us.
</p>
<p>
    We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use
    advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
</p>

    <h2>Notices; Opting Out</h2>

<p>
    By providing us with your email address (including by “following,”
    “liking,” linking your account to our Service or other services, etc., on a
    third party website or network), you consent to our using the email address
    to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law,
    in lieu of communication by postal mail. You also agree that we may send
    you notifications of activity on the Service to the email address you give
    us, in accordance with any applicable privacy settings. We may use your
    email address to send you other messages or content, such as, but not
    limited to, newsletters, additions or changes to features of the Service,
    or special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you
    may opt out by emailing us your request. Opting out may prevent you from
    receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, special features,
    announcements, or offers. You may not opt out of Service-related emails.
</p>
<p>
    You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above.
    When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the
    unrevised information in our records. You may request deletion of your
    account by emailing us.

    <h2>Additional Information for Non-US Residents</h2>

<p>
    IMPORTANT NOTICE: This Privacy Policy originates and is hosted on a Website
    located in the United States, which has different data protection laws from
    those of other nations, and particularly member nations in the European
    Union. Due to differing laws and legal practice, be aware that law
    enforcement agencies in the United States may have access to your Personal
    Information.
</p>
<p>
    If you are located in the EEA or other regions with laws governing data
    collection and use that may differ from the laws in the United States,
    please note that we may transfer your information to a country or
    jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your
    jurisdiction. It may also be processing your information by staff operating
    outside the EEA who works for us or for one of service providers. If
    required by applicable law, we will seek your explicit consent to process
    your Personal Information collected on our Website or volunteered by you.
</p>
    <strong><u>GDPR</u></strong>
<p>
    The following provisions apply to you if you are a European citizen or
    resident. All processing of your Personal Information is performed in
    accordance with privacy rights and regulations following the EU Directive
    95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995
    (the “Directive”), and the implementations of the Directive in local
    legislation. As of May 25, 2018, the Directive and local legislation based
    on the Directive will be replaced by the Regulations (EU) 2016/679 of the
    European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection
    of natural persons with regard to the processing of Personal Information
    and on the free movement of such data, known as the General Data Protection
    Regulation (GDPR), and our processing will take place in accordance with
    the GDPR. For purposes of the GDPR, we will be the “data controller” of
    Personal Information (referred to in the GDPR as “personal data”) we
    collect through the Website, unless we collect such information on behalf
    of a “data controller” in which case we will be a “data processor.” This
    Privacy Policy does not apply to websites, applications or services that do
    not display or link to this Privacy Policy or that display or link to a
    different privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
    This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are
    concerned with how their ‘Personally Identifiable Information’ (PII) is
    being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law, Directive 95/94C
    (“The EU Directive”) and its replacement the General Data Protection
    Regulation (“GDPR”), is information that can be used on its own or with
    other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to
    identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully
    to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise
    handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our
    website.

    <strong>Data Transfers<a name="data_transfers"></a></strong>
<p>
    We are headquartered in the United States. As such, we and our service
    providers may transfer your Personal Information to, or access it in,
    jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as
    your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your Personal
    Information receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions
    in which we process it. If you are located in the European Economic Area
    (“EEA”) or Switzerland, we provide adequate protection for the transfer of
    Personal Information to countries outside of the EEA or Switzerland through
    a series of intercompany agreements based on the Standard Contractual
    Clauses. We may also need to transfer your information to other group
    companies or service providers in countries outside the EEA. This may
    happen if our servers or suppliers and service providers are based outside
    the EEA, or if you use our services and products while visiting countries
    outside this area.
</p>
<p>
    If you are a resident of country other than the United States, you
    acknowledge and consent to our collecting, transmitting, and storing your
