<p>Where you have expressly provided consent online when asked to do so, we may also use Your Personal Information to communicate information to You about our products and services and to improve our understanding of the needs of potential and existing users of our services.</p>
<h3>3. Collection, use &amp; retention of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We collect, use and retain Personal Information about you only to the extent that is reasonably required to conduct our business effectively.</p>
<p>The information collected by Us varies depending on the service you request from us.</p>

Your credit/debit card details are only used to process the transaction You have requested, and are NOT stored or used in any other way by Us.</p>
<p>We may also collect Personal Information directly from You when You speak to Us over the telephone or send Us correspondence or submit an accommodation review or a review of Our services.</p>

The Personal Information we collect may also be accessed by staff outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, including our affiliated subsidiary in Tunisia.</p>
<p>The Personal Information we collect may also be shared with third parties where this is necessary to process and complete Bookings or payment transactions on Your behalf, to fulfil Our contractual obligation to You, or allow the relevant third parties to fulfil their obligations to You in providing the service You requested. Such third parties may be located outside the EEA and may store the data we share with them outside the EEA. Third parties may include without limitations:-</p>
<p>An accommodation provider that You selected via the Booking Service, a third party operating the website which made the Booking Service available to You (for example: an online travel website, or regional and local tourism organisations), or a payment processor (for the processing of card payments) (“Booking Partners”).<br>
one of our contracted suppliers (for example: the data centre hosting our services, or a market research company handling surveys on our behalf). (“Suppliers”).</p>
<p>Booking Partners and Suppliers operating under a contractual agreement with Us are either bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy or required to comply with current applicable data protection regulations.</p>

<p>If You are an accommodation provider or business partner concerned with the protection of Your Personal Information, We recommend that you use a distinct separate business email, business address, business phone line and business bank account rather than use Your personal data.</p>
<p>Should You, as an accommodation provider or business partner, choose to provide Personal Information to Us in response to a specific request for business contact details (for example a business email, address, and phone number), You understand and agree that any Personal Information provided in this context shall be deemed to be Your business contact data, and Your consent to its use as business information, and that this data will NOT be protected by the provisions of this Privacy Policy and GDPR. You understand and agree that when you provide business contact data and business Content to Us, You give us the right to use and publish said business Content and contact data via the internet, via email, and/or share it or publish it via Our travel distribution partners.</p>

<p>We are compliant with the Payment Card Industry security standard (PCI-DSS Level 1). We are audited annually by an independent expert and the card schemes, including a full review of our systems and procedures, and the relevant penetration tests, to ensure that we provide the highest level of card payment security.

<p>Your Personal Information will also be processed by Our Merchant Bank Ingenico Financial Solutions SA/NV, for the sole purpose of being able to process your card payment where applicable. The processing of Your card payment includes fraud monitoring and fraud management and other checks related to the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Ingenico’s privacy policy is available at https://www.ingenico.com/epayments/legal/account-holder</p>
<p>We may in addition from time to time share non-personal, non-individual information in aggregate form with third parties for business purposes, for example we may tell our Booking Partners including regional tourism agencies and commercial distributors the number of customers or level of bookings in certain demographic groups. The sharing of aggregate data does not involve the disclosure of Personal Information which can identify any particular individual.</p>
<p>Third parties may publish or use Your Personal Information if you have expressly provided this Personal Information to Us as your business contact information, as part of the Content You supply when advertising Your accommodation on certain travel sites, to ensure that third parties and potential guests are able to contact You.</p>

<h3>7. Share facility</h3>
<p>If you use any social media share facility on our Website and give us details of another person (e.g. their name and email address), you should make sure that the other person is content to share their personal information with Us and receive information from Us. We will only use their data for the purpose of sharing information via email or social media.</p>

<p>Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of Your device when You register or fill-out a Form or subscribe and cookies enable Our server to recognize who You are each time You return. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.</p>
<p>Our Website uses cookies to store certain information and this includes both session and persistent cookies, and We may automatically use cookies to collect non-personal information about You, such as the type of internet browser You use, the website from which You have come to Our Website. Cookies also allow us to collect Your IP address (the unique address which identifies Your computer on the internet and classifies as Personal Information) which is automatically recognised by Our web server.</p>
<p>This information is only used to assist Us in providing an effective service on the Website and to collect broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may make limited use of cookies to deliver content specific to Your interests, retain Your personal preferences or hold session information in order to improve the Website’s usability, analyse how Our Website is being used, administer the Website, prevent fraud and improve the security of the Website, or personalise the Website for each user. We use Google Analytics to analyse cookies.</p>
<p>We ask You to consent to our use of cookies in accordance with the terms of this policy when you first visit Our Website. By using Our Website and agreeing to use cookies when asked to do so, You consent to Our use of cookies in accordance with the terms of this policy.</p>
<p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on Our behalf.

Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If You would like more information about this practice and Your choices, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative website (//www.networkadvertising.org).</p>
<p>You can erase or block cookies from Your device if You want to (Your device manual or Help information for Your browser should tell You how to do this). If You block or delete cookies, you may not be able to use all the features of Our Website or you may find the Website less usable.</p>

You also have the right to withdraw any consent previously given to Us with regard to the collection and processing of Your Personal Information.</p>
<p>To the extent that We have a legal obligation to hold Your Personal Information – for example the requirement to hold invoice information for up to seven (7) years and the requirement to provide guest registration information to the local health &amp; safety or police authorities – the minimum information required, including Personal Information, shall be held until the legal requirement expires and this minimum required Information shall be passed to the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we are able to disclose any Personal Information to You.</p>
