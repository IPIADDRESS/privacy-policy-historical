	<h1 class="western">Privacy Policy</h1>
	<h2 class="western">1. Introduction</h2>
	<p>Evilshare.com ("us","we", or "Company") is committed to respecting the 
	privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of the Company 
	Website ("the Site"). This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Site, 
	and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, 
	each of which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and 
	policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<h2 class="western">2. Information Collection Practices</h2>
	<h3 class="western">2.1. TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>
	<h4 class="western">(a) TRAFFIC DATA COLLECTED.</h4>
	<p>We automatically track and collect the following categories of 
	information when you visit our Site: (1) IP addresses; (2) domain servers; 
	(3) types of computers accessing the Site; and (4) types of web browsers 
	used to access the Site (collectively "Traffic Data"). Traffic Data is 
	anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful 
	for marketing purposes or for improving your experience on the Site. We also 
	use "cookies" to customize content specific to your interests, to ensure 
	that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, and to store your 
	password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site.</p>
	<h4 class="western">(b) PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED.</h4>
	<p>In order for you to access certain premiums, services and to purchase 
	products that we offer via the Site, we require you to provide us with 
	certain information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). 
	Personal Information includes the following categories of information: (1) 
	Contact Data (such as your name, mailing address, and e-mail address); (2) 
	Financial Data (such as your account or credit card number); and (3) 
	Demographic Data (such as your zip code, age, and income). If you 
	communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, 
	bulletin boards, or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys, or 
	contest entries, any information provided in such communication may be 
	collected as Personal Information.</p>
	<h3 class="western">2.2. USES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>
	<h4 class="western">(a) COMPANY USE OF INFORMATION.</h4>
	<p>We use Contact Data to send you information about our company or our 
	products or services, or promotional material from some of our partners, or 
	to contact you when necessary. We use your Financial Data to verify your 
	qualifications for certain products or services and to bill you for products 
	and services. We use your Demographic Data to customize and tailor your 
	experience on the Site, displaying content that we think you might be 
	interested in and according to your preferences.</p>
	<h4 class="western">(b) SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</h4>
	<p>We share certain categories of information we collect from you in the 
	ways described in this Privacy Policy. We share Demographic Data with 
	advertisers and other third parties only on an aggregate (i.e., 
	non-personally-identifiable) basis. We will never share your personal 
	Contact Data with third parties, except that we share Contact Data and 
	Financial Data with our business partners who assist us by performing core 
	services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and 
	security) related to our operation of the Site. Those business partners have 
	all agreed to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that 
	we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy (to include the 
	implementation and maintenance of reasonable security procedures to protect 
	sensitive data), and they will only use your Contact Data and other Personal 
	Information to carry out their specific business obligations to Company. If 
	you do not want us to share your Contact Data with any third parties, please 
	email us at webmaster@evilshare.com or select the "opt out" box on our 
	online forms, but please understand that such a request will likely limit 
	your ability to take advantage of all of the features and services we offer 
	on the Site. In addition, we maintain a procedure for you to review and 
	request changes to your Personal Information; this procedure is described in 
	Section 3.1, below.</p>
	<h4 class="western">(c) USER CHOICE REGARDING COLLECTION, USE, AND 
	DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</h4>
	<p>You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. In such 
	an event, you can still access and use much of the Site; however you will 
	not be able to access and use those portions of the Site that require your 
	Personal Information. If you do not wish to receive information and 
	promotional material from us or from some of our partners, you may select 
	the appropriate "opt-out" option each time we ask you for Personal 
	Information.</p>
	<h2 class="western">3. CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
	<p>Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your 
	Personal Information private and will not share it with third parties, 
	unless such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with a court order or 
	other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) enforce our 
	Terms of Service. Your Personal Information is stored on secure servers that 
	are not accessible by third parties. We provide you with the capability to 
	transmit you Personal Information via secured and encrypted channels if you 
	use a similarly equipped web browser.</p>
	<h3 class="western">3.1. USER ABILITY TO ACCESS, UPDATE, AND CORRECT 
	PERSONAL INFORMATION.</h3>
	<p>We maintain a procedure in order to help you confirm that your Personal 
	Information remains correct and up-to-date. At any time, you may visit your 
	personal profile at http://www.evilshare.com by logging into the Site and 
	accessing your personal profile. Through your personal profile you may: (a) 
	review and update you Personal Information that we have already collected; 
	(b) choose whether or not you wish us to send you information about our 
	company, or promotional material from some of our partners; and/or (c) 
	choose whether or not you wish for us to share your Personal Information 
	with third parties.</p>
	<h3 class="western">3.2. LOST OR STOLEN INFORMATION.</h3>
	<p>You must promptly notify us if your credit card, user name, or password 
	is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will 
	remove that credit card number, user name, or password from your account and 
	update our records accordingly.</p>
	<h3 class="western">3.3. PUBLIC INFORMATION.</h3>
	<p>The Site contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the 
	privacy practices or the content of such websites. We also make chat rooms, 
	forums, message boards, and news groups available to you. Please understand 
	that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public 
	information. We have no control over its use and you should exercise caution 
	when deciding to disclose your Personal Information.</p>
	<h2 class="western">4. UPDATES AND CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
	<p>We reserve the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, change, 
	update, or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting such change, 
	update, or modification on the Site and without any other notice to you. Any 
	such change, update, or modification will be effective immediately upon 
	posting on the Site.</p>
