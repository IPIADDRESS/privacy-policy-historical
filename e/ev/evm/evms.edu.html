            the different categories of uses and disclosures as well as some 
            examples of each category. Not every use or disclosure in a category 
            will be listed.</font><ol>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>For treatment.</b> We may 
              disclose your medical information to physicians, nurses, medical 
              students, and other health care personnel who provide you with 
              health care services or are involved in your care. For example, if 
              you are being treated for a knee injury, we may disclose your 
              medical information to a physical rehabilitation department in 
              order to coordinate your care.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>For payment.</b> We may use 
              and disclose your medical information in order to bill and collect 
              payment for the treatment and services provided to you. For 
              example, we may provide portions of your medical information to 
              our billing department and your health plan to get paid for health 
              care services we provided to you. We may also provide your medical 
              information to our business associates, such as billing companies, 
              claims processing companies, and others that process our health 
              care claims.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>For health care operations.</b> 
              We may disclose your medical information in order to operate the 
              Health Services practice plan. For example, we may use your 
              medical information in order to evaluate the quality of health 
              care services, to evaluate the performance of the health care 
              professionals, and for the teaching and training of health care 
              personnel. We may also provide your medical information to our 
              accountants, attorneys, consultants, and others in order to make 
              sure we're complying with the laws that affect us.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>When a disclosure is required</b> 
              by federal, state or local law, judicial or administrative 
              proceedings, or law enforcement. For example, we make disclosures 
              when a law requires that we report information to specific 
              government agencies and law enforcement personnel about victims of 
              abuse, neglect, or domestic violence; when dealing with gunshot 
              and other wounds; or when ordered in a judicial or administrative 
              proceeding.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>For public health activities.</b> 
              For example, we report information about births, deaths and 
              various diseases to government officials in charge of collecting 
              that information. We provide coroners, medical examiners, and 
              funeral directors necessary information relating to an 
              individual's death. We are also required to report any situations 
              where we cannot eliminate the possibility of child abuse or elder 
              abuse.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>For health oversight 
              activities.</b> For example, we will provide information to assist 
              the government when it conducts an investigation or inspection of 
              a health care provider or organization.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>For purposes of organ 
              donation.</b> We may notify organ procurement organizations to 
              assist them in organ, eye, or tissue donation and transplants.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>For specific government 
              functions.</b> We may disclose your medical information to 
              military personnel in certain situations. We may also disclose 
              medical information for national security purposes, such as 
              conducting intelligence operations.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>For worker's compensation 
              purposes.</b> We may provide your medical information in order to 
              comply with worker's compensation laws.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>To avoid harm.</b> We may 
              provide your medical information to law enforcement or persons 
              able to prevent or lessen harm in order to avoid serious threat to 
              the health or safety of a person or the public.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Appointment reminders and 
              health-related benefits or services.</b> We may use your medical 
              information to provide appointment reminders or give you 
              information about treatment alternatives, or other heath care 
              services or benefits we offer.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>For research.</b> Under 
              certain circumstances, we may use and disclose medical information 
              about you for research purposes. For example, a research project 
              may involve comparing the health and recovery of all patients who 
              receive one type of medication to those who receive another 
              medication, for the same condition. All research projects are 
              subject to a special approval process. This approval process 
              entails trying to balance the research needs with the patient's 
              need for privacy of their medical information. We may disclose 
              medical information about you to people preparing to conduct a 
              research project, for example, to help them look for patients with 
              specific medical needs, so long as the medical information they 
              review does not leave Eastern Virginia Medical School facilities. 
              We will almost always ask for your specific permission if the 
              researcher will have access to your name, address or other 
              information that reveals who you are, or will be involved in your 
              care at Eastern Virginia Medical School.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Fundraising activities.</b> 
              We may use your medical information to raise funds for our 
              organization. The money raised through these activities is used to 
              expand and support the health care services and educational 
              programs we offer the community. We only would release contact 
              information, such as your name, address and phone number and dates 
              you received treatment or services at Eastern Virginia Medical 
              School. If you do not want us to contact you for fundraising 
              efforts, you must notify our Privacy Office in writing.<br>

              Usually, this includes medical and billing records, but does not 
              include psychotherapy notes.<br>
              <br>
              If you want to request a copy of your medical information, you must submit 
              your request in writing to the site where medical service or 
              treatment was provided. We may charge a fee for the cost of 
              copying, mailing or other supplies associated with your request. 
              If we don't have your medical information but we know who does, we 
              will tell you how to get it. We will respond to you in 15 days 
              after receiving your written request for a copy. We will respond 
              to you in 30 days if you want to inspect your medical record.<br>
              <br>
              In certain situations, we may deny your request to inspect and 
              receive a copy your medical information. If we deny your request, 
              we will tell in you in writing our reasons for the denial and 
              explain your right to have the denial reviewed.<br>

              You have the right to get a list of instances in which we have 
              disclosed your medical information. This list will not include 
              uses or disclosures made for treatment, payment, or health care

              corrections or law enforcement personnel or those released as a 
              result of your written authorization.<br>
              <br>
              We will respond within 60 days of receiving your request. Your 
              request must state a time period which may not be longer than six 
              years and may not include dates before April 14, 2003. The list 
              will include the date of the disclosure, to whom the medical 
              information was disclosed, a description of the information 
              disclosed and the reason for the disclosure. The first list you 
              request within a twelve month period will be free. For additional 
              lists, we may charge you for the costs of providing the list. We 
              will notify you of the cost involved and you may choose to 
              withdraw or modify your request at that time before any costs are 
              incurred.<br>
