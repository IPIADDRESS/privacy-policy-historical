	<h1 class="t-center">EvoMarketplace, Inc, Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p>Last updated: June 13, 2018.</p>

	<p>
		EvoLeads outlines important information in this Privacy Policy
		regarding the use and disclosure of information collected via <a href="http://www.evoleads.com" target="_blank">www.evoleads.com</a>.<br>
		EvoLeads provides this Privacy Policy to help users make an informed
		decision as to whether to use or continue using this website. EvoLeads
		is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices
		of third web sites or applications.
	</p>

	<p>We also comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR").</p>

	<p>This Privacy Policy applies to EvoLead’s collection, use, storage
		and disclosure of information by EvoLeads on its (a) websites,
		including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies
		(collectively, the Website), (b) on various third party websites, and
		(c) to EvoLead’s other information collection, including the
		purchase of customer lists from third parties.</p>

	<p>Note: EvoLeads has the right to change this privacy policy at
		anytime. It is the user's responsibility to check back regularly for
		updates. Continued use of the website after this Policy has been
		updated constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy. If you do not
		agree to this privacy policy, please contact us to terminate your
		account immediately.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Information collected from Third Parties.</strong><br>
		EvoLeads collects information from individuals when an individual
		provides information to a Third Party and EvoLeads subsequently
		purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the
		Third Party (the Seller). Such purchased information may include, but
		is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street
		address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and
		carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the
		SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital
		status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online
		interests, and such other information as the individual may have
		provided to the Seller (together, Third Party List Information). When
		acquiring Third Party List Information, EvoLeads seeks assurances from
		the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party
		List Information to EvoLeads and that the Seller has a right to
		provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal
		information is included on the Seller's list.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Information collected from Surveys.</strong><br> EvoLeads
		collects information from individuals by various methods, including,
		but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an
		EvoLeads survey, order form, or a registration page either online or
		offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or
		registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a Survey).
		(As used herein, online means using the Internet, including the
		Website, and related technologies, and offline means by methods other
		than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones
		and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, EvoLeads or
		a third party (a Third Party) may ask an individual to provide various
		information to EvoLeads, which may include his or her name, email
		address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell
		phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time
		and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range,
		education and marital status, occupation, social security number,
		employment information, personal and online interests, and such other
		information as may be requested from time to time (together, Survey
		Information). EvoLeads may also collect information concerning an
		individual from another source and use that information in combination
		with information provided from this Web Site. Completing the Surveys
		is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to
		provide Survey Information to EvoLeads or Third Party, but an
		individual may receive incentives from EvoLeads or a Third Party in
		exchange for providing Survey Information to EvoLeads.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Other information collected.</strong><br> Other occasions when
		EvoLeads obtains information from individuals include: <br> (a) when
		an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an
		incentive offered by EvoLeads or by a Third Party,<br> (b) when an
		individual requests assistance through EvoLead’s customer service
		department,&nbsp;<br> (c) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a
		EvoLeads service or newsletter (together, Other Information).
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Cookies.</strong><br> A cookie is a small amount of data
		stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows
		EvoLeads to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data
		that resides in EvoLead’s database. You may read more about cookies
		at <a href="http://cookiecentral.com" target="_blank">http://cookiecentral.com</a>
		. Individuals who use the Website need to accept cookies in order to
		use all of the features and functionality of the Website.
		<br>
		Under the GDPR, the lawful basis for collecting this information is that it is necessary for the performance of the contracts we have entered into and,
		for the purposes of scrutinizing applicants for fraud, our legitimate interests in preventing fraud.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Web Beacons.</strong><br> A web beacon generally a transparent
		graphic image (usually a very small pixel) that is placed on a website
		or in an email which is used to monitor behavior of a user visiting a
		website or email and store their information. This allows EvoLeads to
		track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are
		used to determine products or services an individual may be interested
		in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes.
		<br>
		Under the GDPR, the lawful basis for collecting this information is that it is necessary for the performance
		of the contracts we have entered into and, for the purposes of scrutinizing applicants for fraud, our legitimate interests in preventing fraud.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>IP Address.</strong><br> An IP Address is a form of
		identification and logical address of devices using Internet Protocol.
		EvoLeads uses IP Addresses to track and store information in
		EvoLead’s database.
		<br>
		Under the GDPR, the lawful basis for collecting this information is that we have a legitimate commercial interest 
		in determining how many unique users click on our advisements and preventing fraud. No more identifying information
		is collected about this group and so we cannot associate IPs with an identifiable individual.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Outside Information.</strong><br> EvoLeads may receive
		information about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources
		of information outside of EvoLeads including information located in
		public databases (Outside Information).
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Individual Information.</strong><br> As used herein,
		Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List
		Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside
		Information, and any other information EvoLeads gathers or receives
		about individuals such as usage data, file transfer and viewing data.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.</strong><br>
		EvoLeads will never knowingly collect any personal information about
		children under the age of 13. If EvoLeads obtains actual knowledge
		that it has collected personal information about a child under the age
		of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database.
		Because it does not collect such information, EvoLeads has no such
		information to use or to disclose to Third Parties. EvoLeads has
		designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online
		Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Credit Card Information.</strong><br> EvoLeads may in certain
		cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the
		expiration date of the card (Credit Card Information) when an
		individual places an order from EvoLeads. When the Credit Card
		Information is submitted to EvoLeads, such information is encrypted
		and is protected with SSL encryption software. EvoLeads will use the
		Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the
		purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be
		disclosed to Third Parties only as necessary to complete the purchase
		transaction. Any Credit Card information disclosed to Third Parties is
		not submitted to EvoLeads and EvoLeads does not have any control over
		such type of information.
	</p>

	<p>

		any information for any legal purpose in the company's sole
		discretion.

		provide promotional offers by email to individuals. EvoLeads may
		maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If email
		recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular

		message to unsubscribe from the particular list. To unsubscribe from
		all EvoLead’s email lists, a person must send an email to <a href="mailto:info@evoleads.com">info@evoleads.com</a> or sign into
		their account and make changes from there. EvoLeads only sends email
		to individuals who have agreed on the Website to receive email from
		EvoLeads or to individuals who have agreed on Third Party websites to
		receive email from Third Parties such as EvoLeads. EvoLeads does not
		send unsolicited email messages. As a result, statutes requiring
		certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to
		EvoLead’s email messages.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>2. Individual Information.</strong><br> EvoLeads stores the
		Individual Information in a database on EvoLeads computers and our
		hosting servers. Our computers have security measures (such as a
		firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration
		of the information under EvoLead’s control. Although we have these
		security measures, EvoLeads cannot guarantee that its security
		measures will prevent EvoLeads computers from being illegally
		accessed, and the Individual Information on them stolen or altered. By
		signing up you have agreed to understand that EvoLeads will not be
		liable for any information that has been hacked from our computers or
		servers.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Sell to Third Parties.</strong><br> EvoLeads holds the right
		to sell or transfer any type of information (individual, summary, etc)
		to third parties for any reason necessary.<br> <strong>Deleting and
			Updating Your Information</strong>.<br> If you would like to delete
		or update the personally identifiable information that we have
		collected from you (name, address, etc.), simply send your request to
		EvoLeads, LLC at <a href="mailto: info@evoleads.com">info@evoleads.com</a>.<br>
		We will process your request, where possible and subject to the terms
		and conditions contained herein, within a reasonable period of time
		after receipt. To protect your privacy and security, we will take
		reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access
		or making corrections. <br> <strong>Legal Process</strong>.<br>
		EvoLeads may disclose Individual Information to respond to subpoenas,
		court orders, and other legal processes.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Fraud/Scams.</strong><br> It is EvoLead’s right to close or
		dismiss any clients or accounts without pay if EvoLeads has a
		suspicion of fraudulent activity or a suspicion of scam. As a
		publisher or advertiser it is your duty to limit the fraudulent
		activity that appears on your account. EvoLeads holds the right to
		share any views on your account with other beneficiaries.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Advertiser cookies and web beacons.</strong><br> EvoLeads does
		not control Advertisers' use of such technology and EvoLeads has no
		responsibility for the use of such technology to gather information
		about individuals.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Links.</strong><br> The Website and email messages sometimes
		contain hypertext links to the web sites of Third Parties. EvoLeads is
		not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other
		web sites. Linked web sites may contain links to web sites maintained
		by Third Parties. Such links are provided for your convenience and
		reference only. EvoLeads does not operate or control in any respect
		any information, software, products or services available on such
		Third Party web sites. The inclusion of a link to a web site does not

		outside of the United States acknowledges that personal information
