    <p>This is the privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) that governs how uCool, Inc. and our affiliated companies
        ("uCool", "we", "our" or "us"), use Personal Data (defined below) that we collect, receive and store
        about you in connection with your use of our website: <a href="http://ucool.com/" target="_blank">http://ucool.com/</a>

        together with its sub-domains, content and services, a "Site").</p>
    <p>You may choose whether or not to provide or disclose Personal Data in connection with your use of our
        Site. If you choose not to provide the Personal Data we request, you may still visit and use parts of
        our Site, but may be unable to access or use certain features, options, programs, and services. Our Site
        may contain links to third-party websites and services that are not owned or controlled by uCool. We are
        not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third party websites, services and
        advertisements, and you visit them at your own risk.</p>

    <p class="f14 bold">1. Introduction. </p>
    <p>We are committed to respecting privacy and recognize the need for appropriate protection and management
        of any Personal Data that is shared with us as part of using our Site. As used in this Privacy Policy,

        information security and abuse prevention, to track user trends, and to analyze the effectiveness of our
        Site. Alone or in combination with other information, such automatically collected information may
        constitute Personal Data. Some of our service providers (described in Section 5, below) may use cookies

        web beacons) to gather information regarding your use of our websites and apps. The use of such
        information by a third party depends on the privacy policy available on that social network’s website,
        which we encourage you to carefully review. Such third parties may use these cookies or other tracking

        process or governmental request; (ii) enforce our terms of use, including investigations of potential
        violations thereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues; or (iv)

        categories of Personal Data through the account. </p>
    <p>If you would like to access, amend, erase, export (i.e., data portability), or object to or restrict the

        to us at:</p>

    <p>Suite 320</p>
    <p>Santa Clara, CA, 95054</p>
    <br>
    <p>Depending on where you live, you may have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority or
        other regulatory agency if you believe that we have violated any of the rights concerning Personal Data
        about you. We encourage you to first reach out to us at legal@ucool.com so we have an opportunity to
        address your concerns directly before you do so.</p>

    <p class="f14 bold">7.2. Opting-Out of Promotional Emails.</p>
    <p>You may choose not to receive future promotional or advertising emails from us by selecting an
        unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email that you receive from us, or by responding to the emails
        directly and requesting removal if such a link is not available. Additionally, you may send a request
        specifying your communications preferences to legal@ucool.com. Customers cannot opt out of receiving
        transactional emails related to their account with us or our services. Please note that even if you opt
        out of receiving the foregoing emails, we may still send you a response to any "Contact Us" request as
        well as administrative, maintenance and operational emails (for example, in connection with a password
        reset request).</p>

    <p class="f14 bold">8. Personal Data Transferred from the EU or Switzerland To The United States.</p>
    <p>uCool complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework
        (collectively, “Privacy Shield”) as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection,
        use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union (the “EU”) member countries and Switzerland.
        uCool has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of
        Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation,
        Access, and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability. A violation of our commitment to Privacy Shield may be
        investigated by the Federal Trade Commission and/or the United States Department of Commerce. If there
        is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the
        Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our
        certification page, to the extent available, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov.</p>
    <p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, uCool commits to resolve complaints about your privacy
        and our collection or use of Personal Data about you. Persons from the EU or Switzerland who have
        inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy should first contact us via email at:
        legal@ucool.com.</p>
    <p>uCool has committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to JAMS,
        an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely
        acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit
        https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information and to file a complaint.</p>
    <p>These recourse mechanisms are available at no cost to you. Damages may be awarded in accordance with
        applicable law. Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited
        circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel. In cases of
        onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the Privacy
        Shield, uCool is potentially liable.</p>

    <p class="f14 bold">9. Data Security. </p>
    <p>The security of Personal Data is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to
        protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no
        method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore,
        while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its
        absolute security.</p>

    <p class="f14 bold">10. Children's Privacy. </p>
    <p>10.1. Children Under 13.</p>
    <p>Children under the age of 13 should not use our websites or games at any time. In the event that we are
        able to confirm that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from children under the age of
        13, we will take reasonable measures to promptly remove such information from our records. We do not
        knowingly collect or store any Personal Data from children under 13. If parents believe that we have
        unintentionally collected their children’s’ Personal Data, they may request the deletion of the
        information by contacting us at: </p>
    <p>uCool, Inc. </p>
    <p>Attn: Legal </p>

    <p>They may also e-mail us at legal@ucool.com.</p>

    <p class="f14 bold">10.2. Note to Parents.</p>
    <p>We recognize a special obligation to protect Personal Data about young children. We urge parents to
        instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without
        permission, when on-line. Teenagers under the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage their
        parents to review this Privacy Policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke our opt-out policy
        or to raise any concerns. </p>

    <p class="f14 bold">11. How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals. </p>
    <p>uCool does not track Site users over time and across third party websites to provide targeted
        advertising. Accordingly, we do not currently respond or take any action with respect to web browser "do
        not track" signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding
        the collection of Personal Data about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across
        third-party web sites or online services.</p>

    <p class="f14 bold">12. Your California Privacy Rights. </p>
    <p>If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request
        information regarding the disclosure of Personal Data about you by uCool to third parties for the third
        parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to legal@ucool.com or
