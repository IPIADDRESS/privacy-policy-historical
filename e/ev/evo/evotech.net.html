<p>EvoTech and its Affiliate websites have a firm commitment to protecting your privacy. We operate our website under the following guidelines to safeguard our users' personal information. We may revise our policy from time to time, so please check this page periodically. </p>

<h1>Personal/Company Information. </h1>
<p> To operate our services, Evolution Tecnologies asks for personal and company information in the member's registration form, such as your name, title, your company name, company address, and other company only identifying information. We do this, for example, when you register your company (or yourself) when you request a site evaluation. We use this individual company information to notify you of the results of a evaluation, to deliver member only newsletters, and other service-related purposes.<br>
<br>
Evolution Tecnologies may also automatically collect information such as your web browser type or IP address. This information is used to ensure our website displays properly on most commonly used browsers. </p>
<h1>Updating or Opting-Out </h1>
<p> If you would like to opt-out of a mailing list member of Evolution Tecnologies, please send an email to <a href="noSpam('information', 'evotech.net');" onfocus="this.blur();">information@EvoTech.net</a> or call us at 415.845.9906. We will delete you from our database.</p>
<h1>Cookies </h1>
<p> Evolution Tecnologies may place a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. The cookie itself does not contain any individual information about you, although it will enable Evolution Tecnologies to relate your use of our site to information that you have specifically provided to us. We may use cookies to provide you with information, to save your password so that you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, for retaining you selections between screens during a session, and for other purposes. The first time you register on to our site, you may be asked to accept a cookie. The cookie will remember your user name and password every time you access the site. You do not need to accept this cookie to use our services, but you will have to enter your name and password every time you visit password protected areas of the site.</p>
<h1>Links to Other Sites </h1>
<p> Our site contains links to other sites outside our service. These other sites may send cookies to users, collect data, or solicit individual information. These sites or services also have separate data and privacy practices. Evolution Tecnologies and its Affilliate websites disclaim any responsibility or liability for their policies or actions. When we link to other sites, we do not pass your personal information to those sites. In addition, Evolution Tecnologies offers services in conjunction with partner companies. In order to provide these co-branded services to you, we may share your personal information with our partner company. We will not be providing these services to you without a written contract, which will include more information about subcontracted services. </p>
<p>Evolution Tecnologies will NOT disclose any personal information except as described above, as required by law or to protect our interests. Evolution Tecnologies does disclose user information, including demographic data, in an aggregated form that does not identify individual users in order to describe its services to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties and for other lawful purposes. </p>
<p>If at any time you believe that Evolution Tecnologies has not adhered to these principles, please notify us promptly by email to <a href="noSpam('information', 'evotech.net');" onfocus="this.blur();">information@EvoTech.net</a>, or via our contact information below.</p>
