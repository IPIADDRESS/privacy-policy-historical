<p class="f16 bold" style="margin-top:0px;">uCool Privacy Policy	</p><br>
<p class="f16 bold">YOUR USE OF THE  UCOOL SITES AND SERVICES IS SUBJECT TO YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p><br>
<p>uCool, Inc. and its related licensees and licensors (collectively "uCool") respect the privacy of its on-line visitors and recognize the importance of providing a secure and safe environment for them. In meeting this goal, we instituted an On-Line Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us. This Privacy Policy details how uCool safeguards the privacy of its on-line visitors and applies to all services which are offered on uCool internet sites.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, complaints, or comments regarding our privacy policy statement or policies, please contact our Privacy Policy Administrator at <a href="mailto:legal@ucool.com">legal@ucool.com</a>.</p>

<p class="f14 bold">What personal information is collected from you directly?</p>
<p>uCool only collects information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") from you when you: (1) register to use a Game; (2) contact us; (3) order products and services from us; and (4) participate in our surveys or promotional activities. All Personal Information provided is voluntary and is limited to contact Data (such as your name and email address); If you communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards, or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys, or Tournament entries, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information.</p>
<p class="f14 bold">What other types of information may we collect?</p>
<p>Your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding your computer (capabilities, game data processing, etc.) to uCool and/or the Games being played. uCool may use this information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community. In addition, uCool may use such information for security, system integrity (the prevention of hacking, cheats, etc.), or IP protection or enforcement purposes.</p>
<p class="f14 bold">How do we use the information you provide?</p>
<p>We use your information in order to constantly improve our range of services to satisfy the user's needs. The information you provide uCool will allow us to process payment orders, alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle/route your customer service or technical support questions or issues; and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities, contests, promotions, or special events and offers. You will be informed as part of these communications that you may cancel notifications at any time.</p>
<p>Lastly, we may use your information for internal marketing, profiling, or demographic purposes, so we can adapt our products and services to better suit your needs. We do this to better understand and serve our customers.</p>
<p>Please be advised that personal information submitted by individuals acting solely in a business capacity (e.g., personal information contained in job applicant's resume) is not subject to the uses set forth above or to any other practices stated in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Third-party web sites and companies with links to and from the uCool Sites and Services, including Facebook, may collect personally identifiable information about users. You should be aware that these third-party web sites or links may have their own information collection practices and privacy policies. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties that have web sites linked to the uCool Sites and Services. If you are utilizing such a site or click on a third-party advertisement or link, the privacy policies of the third-party web site that you are using or link to will govern the use of your information by that web site’s operator. uCool’s Privacy Policy does not extend to these external web sites and companies. Please refer directly to these companies and web sites regarding their privacy policies. We assume no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third parties with respect to their use of your information or otherwise. Accordingly, please make sure you are aware of and comfortable with the privacy policies of any third-party web sites to which you follow a link.</p>


<p class="f14 bold">With whom may your information be shared?</p>
<p>uCool may need to disclose your account information to third party vendors to fulfill purchase orders or prizes, to process mailings, or to process, analyze, and/or store data. We will attempt to ensure that these entities do not use your account information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>uCool may disclose your account information or otherwise use such information to communicate with you if required or permitted to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process or any governmental request; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of uCool or its licensees or licensors; (c) enforce the Terms of Service or any applicable License Agreements; or (d) protect the personal safety or interests of uCool employees, users of uCool products or services, or members of the public in urgent circumstances. We also may disclose your account information to a third-party that alleges that you have infringed their intellectual property rights, subject to reasonable verification of such claims.</p>
<p>From time to time, uCool may provide online in-game chat rooms and/or forums to users. Any information that is disclosed in these chat rooms and forums is public information and users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in such chat rooms and forums. If you voluntarily disclose information in a public area of the uCool Sites and Services, such as a forums post or text chat room, that information may be collected and used by a third-party to send you unsolicited messages, advertisements or for other purposes. We do not control the actions of these third parties in public areas of the uCool Sites and Services, so if you disclose information in a public area, you do so at your own risk.</p>
