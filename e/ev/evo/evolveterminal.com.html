The only way we know something about you personally is if you provide it to us.  In order to process certain transactions, we may also need to collect payment information from you (e.g., credit card information) which will not be shared with anyone outside of Evolve PR Inc., its affiliates and the financial institutions and vendors used to process payments.  We do not intentionally collect any sensitive information, such as information concerning race, religion, health, sexual orientation or political beliefs.  Please do not send any sensitive personal information to us.
