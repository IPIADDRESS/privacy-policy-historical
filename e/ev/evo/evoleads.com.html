		<h1>EvoMarketplace, Inc, Privacy Policy</h1>

		<div class="policy">

			<br> <br>
			<p>Last updated: September 16, 2015.</p>
			<p>
				EvoLeads outlines important information in this Privacy Policy
				regarding the use and disclosure of information collected via <a href="http://www.evoleads.com" target="_blank">www.evoleads.com</a>.<br>
				EvoLeads provides this Privacy Policy to help users make an informed
				decision as to whether to use or continue using this website. EvoLeads
				is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices
				of third web sites or applications.
			</p>

			<p>This Privacy Policy applies to EvoLead’s collection, use, storage
				and disclosure of information by EvoLeads on its (a) websites,
				including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies
				(collectively, the Website), (b) on various third party websites, and
				(c) to EvoLead’s other information collection, including the
				purchase of customer lists from third parties.</p>

			<p>Note: EvoLeads has the right to change this privacy policy at
				anytime. It is the user's responsibility to check back regularly for
				updates. Continued use of the website after this Policy has been
				updated constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy. If you do not
				agree to this privacy policy, please contact us to terminate your
				account immediately.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Information collected from Third Parties.</strong><br>
				EvoLeads collects information from individuals when an individual
				provides information to a Third Party and EvoLeads subsequently
				purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the
				Third Party (the Seller). Such purchased information may include, but
				is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street
				address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and
				carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the
				SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital
				status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online
				interests, and such other information as the individual may have
				provided to the Seller (together, Third Party List Information). When
				acquiring Third Party List Information, EvoLeads seeks assurances from
				the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party
				List Information to EvoLeads and that the Seller has a right to
				provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal
				information is included on the Seller's list.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Information collected from Surveys.</strong><br> EvoLeads
				collects information from individuals by various methods, including,
				but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an
				EvoLeads survey, order form, or a registration page either online or
				offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or
				registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a Survey).
				(As used herein, online means using the Internet, including the
				Website, and related technologies, and offline means by methods other
				than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones
				and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, EvoLeads or
				a third party (a Third Party) may ask an individual to provide various
				information to EvoLeads, which may include his or her name, email
				address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell
				phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time
				and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range,
				education and marital status, occupation, social security number,
				employment information, personal and online interests, and such other
				information as may be requested from time to time (together, Survey
				Information). EvoLeads may also collect information concerning an
				individual from another source and use that information in combination
				with information provided from this Web Site. Completing the Surveys
				is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to
				provide Survey Information to EvoLeads or Third Party, but an
				individual may receive incentives from EvoLeads or a Third Party in
				exchange for providing Survey Information to EvoLeads.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Other information collected.</strong><br> Other occasions when
				EvoLeads obtains information from individuals include: <br> (a) when
				an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an
				incentive offered by EvoLeads or by a Third Party,<br> (b) when an
				individual requests assistance through EvoLead’s customer service
				department,&nbsp;<br> (c) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a
				EvoLeads service or newsletter (together, Other Information).
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Cookies.</strong><br> A cookie is a small amount of data
				stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows
				EvoLeads to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data
				that resides in EvoLead’s database. You may read more about cookies
				at <a href="http://cookiecentral.com" target="_blank">http://cookiecentral.com</a>
				. Individuals who use the Website need to accept cookies in order to
				use all of the features and functionality of the Website.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Web Beacons.</strong><br> A web beacon generally a transparent
				graphic image (usually a very small pixel) that is placed on a website
				or in an email which is used to monitor behavior of a user visiting a
				website or email and store their information. This allows EvoLeads to
				track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are
				used to determine products or services an individual may be interested
				in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>IP Address.</strong><br> An IP Address is a form of
				identification and logical address of devices using Internet Protocol.
				EvoLeads uses IP Addresses to track and store information in
				EvoLead’s database.

				information about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources
				of information outside of EvoLeads including information located in
				public databases (Outside Information).
			</p>

				<strong>Individual Information.</strong><br> As used herein,
				Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List

				purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be

				Individual Information in a database on EvoLeads computers and our
				hosting servers. Our computers have security measures (such as a
				firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration
				of the information under EvoLead’s control. Although we have these
				security measures, EvoLeads cannot guarantee that its security
				measures will prevent EvoLeads computers from being illegally
				accessed, and the Individual Information on them stolen or altered. By
				signing up you have agreed to understand that EvoLeads will not be
				liable for any information that has been hacked from our computers or
				servers.
