	<br> <br>
	<p>Last updated: March 30, 2013.</p>
	<p>
		EvoLeads outlines important information in this Privacy Policy
		regarding the use and disclosure of information collected via <a href="http://www.evoleads.com" target="_blank">www.evoleads.com</a>.<br>
		EvoLeads provides this Privacy Policy to help users make an informed
		decision as to whether to use or continue using this website. EvoLeads
		is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices
		of third web sites or applications.
	</p>

	<p>This Privacy Policy applies to EvoLead’s collection, use, storage
		and disclosure of information by EvoLeads on its (a) websites,
		including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies
		(collectively, the Website), (b) on various third party websites, and
		(c) to EvoLead’s other information collection, including the
		purchase of customer lists from third parties.</p>

	<p>Note: EvoLeads has the right to change this privacy policy at
		anytime. It is the user's responsibility to check back regularly for
		updates. Continued use of the website after this Policy has been
		updated constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy. If you do not
		agree to this privacy policy, please contact us to terminate your
		account immediately.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Information collected from Third Parties.</strong><br>
		EvoLeads collects information from individuals when an individual
		provides information to a Third Party and EvoLeads subsequently
		purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the
		Third Party (the Seller). Such purchased information may include, but
		is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street
		address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and
		carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the
		SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital
		status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online
		interests, and such other information as the individual may have
		provided to the Seller (together, Third Party List Information). When
		acquiring Third Party List Information, EvoLeads seeks assurances from
		the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party
		List Information to EvoLeads and that the Seller has a right to
		provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal
		information is included on the Seller's list.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Information collected from Surveys.</strong><br> EvoLeads
		collects information from individuals by various methods, including,
		but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an
		EvoLeads survey, order form, or a registration page either online or
		offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or
		registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a Survey).
		(As used herein, online means using the Internet, including the
		Website, and related technologies, and offline means by methods other
		than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones
		and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, EvoLeads or
		a third party (a Third Party) may ask an individual to provide various
		information to EvoLeads, which may include his or her name, email
		address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell
		phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time
		and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range,
		education and marital status, occupation, social security number,
		employment information, personal and online interests, and such other
		information as may be requested from time to time (together, Survey
		Information). EvoLeads may also collect information concerning an
		individual from another source and use that information in combination
		with information provided from this Web Site. Completing the Surveys
		is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to
		provide Survey Information to EvoLeads or Third Party, but an
		individual may receive incentives from EvoLeads or a Third Party in
		exchange for providing Survey Information to EvoLeads.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Other information collected.</strong><br> Other occasions when
		EvoLeads obtains information from individuals include: <br> (a) when
		an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an
		incentive offered by EvoLeads or by a Third Party,<br> (b) when an
		individual requests assistance through EvoLead’s customer service
		department,&nbsp;<br> (c) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a
		EvoLeads service or newsletter (together, Other Information).
