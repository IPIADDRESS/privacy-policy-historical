This information is used for billing purposes and to fill users orders.

We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small file stored on users hard drives for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.</p> <p>Use of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information while on the Site except if users choose to store their phone numbers and passwords so that users do not have to enter it each time they access their account. Then a persistent cookie will be stored on your computer which is linked to your account information.</p> <p>If you reject the persistent cookie, you may still use the Site but you will be limited in some areas of it. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on the Site. See the Profile section below.</p> <p>Some of our business partners (for example, third party advertisers) may use cookies on the Site, in emails or in our advertisements on other Web sites. The cookies are not linked to any personally identifiable information. This Policy covers the use of cookies by the Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any third party advertisers. Our third party advertisers have their own privacy policies which you should consult. In order to create a user-friendly experience, some of our third party promotions and advertisements are designed to automatically transmit users information onto the third party's landing page when users chooses to click upon a third party's advertisement or promotion.

Clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller than cookies, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of receiving promotional emails, please see the "Choice/Opt-out" section below.</p> </li> <li type="a"><b>Profile</b> <p>We may store information that we collect through cookies, log files and clear gifs to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences and Services usage. We may also gather information about users and users' preferences from third parties. Please see the Third Party Intermediaries; Supplementation of Information section below. Consequently, information may be tied to users' personally identifiable information to improve the content of the Site for users, improve our Services and provide new services that are likely to be of interest to users and to direct pertinent product updates and marketing promotions to users if they have opted in to receive those promotions.</p> </li> <li type="a"><b>Children's Privacy</b> <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
