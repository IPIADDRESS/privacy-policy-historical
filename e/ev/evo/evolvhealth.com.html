<h3>Profile Information<!-- Profile Information --></h3>
<p>EvolvHealth stores information that it collects through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of visitors to our websites (“users”), including customers, Registered Customers, and Members. A profile is stored information that EvolvHealth keeps on individual users that details their viewing preferences. Profile information is tied to the user’s personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. EvolvHealth does not share profile information with other third parties.<!-- EvolvHealth stores information that it collects through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of visitors to our websites ("users"), including customers, Registered Customers, and Members.

<h3>Cookies<!-- Cookies --></h3>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user’s computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on the websites. EvolvHealth uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.<!-- A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's computer tied to information about the user.

<p>By setting a cookie on a user’s computer, users do not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while at the websites. If a user rejects the cookie, the user will still be able to use the site. The only drawback to this is that the user may need to enter his or her password every time he or she accesses the site.<!-- By setting a cookie on a user's computer, users do not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while at the websites.

<h3>Log Files<!-- Log Files --></h3>
<p>Like most standard website servers EvolvHealth’s websites use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable our web-based service. We use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyze user movement.<!-- Like most standard website servers EvolvHealth's websites use log files.

<h3>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)<!-- Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) --></h3>
<p>EvolvHealth employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help EvolvHealth to better manage content on the websites by informing it what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users’ personally identifiable information.<!-- EvolvHealth employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.
