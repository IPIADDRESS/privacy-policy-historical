      <p><span class="newsHeader">Wind-up Privacy Policy</span><br>
        We are committed to protecting the privacy 
        and security of the users of our sites.<br>
        This privacy policy (the "Policy") governs our use of information 
        collected online only and does not apply to any information we may collect 
      offline.</p>
      <p>This Policy informs you of how we use and protect 
        your personal information and about what choices you have concerning our 
        use of such information. Please read this Policy carefully. We reserve 
        the right to change this Policy from time to time in order to address 
        new issues and reflect changes on our sites. We will post any changes 
        on this page so that you will always know what information we gather, 
        how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose that information 
        to anyone. Please refer back to this Policy regularly.<br>
        <br>
        If you have any questions or concerns about this Policy, please send us 
        e-mail to: <a href="mailto:privacy@wind-upent.com">privacy@wind-upent.com</a>.<br><br>
        <span class="newsHeader">USERS UNDER 13</span><br>
        WE WILL NOT KNOWINGLY COLLECT ANY PERSONAL 
        INFORMATION FROM ANY PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF 13. PERSONS UNDER THE AGE 
        OF 13 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN WIND-UP'S STREET TEAMS.<br>
        <br>
        Note to Parents: We urge all parents to participate in their children's 
        exploration of the Internet and any online services, and to teach their 
        children about protecting their personal information while online. If 
        you have any concerns about Wind-up's websites, street teams or related 
        services, please e-mail: <a href="mailto:privacy@wind-upent.com">privacy@wind-upent.com</a>.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="newsHeader"> Personal Identification Information</span><br>
        We will only collect personally identifiable 
        information from you (such as your full name, street address, telephone 
        number, credit card number and e-mail address) that you voluntarily submit 
        to us in connection with your use of the site, such as in connection with 
        participation in our street teams, contests, sweepstakes, e-news lists, 
        games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content submissions, 
        chats, bulletin boards, discussion groups, requests for suggestions, visitors' 
        requests for free products or services or additional information, and 
        other activities, services or resources we make available on any of our 
        sites. Except as described in this Policy, we will never intentionally 
        disclose any personally identifiable information about you as an individual 
        user to any third party without having received your permission. <br>
        <br>
        If you do provide us with personally identifiable information, we may 
        use it to conduct the activities described above, to respond to your questions 
        or comments, to contact you to confirm your registration, to contact you 
        about your account, or to contact you regarding changes to the Wind-up 
        Sites' Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy.<br>
        <br>
        If you give us permission, we may also use personally identifiable information 
        for internal or external marketing and promotional purposes. On occasion, 
        for example, we may send you e-mails to introduce a product or service 
        that we think might be of interest to you. For us to obtain your permission 
        to send you this information, we will give you an opportunity to "opt-in" 
        when you provide your personal information. If you do "opt-in," 
        you may choose to "opt-out" at any time, even after you have 
        provided personal information, by following the procedures set forth below 
        at the end of this Policy. Please note, however, that under certain circumstances, 
        if you initially do not choose to "opt-in," the change may not 
        be retroactive, or if you later "opt-out," you may not be eligible 
        for certain benefits for which a name, e-mail address, telephone number 
      or other personal identification information is needed.</p>
      <p class="tourText">We may use third party 
        service providers to help us operate our business and the Site or administer 
        activities on our behalf, such as sweepstakes administration. We may share 
        your information with these third parties for those limited purposes.<br>
        <br>
        We will release specific information about you or your account to comply 
        with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute 
        or court order. We will also release specific information in special cases, 
        such as if there is an attempted breach of the security of the sites, 
        or a physical threat to you or others. If Wind-up is sold to, or merges 
        with, another company, or declares bankruptcy, some or all of the information 
        collected from you may be transferred to a third party as a result of 
      the transfer of assets.</p>
      <p>Please note that if you give out personal information 
        online -- for example, through a message board or chat room -- that information 
        can be collected and used by third parties. Although we strive to protect 
        our users' privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of information you 
        post in these forums. You disclose such information at your own risk.<br><br>
        <span class="newsHeader">Non-Personal Identification Information And The 
        Use Of Cookie Technology</span><br>
        We may collect non-personal identification 
        information through the use of "cookie" technology and/or IP 
        address tracking. Most browsers are set to accept cookies. You can set 
        your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being 
        sent. If you do so, please note that some parts of the Wind-up Sites, 
        such as message boards, chats, shopping, contests, and game areas, may 
        not function properly. Non-personal identification information might include 
        the browser you use, the type of computer, the operating systems, the 
        Internet service providers, and other similar information. Our system 
        also automatically gathers information about the areas you visit on our 
        sites and about the links you may select from within our site to other 
      areas of the World Wide Web or elsewhere online.</p>
      <p class="tourText">We may use information 
        in the aggregate to understand how our users as a group use the services 
        and resources provided on our sites. This way we know which areas of our 
        sites are favorites of our users, which areas need improvement, and what 
        technologies are being used so that we may continually improve our sites. 
        We may share this aggregate statistical information with our partners, 
        suppliers and other third parties, but we will not share any individual 
        names, personal navigational or other personal information.</p>
      <p>We may also collect demographic 
        information that you provide to us, such as your zip code, age or income 
        level. We use your demographic information to tailor the site to your 
        interests. We may share demographic information on an aggregate non-identifiable 
        basis with third parties. Although we do not at the present time, we may, 
        at some time in the future, have advertisers with display ads on our sites 
        that solicit or contain technology to collect information about our users 
        for the advertisers, but we will not permit such advertisers to collect 
        any personal information from our users within our sites.<br>
        <span class="newsHeader"><br>
        Links To Other Sites</span><br>
        Users will find advertising or other contents 
        on our sites that link to the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, 
        advertisers, sponsors, licensors, and other third parties. In many cases, 
        the links represent cooperative projects or are mutual links established 
        with persons or entities connected with our sites. Although we initially 
        visit the sites or services that are so linked, we do not control the 
        contents or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for 
        their content or privacy practices. In addition, these sites or services, 
        including their contents and links, may be constantly changing. These 
        sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service 
        policies, or no policy (policies) at all. We encourage you to review the 
        privacy policies of any third party sites or services before providing 
        any of them with your personal information.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="newsHeader">Security Policy</span><br>Although we take careful measures to 
        secure both your information and our physical premises, "perfect 
        security" does not exist on the Internet and our efforts in this 
        regard must necessarily be limited by what is practical in light of our 
        equipment and technology.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="newsHeader">Access To/Correction of Information</span><br>
        If you would like to review or edit any personal 
        information we have retained about you in our database, visit the <a href="http://www.winduplist.com">User 
        Profile</a> section of our site or send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@wind-upent.com">privacy@wind-upent.com</a>.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="newsHeader">Choice/Opt-Out</span><br>
        If you "opt-in" to receive information from Wind-up or others, 
        you can change your mind later. If at any time you would like to stop 
        receiving such information, you can let us know by sending an e-mail stating 
        your preference to <a href="mailto:privacy@wind-upent.com">privacy@wind-upent.com</a>.<br><br>
        <span class="newsHeader"> Your Acceptance of These Terms</span><br>
        By using any of the Wind-up sites, you signify 
        your acceptance of this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please 
        do not use our sites. Your continued use of the Wind-up Sites following 
        the posting of changes to this Policy will be deemed your acceptance of 
        those changes.<br>
