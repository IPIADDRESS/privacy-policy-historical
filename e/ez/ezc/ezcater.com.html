      <h4>
         What information do we collect and how do we use it?
      </h4>
      <p>
         So we can serve you, you give us information such as your contact or billing information,
         or details about orders or client needs. In addition, we log interactions such as
         visits to our website, orders placed, and communications among you, us, and third parties such as food providers, 
         delivery companies, and delivery locations.
      </p>

      <p>
         We use the information provided to place orders with caterers to deliver food and services to whatever location(s)
         you designate, to create caterer profiles, and to send occasional newsletters out. To opt out of newsletters, please
         follow the directions in the emails or change your account preferences in your Profile page.
      </p>

      <p>
         We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy
         policy. We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business
         activities such as a payment processor or mapping provider. These companies are authorized to use your personal
         information only as necessary to provide these services to us. For instance, we communicate order details to the
         food provider, any delivery service, and perhaps also to the party receiving the food.
      </p>

      <p>
         If you place orders with us, you may receive communications regarding status updates, promotions, newly-
         available food providers, etc. ez<i>Rewards</i>™ members can receive communications relating to that program. And
         unless you opt out, we may share your contact (but never your billing) information with selected third parties
         whose offers we believe you may value. To opt out of this sharing please change your account preferences in your
         Profile page.
      </p>

      <p>
         If you are the recipient of food ordered through ezCater, your delivery-related information and dietary needs
         may be communicated to food providers, delivery companies, or other parties as needed so they can serve you.
         If you choose to designate an alternate contact person, we will ask you for their name. We will send the alternate
         contact information to the caterer. ezCater stores this information and it is only used for the sole purpose of
         handling your food order.
      </p>

      <h4>
         How do we protect your information?
      </h4>
      <p>
         We use state-of-the-art protection. All password and billing information you provide on our
         website is transmitted via a secure connection called "Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) with 128-bit
         encryption," and then stored in a secure environment.
      </p>

      <p>
         We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
         transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
         electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Please contact us if you
         have any questions about security on our web site.
      </p>
