   information and how you can access and update this information.

   reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy-program-requirements/" target="_blank">TRUSTe's Program Requirements</a>
   including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. 
   The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this web site <a href="http://www.ezcater.com">www.ezcater.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
   TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations

   regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ezcater.com">support@ezcater.com</a>. If you are not satisfied with

<h5>
   What information do we collect and how do we use it?
</h5>
<p>
   So we can serve you, you give us information such as your contact or billing information,
   or details about orders or client needs. In addition, we log interactions such as
   visits to our website, orders placed, and communications among you, us, and third parties such as food providers, 
   delivery companies, and delivery locations.
</p>

<p>
   We use the information provided to place orders with caterers to deliver food and services to whatever location(s)
   you designate, to create caterer profiles, and to send occasional newsletters out. To opt out of newsletters, please
   follow the directions in the emails or change your account preferences in your Profile page.
</p>

<p>
   We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy
   policy. We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business
   activities such as a payment processor or mapping provider. These companies are authorized to use your personal
   information only as necessary to provide these services to us. For instance, we communicate order details to the
   food provider, any delivery service, and perhaps also to the party receiving the food.
</p>

<p>
   If you place orders with us, you may receive communications regarding status updates, promotions, newly-
   available food providers, etc. ez<i>Rewards</i>™ members can receive communications relating to that program. And
   unless you opt out, we may share your contact (but never your billing) information with selected third parties
   whose offers we believe you may value. To opt out of this sharing please change your account preferences in your
   Profile page.
</p>

<p>
   If you are the recipient of food ordered through ezCater, your delivery-related information and dietary needs
   may be communicated to food providers, delivery companies, or other parties as needed so they can serve you.
   If you choose to designate an alternate contact person, we will ask you for their name. We will send the alternate
   contact information to the caterer. ezCater stores this information and it is only used for the sole purpose of
   handling your food order.
</p>

<h5>
   How do we protect your information?
</h5>
<p>
   We use state-of-the-art protection. All password and billing information you provide on our
   website is transmitted via a secure connection called "Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) with 128-bit
   encryption," and then stored in a secure environment.
</p>

<p>
   We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
   transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
   electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Please contact us if you
   have any questions about security on our web site.
</p>

<h5>
   What tracking technologies do we use?
</h5>

<p>

   more quickly. You can always delete ezCater cookies by following the instructions in your browser's help section. 
</p>

   change how we use your information.
</p>
<p>
   We reserve the right to convey to third parties information that has been modified so the information cannot be traced back to a specific person or company.
</p>
<p>
   We may disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar
   legal process; when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety
   or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request; and to any other third party with
   your prior consent to do so. We may transfer your information in the course of a corporate divestiture, merger, or
   dissolution. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our web site of any change in ownership or
   uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
