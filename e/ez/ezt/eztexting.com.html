                <p class="body-text">Please know that you will retain ownership of any  information that you may include in your account and contact lists in order to  identify recipients of your messages through EZ Texting’s services, and Ez Texting will not use contact lists   for its own promotional campaigns or sell contact lists to third-parties, subject at  all times to EZ Texting’s need to access and use such information in order to  provide the services pursuant to its Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p class="body-text">We may use such personally identifiable information to  provide the services that you have requested, to contact you about programs,  products, features or services in which we believe you may be interested (such  as future promotional materials), or for other purposes disclosed from time to  time.&nbsp; We also may use your personally identifiable information to contact  you regarding your use of our Website or changes to our Privacy Policy, <u>Terms  of Service</u>, or other policies or terms that affect you and your use of our  Website and services.&nbsp; In addition, we  may use information collected about our users to improve the content and  navigation of our Website, or for other internal purposes.</p>
                <p class="body-text">We may, from time to time, supplement the information we  collect from you with outside records (e.g., information we obtain from other  companies, including wireless providers) to enhance our ability to serve you,  to tailor our content to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase  products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
                <p class="body-text">To fulfill your requests for products and services, we  may share the personally identifiable information you provide with your cell  phone service provider or their partner and subcontractor companies.&nbsp;  Please know that this Privacy Policy does not cover such entities use of  information. To learn more about your provider’s privacy practices, you should  consult its privacy policy. <br>
                In addition, we may disclose personally identifiable  information collected about you in the following instances:<br>
    </p><blockquote>
      <p class="body-text"><strong>A. Legal  Action:</strong> We may disclose information about our users, including  personally identifiable information; (i) when requested by governmental or  quasi-governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (ii) if required to  do so by subpoena, court order or legal process; (iii) to verify or enforce  compliance with the policies governing our Website and applicable laws; or (iv)  to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Website. We also may  disclose user information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit  our legal liability; to protect or defend our rights or property; or protect  the safety, rights, or property of our users.</p>
        <p class="body-text"><strong>B. Change in Control:</strong> We may  sell, transfer, or otherwise disclose user information, including personally  identifiable information, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate  merger, consolidation, the sale of substantially all assets, or other corporate  change respecting Ez Texting, the Website and/or the services offered hereby.<br>
        Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise  stated at the time personally-identifiable information is gathered, Ez Texting  will not provide personally-identifiable information to third parties who are  not under the direction and control of Ez Texting. <br>
        </p>    </blockquote>  
    <p class="body-text"><strong>3. Cookies</strong><br>
   

            To enhance your experience with the Website, we may use "cookies" on  our Website. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your  computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to  recognize your browser and to provide features. Cookies, by themselves, do not  tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless  you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at  our Website. However, once you become a customer and furnish the Website with  personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data  stored in the cookie.<br>
            We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve  the content and offerings on our Website. For example, we may use cookies to  personalize your experience at our Website (e.g., to recognize you when you  return to the Website). With most internet browsers, you can erase cookies from  your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a  cookie is stored. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser  for more information. However, certain areas of the Website can be accessed  only in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware  that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some  of our content.</p>
    <p class="body-text"><strong>4. Children </strong><br>
            The Website is not directed at individuals less than thirteen (13) years of  age, and Ez Texting does not intend to collect any personally-identifiable  information from such individuals, unless otherwise stated at the time such  information is collected. <br>
        </p>
    <p class="body-text"><strong>5. Information Collected Automatically </strong><br>
            Ez Texting may also (i) automatically collect non-personally-identifiable information  about your use of the Website, such as the domain from which you access the  Internet (for example, Comcast.net, if you are connecting from a Comcast  account), the date and time you access the Website, and the Internet address of  the website from which you linked directly to our Website; and (ii) use data  capture and analysis tools, and other similar tools, to extract, compile and  analyze any non-personally identifiable data or information resulting from your  use of the Website and the services offered thereon (collectively “<u>Blind  Data</u>”).&nbsp; To the extent that any Blind Data is collected by Ez Texting,  such Blind Data shall be solely owned by Ez Texting and may be used by Ez  Texting for any lawful business purpose, including, without limitation, analyzing  and enhancing the Website and services offered hereby, disclosing such Blind  Data to third parties for a variety of purposes.</p>
    <p class="body-text"><strong>6. Links to Other Websites </strong><br>
            The Website may contain links to third party websites, whose information  practices may be different than Ez Texting’s. Visitors should consult such  third-party sites’ privacy notices as Ez Texting does not have any control over  information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.&nbsp;  Ez Texting does not make any representations or warranties as to the security  of any information (including, without limitation, credit card and other  personal information) you might be requested to give any third party.&nbsp; <br>
            </p>
    <p class="body-text">These links are provided solely as a convenience to you  and not as an endorsement by Ez Texting of the contents on such third-party  websites.&nbsp; Ez Texting cannot ensure that you will be satisfied with any  products or services that you purchase from a third-party site that links to or  from the Website, since these sites are owned and operated by independent  retailers.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">Ez Texting is not responsible for the content of linked  third-party sites and does not make any representations regarding the content  or accuracy of materials on such third-party sites.&nbsp; Ez Texting has not  taken any steps to confirm the accuracy or reliability of any of the  information contained in such third-party sites.&nbsp; If you decide to access  linked third-party sites, you do so at you own risk. Ez Texting strongly  encourages you to make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate  before proceeding with any online or off-line transaction with any of these  third parties. </p>
    <p class="body-text"><strong>7. Data Security </strong><br>
            The importance of security for all personally-identifiable information  associated with visitors to the Website—as well as Ez Texting customer  information, such as cell phone numbers, texts, messages and other account  data—is of utmost concern to Ez Texting, and we have implemented, and  periodically review, certain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to  help prevent unauthorized access and maintain data security. Unfortunately, due  to the open nature of Internet communications, no data transmission over the  Internet can be guaranteed to be secure, and thus we cannot guarantee that  communications between you and Ez Texting will be free from unauthorized access  by third parties. Visitors of the Website and Ez Texting customers use the  Website at their own risk.</p>
    <p class="body-text"><strong>8. Your Acceptance of These Terms </strong><br>
            By accessing the Website, you signify your assent to the Ez Texting Privacy  Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access the  Website. You should visit this page periodically, as we may, from time to time,  update this Privacy Policy and such changes shall be effectively immediately  upon posting on the Website and without further notice to you.&nbsp; Your  continued access to the Website following the posting of changes to this  Privacy Policy shall be deemed an acceptance of such changes by you.&nbsp; Ez  Texting will, however, use personally-identifiable information only in  accordance with the version of the Privacy Policy under which the information  was collected. <br>
        </p>
