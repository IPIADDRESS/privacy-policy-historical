    <blockquote>
      <p>Thank you for visiting our site at <a href="http://www.eztexting.com/">www.eztexting.com</a> ("<u>Website</u>").&nbsp; Use and access of this Website is subject to  the terms and conditions as set out in our <a href="tou.html">Terms of Service</a> as well as our  Privacy Policy set forth below.</p>
      <p><strong>1. General.</strong><br>
        Your privacy is important to us and we provide this notice explaining  our online information practices and the choices you can make about the  collection and use of the personal information you submit at this Website.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>If you are visiting the Website from outside the United States, please  be advised that your personal data will be processed by Club Texting in the  United States where data protection and privacy regulations may differ from  similar regulations in other countries.&nbsp;  By using the Website, you consent to any such transfer of information  outside of your country if you are located outside of the United States.&nbsp; Additionally, by using the Website, you  consent to Ez Texting using your personal information to contact you  electronically, in writing, or otherwise to provide notices relating to your  use of the Website and to give you information about the products and services  offered by Ez Texting and its affiliates.&nbsp;  If you would like to opt out of future promotional materials from us,  you may indicate this preference by following the unsubscribe instructions at  the end of such communications from us.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Personally-Identifiable Information </strong><br>
        In order to purchase products or services from Ez  Texting, we require that you provide us with certain personally identifiable  information (please see our <u>Terms of Service</u> for additional details). The types of personally identifiable information that  may be collected by Ez Texting through the Website include, without limitation:  name, address, e-mail address, cell phone number and MSISDN (mobile station  integrated services digital network number), credit card and billing  information, download history, customer generated content and/or information about  your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.&nbsp; Ez Texting will not collect any  personally-identifiable information about you unless you provide it to us  voluntarily. </p>
      <p>We may use such  personally identifiable information to provide the services that you have  requested, to contact you about programs, products, features or services in  which we believe you may be interested (such as future promotional materials),  or for other purposes disclosed from time to time.&nbsp; We also may use your personally identifiable  information to contact you regarding your use of our Website or changes to our  Privacy Policy, <u>Terms of Service</u>, or other policies or terms that affect you and your use  of our Website and services. In addition, we may use information collected  about our users to improve the content and navigation of our Website, or for  other internal purposes.</p>
      <p>We may, from time to  time, supplement the information we collect from you with outside records  (e.g., information we obtain from other companies, including wireless  providers) to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you,  and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe  may be of interest to you.</p>
      <p>To fulfill your  requests for products and services, we may share the personally identifiable  information you provide with your cell phone service provider or their partner  and subcontractor companies.&nbsp; Please know  that this Privacy Policy does not cover such entities use of information. To  learn more about your providerâ€™s privacy practices, you should consult its  privacy policy. </p>
      <p>In addition, we may  disclose personally identifiable information collected about you in the  following instances:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legal Action:</strong> We may disclose information about our users, including  personally identifiable information; (i) when requested by governmental or  quasi-governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (ii) if required to  do so by subpoena, court order or legal process;  (iii) to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Website  and applicable laws; or (iv) to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of  our Website. We also may disclose user information whenever we believe  disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability; to protect or defend our  rights or property; or protect the safety, rights, or property of our users.<br>
          <strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change in Control:</strong> We may sell, transfer, or otherwise disclose user  information, including personally identifiable information, to a successor  entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of  substantially all assets, or other corporate change respecting Ez Texting, the  Website and/or the services offered hereby.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Except as stated in  this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise stated at the time personally-identifiable  information is gathered, Ez Texting will not provide personally-identifiable  information to third parties who are not under the direction and control of Ez  Texting. </p>
      <p><strong>3. Cookies</strong><br>
        To enhance your  experience with our site, we may use "cookies" on our Website.  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard  drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser  and to provide features. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail  address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to  provide this information to us by, for example, registering at our Website.  However, once you become a Customer and furnish the site with personally  identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in  the cookie.</p>
      <p>We use cookies to  understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our Website.  For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Website  (e.g., to recognize you when you return to our site). With most internet  browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all  cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please consult the  "Help" section of your browser for more information. However, certain  areas of our site can be accessed only in conjunction with cookies or similar  devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might  prevent you from accessing some of our content.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Children </strong><br>
        The Website is not  directed at individuals less than thirteen (13) years of age, and Ez Texting  does not intend to collect any personally-identifiable information from such  individuals, unless otherwise stated at the time such information is collected. </p>
      <p><strong>5. Information Collected Automatically </strong><br>
        Ez Texting may also (i) automatically collect  non-personally-identifiable information about your use of the Website, such as  the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, Comcast.net, if you  are connecting from a Comcast account), the date and time you access the  Website, and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly  to our Website; and (ii) use data capture and analysis tools, and other similar  tools, to extract, compile and analyze any non-personally identifiable data or  information resulting from your use of the Website and the services offered  thereon (collectively â€œ<u>Blind Data</u>?).&nbsp;  To the extent that any Blind Data is collected by Ez Texting, such Blind  Data shall be solely owned by Ez Texting and may be used by Ez Texting for any  lawful business purpose, including, without limitation, analyzing and enhancing  the Website and services offered hereby, disclosing such Blind Data to third parties for a variety of purposes.</p>
      <p><strong>6. Links to Other Websites </strong><br>
        The Website may  contain links to third party websites, whose information practices may be  different than Ez Textingâ€™s. Visitors should consult such third-party sitesâ€™  privacy notices as Ez Texting does not have any control over information that  is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.&nbsp; Ez Texting does not make any representations  or warranties as to the security of any information (including, without  limitation, credit card and other personal information) you might be requested  to give any third party.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>These links are  provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by Ez Texting  of the contents on such third-party websites.&nbsp;  Ez Texting cannot ensure that you will be satisfied with any products or  services that you purchase from a third-party site that links to or from the  Website, since these sites are owned and operated by independent retailers.</p>
      <p>Ez Texting is not  responsible for the content of linked third-party sites and does not make any  representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials on such  third-party sites.&nbsp; Ez Texting has not  taken any steps to confirm the accuracy or reliability of any of the  information contained in such third-party sites.&nbsp; If you decide to access linked third-party  sites, you do so at you own risk. Ez Texting strongly encourages you to make  whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with  any online or off-line transaction with any of these third parties. </p>
      <p><strong>7. Data Security </strong><br>
        The importance of  security for all personally-identifiable information associated with visitors  to the Website is of utmost concern to Ez Texting, and we have implemented, and  periodically review, certain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to  help prevent unauthorized access and maintain data security. Unfortunately, due  to the open nature of Internet communications, no data transmission over the  Internet can be guaranteed to be secure, and thus we cannot guarantee that  communications between you and Ez Texting will be free from unauthorized access  by third parties. Visitors of the Website and Customers use the site at their  own risk.</p>
      <p><strong>8. Your Acceptance of These Terms </strong><br>
        By accessing the  Website, you signify your assent to the Ez Texting Privacy Policy. If you do  not agree to this Policy, please do not access the Website. You should visit  this page periodically, as we may, from time to time, update this Privacy  Policy and such changes shall be effectively immediately upon posting on the  Website and without further notice to you.&nbsp;  Your continued access to the Website following the posting of changes to  this Privacy Policy shall be deemed an acceptance of such changes by you.&nbsp; Ez Texting will, however, use  personally-identifiable information only in accordance with the version of the  Privacy Policy under which the information was collected. </p>
