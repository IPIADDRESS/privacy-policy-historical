                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
              <p>At eZanga.com, we are committed to protecting online user  privacy. This "Privacy Policy" discloses the privacy practices  governing our knowing collection, use, and disclosure of information. In order  to ensure your privacy, information we collect is used only in the manner and  for the purposes described below. <br>
                <br>
                <u>Anonymous User Information</u>: eZanga.com collects some anonymous  information each time you visit eZanga.com so we can improve the overall  quality of your online experience. We collect your IP address, referral data,  and browser and platform type. You do not have to register with eZanga.com  before we can collect this anonymous information. We do not collect any unique  information about you (such as your name, e-mail address, etc.) except when you  specifically and knowingly provide such information. eZanga.com does not  require you to share information that identifies you personally, such as your  name or email address, in order for you to use the eZanga.com search.  eZanga.com assigns an anonymous ID number to your requests and links the  following additional data to that number: the date and time you visited  eZanga.com, your search terms, and the links upon which you choose to click.  Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files to collect and store this  anonymous user information. We analyze this information to examine trends, administer  the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic  information for aggregate use. eZanga.com may present links in a format that  enables us to understand whether they have been followed. We use this  information to understand and improve the quality of the eZanga.com search. <br>
                <br>
                <u>Cookies</u>: We use a feature of Internet web browsers called a  "cookie," which is a small file that is sent to your computer when  you visit a website. This enables us to store user preferences and track user  trends and search patterns. We use cookies to improve the quality of the  eZanga.com services and to better understand how users interact with us. We do  not and cannot use Cookies to retrieve individual personally identifiable  information about you from your computer unless you knowingly and willingly  provided such information. The cookie technology we use cannot obtain  information from your hard drive or pass on a computer virus. You can reset  your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, some eZanga.com features or services, including our giveaway program,  may not function properly without cookies. <br>
                <br>
                <u>Information security</u>: We take appropriate security measures to protect  against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or  destruction of data. We restrict access to your personally identifying  information to employees who need to know that information in order to operate,  develop or improve our services. <br>
                <br>
                <u>Aggregated General Information</u>: We may share aggregated general  information about our site with our corporate partners or others. Examples of  this include the number of users who searched for "Classic Cars", the  daily number of unique visitors, or how many users clicked on a particular  advertisement. Aggregated data does not contain any personally identifiable  information that could be used to contact or identify you. <br>
