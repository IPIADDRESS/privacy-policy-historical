			<h1><span class="blue_text">PRIVACY</span> <span class="orange_text">POLICY</span></h1>

			<p class="normal_text">Ezweb123.com has all data managed by SiteMaker Software Ltd who are our data controllers. The team at SiteMaker Software Ltd regards your privacy as very important. As required by the UK Data Protection Act 1998, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of all information that you give us.</p>

			<p class="normal_text">This statement describes the privacy policies of SiteMaker Software Ltd. We will not sell, share, rent or otherwise disclose your information to others in ways different to how they are disclosed in this statement.</p>

			<p class="normal_text"><span class="bold">What information do we collect and how do we use it?</span></p>

			<p class="normal_text"><span class="bold">Email Address:</span><br>
			When you first register with us, we ask for your email address. Your email address is used to communicate important information about your account, such as payments due or to reset your password. In addition, if you have chosen to remain part of our mailing list, we send you our newsletter, and/or offers and promotions from ourselves or our carefully selected partners about products or services that are relevant to you. At the end of our newsletters or offers, we always provide you with the opportunity to remove yourself from our mailing list. Additionally, you may opt in or out of either of these types of mailing from any site by clicking My Details from the control bar of any site to which you are logged in, and select Edit my Details. Where your email address has been shared with one of our partners, they are also bound by the terms of this privacy policy and any communications from them will include instructions on how to be removed from their list.</p>
			
			<p class="normal_text">If you choose to become a member of one our customers' sites, you are agreeing to disclose your email address to that site leader. Through SiteMaker, a site leader can choose to mail individual members, groups of members or the entire membership of the site. When you join, you can choose to not be part of the mailing list, and in addition you can always choose to remove yourself from the mailing list of a site by using the unsubscribe function at the end of every email sent from the SiteMaker system.</p>
			<p class="normal_text">If you are logged in to any site, and choose to post information, your posting will by default also include your email address. You are able to remove or edit this address before you submit your posting. In addition, you may choose to be notified by our system of replies or updates in which case your email address will again be used.
			
			
			
			</p><p class="normal_text">If you build a site with us, you provide a site email address that is published on your site as a way of contacting the site owner. This defaults to your email address, but can be updated through Manage your site.</p>
                        
						<p class="normal_text"><span class="bold">Personal Information, Browser Details and Login Times</span></p>

						<p class="normal_text">Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer.
