      <h4>Contractual obligations</h4>
      <p>When you purchase a service, we need to collect personal data to fulfill our legal contractual obligation, for example: so we can manage and invoice your account and contact you for technical support purposes.</p>
      <h4>Legal compliance</h4>
      <p>The law requires we collect and process data for certain purposes such as for keeping financial records (i.e. invoicing) and that we can comply with law enforcement requests for data.</p>

      <h3>10. How long we keep personal data</h3>
      <p>Your data will be kept until it is no longer required for the purpose of its collection.</p>
      <p>At the end of the retention period the data will either be deleted or anonymised so it can no longer be linked back to an individual.</p>
