On some pages, 									you can order products, make requests, and 									register to receive materials or make use of 									our private forums. The types of personal 									information collected at these pages may be 									any or all of the following: <br>									<br>									Name<br>									Address<br>									Phone Number<br>									Email Address<br>									IP Address (required for use on our private 									forum)<br>									Credit/Debit Card Information<br>									<br>									<br>									The credit and payment services we utilize 									to process your order have their own privacy 									statements which may be different from those 									found here at www.EzPowerAds.com It is 									therefore recommended that you carefully 									read the privacy statements located on these 									other sites to help protect your privacy.									<br>									<br>									<b>How We Use Your Information</b> <br>									<br>									We use the information you provide about 									yourself when placing an order only to 									complete that order.

Information you 									submit on our website will not be used for 									this purpose unless you fill out the 									registration form. <br>									<br>									We use non-identifying and aggregate 									information to better design our website and 									to share with advertisers. For example, we 									may tell an advertiser that X number of 									individuals visited a certain area on our 									website, or that Y number of men and Z 									number of women filled out our registration 									form, but we would not disclose anything 									that could be used to identify those 									individuals. <br>									<br>									Finally, we never use or share the 									personally identifiable information provided 									to us online in ways unrelated to the ones 									described above without also providing you 									an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise 									prohibit such unrelated uses. <br>									<br>									<b>Our Commitment to Your Data Security</b>									<br>									<br>									To prevent unauthorized access, maintain 									data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of 									information, we have put in place 									appropriate physical, electronic, and 									managerial procedures to safeguard and 									secure the information we collect online.									<br>									<br>									<b>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</b>									<br>									<br>									Protecting the privacy of the very young is 									especially important to us at 									www.EzPowerAds.com And for that reason, we 									never collect or maintain information at our 									website from those we actually know are 									under the age of 13. No part of our website 									is structured to attract anyone under the 									age of 13. <br>									<br>									Also, if we hear of, are informed of, or are 									witness to any illegal activity with, to, or 									directed at children, we will promptly 									report such parties to the proper 									authorities for prosecution.</span></font><span style="font-size: 11pt">									</span></p></td>								</tr>							</tbody></table>							</td>						</tr>					</tbody></table>					</td>				</tr>			</tbody></table>		</div>
