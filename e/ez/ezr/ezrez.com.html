		<div class="title">Information Collected</div>
		 When you reserve or purchase travel services through EzRez Software, information about you is provided to the airline, car rental agency, hotel or other involved third party to ensure the successful fulfillment of your travel arrangements. This information is stored or archived in our reservation systems beyond travel completion date, for accounting purposes and internal historical reporting. Like most websites and service providers, EzRez Software collects non-personally identifiable 'clicks-stream' data sent by web browsers. This data includes Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, requested web page, referring web page, platform type, and the date/time stamp of a web page request. EzRez Software does not link your IP address or any other click-stream data to your personally identifiable information. This information is used only for the diagnosis of system problems, and internal technical demographics reporting. Cookies are pieces of information that a site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and EzRez Software uses them to provide useful features [please describe features]for its members. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. EzRez Software uses both session cookies, which exist only while a web browser remains open and persistent cookies, which exist permanently on a user's hard drive. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer to set yours to refuse cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of the EzRez Software website. 
		<br><br>
		<div class="title">Information Disclosure</div>
		EzRez Software provides personally identifiable information provided by you to third party suppliers, intermediaries, and affiliates, as needed to fulfill your travel arrangements. We have not placed limitations on these suppliers from using or disclosing your information without your permission. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any travel suppliers whose products you purchase through EzRez Software's website since your personally identifiable information will be governed by such policies, not by our policy. In addition to the circumstances described above, EzRez Software may disclose customer information if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other government or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable including, without limitation, to protect the rights or properties of EzRez Software when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities. Please be aware that EzRez Software contains links to other web sites that may collect personally identifiable information about you. When you click on one of these links, you are entering another web site for which EzRez Software has no responsibility. Furthermore, this Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices or policies of such web sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all such sites, as their policies may be materially different from EzRez Software's Privacy Policy.

		<div class="title">Information Safeguards</div>
		All personally identifiable information you provide to EzRez Software is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven cryptographic system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us.
		In addition, EzRez Software employs cryptographic technologies to safeguard all personally identifiable information which is permanently stored by our systems.  EzRez Software maintains strict physical and logical access controls to protect the sensitive data stored in our systems.
		You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information. Please be very careful, responsible, and alert with this information, especially whenever you're online.
		<br><br>
		<div class="title">Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Access to Personal Information</div>
		If a customer's personally identifiable information changes, or if a customer no longer desires our services, we provide a way to correct, update, or delete information stored in our system about that customer.  Customers who wish to view, modify, or remove information about themselves stored on our systems may contact our Customer Support department by email, telephone, or postal mail, using the contact information listed below.
		<br><br>
		<div class="title">Notification of Material Changes</div>
		If we decide to make any material change to our Privacy Statement, we will post those changes to this Privacy Statement, our corporate website, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  We will use information in accordance with the Privacy Statement under which the information was collected. 
		If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.  However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner.  In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our website notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
