<p><b>Use of Cookies</b></p>
<p>Our site makes use of cookies when a visitor's Internet browser is set up to accept them. Cookies are small data files that our web site sends to your browser for storage on your computer's hard drive.

<p><b>Use of Information</b></p>
<p>We use your personally identifying information to identify you as a user of the site and to assist and speed the completion of transactions on the site. We may use your email address to contact you directly regarding services or products that we believe may be of interest to you. We may also associate your personally identifying information with information we collect about your preferences and activities at the site, such as the particular pages you request at the site and purchases or other transactions you effect through the site. We may vary the content you receive in future visits to the site based on your preferences and activities.</p>
<p>We may combine your personally identifying information, and information about your preferences and activities, with those of all or a particular group of our users to prepare collective profiles of our users and their activities. For example, we may track the number of our users who view certain pages or use certain features or compile the total dollar amount of sales conducted through our site in a particular geographic region. Such information, and other information we derive from individual users' information, allows us to continue to grow and provide you with quality fellow users through more accurate marketing and advertising of our Web site.</p>
<p><b>Third Party Disclosure</b></p>
<p>The personal information you have provided us and information about your order may be shared with third parties.

<p>WE WILL NEVER provide them any information about your credit cards.</p>
<p>Finally, we may disclose information to fulfill certain legal and regulatory requirements or if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect others' rights or to prevent harm.</p>
<p><b>Choice</b></p>
<p>You may choose to restrict our use of your information to maintaining your account on the site, or prohibit our disclosure of your information to others, by contacting us and directing us to impose such limits. For example, if requested, we will not provide your information to any third parties, regardless of the steps they may take to protect such information. If you do not wish us to provide your information to third parties, or otherwise wish us to restrict the use or disclosure of your information, please access the "Your Account" section of our site and adjust your mailing preferences from the "yes" to the "no" option or send us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:customerservice@eziba.com">customerservice@eziba.com</a>.</p>

To use this protection technology, you need to have an SSL-capable browser, such as Netscape Navigator 4.5 or higher, Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.5 or higher. These browsers will automatically activate the technology when you log on to our site.</p>
<p>Please remember that you play a valuable part in security as well. Your password to access our site, which you select at registration, should never be shared with anyone and should be changed frequently. And, after you have finished using our site, you should log off and exit your browser so no unauthorized persons can use our site with your name and account information. Remember that any information you voluntarily disclose on-line in any news or message postings, discussion groups or chat rooms may be collected and used by others without your permission. Furthermore, if you provide any information to parties who operate Web sites that are linked to or from our site, different rules may apply to their collection, use or disclosure of your personal information. We encourage you to review these sites' policies before revealing any sensitive or personal information.</p>
<p>Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk.</p>
