						<strong>Who we are</strong>
						<p>411num – is a service that aggregates information publicly available online and helps you to find other people and connect with them.</p>
						<p>411num searches the web in real-time for publicly available data linked to names, just in the same manner as Google, Bing or any other web search engine processes general queries.</p>
						<p>This document describes how we treat your personal data and other information about you. If you are looking for the guidance on how to log in to 411num, or wondering what the general rules and restrictions when using this website are, please take a look at our <a href="http://411num.com/terms-of-service">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

						</ul>
						<strong>Information Indexed by 411num</strong>

							<li>openly circulates on the Internet.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You might find information about yourself on the Website. It means that it has been published or released on the Internet by you or with your consent earlier, and 411num is not the source of such publication or release.</p>
						<p>Most of the information that goes through the Website is not stored, collected or otherwise processed by 411num. We work like a search engine that does not generate or produce its own content, information or data. Information found on Search results Pages is the example of such indexing of content and information available on the Internet and connecting various pieces of information.</p>
						<p>At the same time we might collect and store some information, for example to make User pages available as a part of the Website. In case it contains Personal Data we protect it in the same manner we treat Personal Data provided by you directly (please, see Section “Information Provided by Users” further below).</p>
