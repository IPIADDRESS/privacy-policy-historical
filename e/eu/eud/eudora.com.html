          and purchase products. We collect visitors' contact information (like 
          their names and email addresses). In the event the customer is making 
          a purchase, we will also require additional financial and billing information 
          (like credit card, shipping address, telephone, etc.). Contact information 
          from the order form is used to ship orders. Users may opt in and grant

          addresses). With the user's permission, we use contact data from our 
          surveys to send the user information about our company, products and 
          promotional material. If the user chooses to allow us, we may also send

          eliminating personally identifiable information in the process. The

          a newer version is available, Eudora will notify the user and give the 
          user the option to upgrade. The user has the ability to disable the 
          update check at any time. Instructions for disabling this feature can 
          be found at eudora.com for <a href="http://www.eudora.com/techsupport/kb/2111hq.html">Windows</a>

          Information<br>
          </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When a 
          user registers, we collect certain contact information (like email address 
          and first and last name) that will be used to verify the user's eligibility 
          for services and upgrades, provide services like technical support and 
          verify a user's identity in the case of a lost registration code. This 
          information may also be used to contact the user, with their permission.

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Ad-specific Information<br>
          </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order 
          to operate properly, the sponsor-supported version of Eudora 4.3 collects 
          certain information (like current operating system, monitor bit depth 
          and size, version and mode of Eudora, Eudora use time). This information 
          is used to meet our requirements to our sponsors and to serve content 
          that looks good and is appropriate and compatible with users' systems. 
          We also collect data on what ads users currently have on their computer. 
          This is used to manage ad traffic and help tech support and our web 
          administrators to solve any problems. If the software detects a problem 
          with displaying ads, it warns the user. The warning includes a button 
          that can be clicked by the user to ask for the problem to be diagnosed. 
          Should the user specifically ask to have the problem diagnosed, information 
          about failed attempts to receive ads will be transmitted to us. This 
          information is also useful in determining what areas of the program 
          need enhancement. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From time to time, 
          some of Eudora's advertising will only be applicable to certain geographic 
          regions (phone services, insurance providers, etc). In such cases, Eudora 
          will use the user's IP address to send the most appropriate advertising. 
          Many IP addresses are commonly associated with Internet service providers, 
          universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities. 
          The only information used in this procedure is the data about the geographic 
          region from which the user's computer is contacting the Internet. Absolutely 
          no personal information (email address, address of residence, demographics, 
          etc.) is revealed to QUALCOMM or our advertisers in these situations.</font></p>

          us to do so, information on Eudora usage (like features used) and Internet 
          connection time. <b>This does not contain actual data entered by the 
          user. Any identifying information gathered is immediately separated 
          from this information, so that we have no idea whose usage pattern we 
          have. </b></font></p>

          </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When users 
          fill out a demographic profile, a profile ID is generated and sent to 
          the Eudora client software on the user's system. This information is 
          used to serve ads that are more relevant to the user. The user can choose 
          to modify or delete the profile at any time.</font></p>

          at any time, to pay for the software in which case advertising will 
          be removed and a survey is not required. A user in Light mode may switch 
          to Sponsored mode at any time by filling out a profile. This demographic
