<li><a name="agreement"></a><strong>Agreement:</strong>&nbsp;By using the PSLive Service or attending an Event, you (“<strong>User</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>”) agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy as may be amended by us from time to time, save that we will ask you separately, when you provide us with your details whether you consent to receiving promotional communications from: (a) us; and also (b) from third party providers of goods and services with whom we may share your details.&nbsp;<strong>Amendments</strong>: We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Amendment will come into effect immediately upon such change being notified on the&nbsp;<a href="/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PSLive site</span></a>&nbsp;(“<strong>Site</strong>”). We therefore encourage you to visit this Privacy Policy from time to time to make sure that you are aware of the current version and any changes that we may make.&nbsp;</li>

<li><a name="whatinfo"></a><strong>Registration Details:</strong>&nbsp;As part of the process to open a PSLive Account, use of the PSLive System and to allow us to provide our Services to you, we will ask you to provide us with certain personal information, including but not limited to your name, date of birth, email address, country of residence and nationality as well as certification that you are at least 18 years old or older in jurisdictions in which the Event is held where the minimum age for attendance is greater than 18. The name you register with us must be your own name. In addition, it is important that you complete the account details with valid information, since it will be used in the course of verifying your identity and for the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. You must advise us of any relevant changes to your personal information as provided to us and we do not accept liability for any harm that you may suffer as a result of you failing to notify us of any changes to the personal information that you have provided to us.&nbsp;<strong>Data Retention:</strong>&nbsp;We retain your personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy which includes any period of historic retention that may be required for regulatory purposes. We do not collect any more personal information from our users than is necessary for our purposes and our data management policies include the deletion of any personal information we no longer require. Prior to May 25, 2018 (“<strong>GDPR Live Date</strong>”), should you close (or if we shut down) your PSLive Account with us, we will retain your personal data for 5 (five) years from the date of closure in order to assist you with any queries you may raise about your participation in our Events. For account closures made after the GDPR Live Date, we will only retain your personal data for 2 (two) years following account closure. <strong>Purposes:</strong>&nbsp;We, members of our Group of companies, our affiliates and third parties providing services to us or to you on our behalf will use your personal information for the purpose of conducting our business and enabling you to use the PSLive System and/or your attendance and participation at an Event. Specifically, this includes the following purposes, but we also reserve the right to use your personal information for any other purposes that are reasonably ancillary to the business of sponsoring, hosting, administering or organising Events:
<ul>
<li>to confirm financial transactions;</li>
<li>to assess your gambling activity for responsible gaming purposes;</li>
<li>to provide the&nbsp;PSLive Services to you;</li>
<li>identification, verification and vetting purposes;</li>
<li>statistical analysis and research;</li>
<li>research and development;</li>
<li>marketing, market research, customer surveys and customer profiling;</li>
<li>data analysis;</li>
<li>to comply with licensing and regulatory requirements;</li>
<li>to combat against security risks and fraudulent activity.</li>

</ol>
<p>^ <a href="/about/privacy/#top">Back to Top</a></p><h2>Conditions for Processing Personal Information</h2><ol start="3">
<li><a name="conditions"></a><strong>Conditions: </strong>We will process your personal information for a variety of reasons, each of which is prescribed by relevant data protection laws.&nbsp;
<p><strong>Consent</strong><br><br>Our processing of your personal information will primarily be necessary for us to provide you with the services. On occasion we may ask for your consent to processing personal information in a discrete manner, in this instance your personal information will be processed in accordance with such consent and you will be able to withdraw this consent in writing at any time. By way of example, your consent will be needed in order to send you marketing and promotional communications.</p>
<p><strong>Fulfilment of a contract, compliance with a legal obligation.</strong></p>
<p>It may also be necessary for us to process your personal information where it is necessary for the performance of a contract (such as the&nbsp;<a href="/about/tos/">PokerStars Live Terms and Conditions</a>) or in order for us to comply with our various legal and/or regulatory responsibilities, including, but not limited to, complying with the conditions of applicable gaming licences (whether held by us or some other third party in whose venue the Event is held) and complying with any anti-money laundering legislation.<br><br><strong>Legitimate interests</strong></p>
Finally, we may also process your personal information where we deem such processing to be in our (or a third party's) legitimate interests and provided always that such processing will not prejudice your interests, rights and freedoms.
