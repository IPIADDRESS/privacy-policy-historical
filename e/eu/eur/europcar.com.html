		<!----------------------   Terms2   ----------------------------->
		<p class="subreg"><a name="Terms2">Protection of Personal Data on the Europcar Site</a></p>
		<p class="regtxt">Europcar, its subsidiaries and franchisees consider it necessary to offer their customers and visitors to the site (hereinafter "Customers") full information regarding the manner in which it collects and uses the information obtained on the site accessible at the address www.europcar.com (hereinafter the "Site"). That disclosure, desired by Europcar, is intended to enable Customers to provide information relating to themselves with full awareness and security. </p>
		<p class="regtxt">For such purpose, and in order to comply with its obligations in France under laws and regulations, the Site has been reported to the national "Computers and Civil Liberties" commission in order to comply with the provisions of French law 78-17 dated January 6, 1978. Europcar undertakes, in all countries where legislation and regulations of this kind are applicable, to secure compliance with the provisions protecting privacy and personal data. </p>
		<p class="regtxt">The personal data are collected first in order to enable Europcar better to know its Customers and serve them, in particular as regards the on-line vehicle-reservation programs and frequent-user programs (Cards, Europoints, etc.), and to set up promotional offers in order better to meet its Customers' expectations.</p>
		<p class="regtxt">In this respect, Europcar undertakes that :<br>
		(I)no information will be collected without its Customers' knowledge;<br>
		(II)no personal information will be used otherwise than as stated.</p>
		<p class="regtxt">When such personal data are requested and collected on the Site, the Customers are reminded of the manner in which they may have access to, correct or remove such information, and the person with whom that right of access, correction or removal may be exercised. Europcar checks, before allowing anyone access to those personal data, the identity of the person requesting it. </p>
		<p class="regtxt">The information collected by Europcar regarding its Customers is so obtained in various ways, including in particular, but not only, through the Site or the websites of its subsidiaries and franchisees, but also through the on-line reservation service or through membership of the Europoints program or any frequent-user card program insofar as name, forename, address, telephone and fax number, date of birth, driver's license number, e-mail address, credit-card information, etc. may be requested and retained.  In addition, in some cases, Europcar's site may transmit programs for the collection of personal information (cookies, capture of environmental variables, management of auditing files and opening of the directory of cached Internet temporary files), recorded on the Customer's or visitor's computer, allowing him or her to be recognized when visiting the Site or a Europcar subsidiary or franchisee's site again. Upon each creation and transmission of such cookies containing personal information, a choice to accept or refuse that transmission of cookies will be offered. In addition, the visitor to the site will be informed that he or she may also refuse all cookies or choose case by case, by changing the parameters of the browser used.</p>
		<p class="regtxt">Last, Europcar may also obtain and collect personal information from some of its trading partners. Such information also shall be used in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations. </p>
		<p class="regtxt">By using this Site, the Customer expressly permits Europcar to use the information provided to it, and to forward it to its subsidiaries and franchisees, companies affiliated to its group, and trading partners. At the time of each collection of information, Europcar will ask the Customer to confirm his or her consent to use of the information so collected, and remind him or her of his or her rights under the applicable legislation. </p>
		<p class="regtxt">In all cases, Europcar's Customers will be given an opportunity to grant Europcar permission to make limited use of the data collected, by (I) prohibiting Europcar from forwarding those personal data to other companies not affiliated to the Europcar group (subsidiaries andfranchisees), or (II) prohibiting Europcar from using those data for promotional purposes (sending of advertising, direct mail, etc.). <a href="#top"><img src="/images/bt_top.gif" width="19" height="22" border="0" align="right"></a><br><br></p>

		<p class="regtxt">No information contained in this Site may be treated as an offer or invitation to treat, apart from the pages containing specific services and for which contract offers are presented expressly and unambiguously.

		<p class="regtxt"><b>Liability </b></p>
		<p class="regtxt">In no event shall Europcar bear any liability directly or indirectly to anyone owing to use of this Site, including in the event that Europcar or one of its representatives has been informed of a risk. If the governing law does not allow a disclaimer of liability, Europcar's liability shall be limited in all cases to the extent permitted by the governing law.</p>
		<p class="regtxt"><b>Warranty </b></p>
		<p class="regtxt">Europcar shall use best efforts to ascertain the accuracy of the information published on the Site, the contents of which it reserves the right to amend at any time without notice. </p>
		<p class="regtxt">However, the information contained in this Site is provided without any warranty of any kind whatsoever, express or implied, on Europcar's part.

		<p class="regtxt">Europcar shall bear no liability pursuant to the reservation or reservation-simulation service available on the site and all the official Europcar sites. The terms and conditions of reservation and rental of Europcar vehicles are subject to amendment at any time. The Europcar on-line vehicle-rental service shall not give rise to any liability of Europcar, in tort or contract, directly or indirectly. The pricing information provided by the on-line reservation service is information based on the data provided by the Customer. In no event shall on-line reservation of a Europcar vehicle be treated as constituting a rental contract. Each official Europcar site contains a reminder, in the language of the Customers at which it is directed, and according to the statutes and regulations in force in the country where the services will be provided, of the terms of reservation and rental of Europcar vehicles. Those terms shall be notified to the Customer on request. If that warning does not appear on the official site, the Customer shall be deemed to have received sufficient information from this caution.</p>
		<p class="regtxt">In any event, the vehicle-rental contract shall be formed only at the time when the Customer withdraws his or her vehicle and signs the rental contract, accepting the rental terms contained in it. These provisions shall not apply pursuant to the option in the Ready Master Rental Agreement.<br><br> <a href="#top"><img src="/images/bt_top.gif" width="19" height="22" border="0" align="right"></a><br><br>&nbsp;</p>

			<li class="regtxt">Normal maintenance, oil and lubrication are included in the rates. Incurred roadside expenses which have been approved by a Europcar station will be refunded upon presentation of the original receipts. </li>
		</ul>
		<p class="regtxt">In most cases, Europcar rates are daily rates where a day is considered as 24 hours, counted from the time the rental starts.<br><br>  
		If you return the car late, your rate will be recalculated, adding an extra day for each additional 24 hours you have kept the car.  So if you planned to keep the car for 5 days, then keep it for 7, you will be charged the price for a 7 day rental when you return the vehicle.  Each 24 hour period started counts as a whole rental day.  However, if you return the car late, but within the planned 24 hour period, there will be no extra charge.  In fact – Europcar offers you 30 minutes grace period after the 24 hours are up, just to give you a bit more time.  So a rental of 24 hours and 30 minutes still counts as a one day rental.<br><br>  
		<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Remember that your insurances only cover you for the period mentioned on the Rental Agreement you made when you picked up the car.  So if you decide to return the car later than first planned, please drop into the rental station (or call) to amend the Rental Agreement.</p>
