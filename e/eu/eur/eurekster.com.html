<br>
								Like you, we hate the thought of someone misusing personal information. 
												Here are our key promises to you:</p>
								
                  <ol>
                    <li>We never provide your email address or other Personally 
                      Identifiable Information to anyone not described in this 
                      Privacy Policy unless you have given us permission. 
                    </li><li>We will do all we can to protect your identity so you 
                      are not contacted by people you don't want to contact you 
                      due to your joining eurekster. 
                    </li><li>If you decide at any time to unsubscribe from eurekster, 
                      your connections to the rest of your network are removed, 
                      and we will not contact you again. </li>
                    <li>eurekster uses the RealContacts Networking Service to 
                      provide its socially networked search service. The <a href="http://jobs.realcontacts.com/privacypolicy.asp" onclick="popupwindow(this.href,'RCPrivacyPolicy');return false;" target="_blank">RealContacts 
                      Privacy Policy</a> applies to the information that You and 
                      We share with RealContacts and is incorporated and included 
                      here (hotlink) by reference.</li>
                  </ol>
								<p><span class="SectionTitle">The information we collect</span><br>
												If you just browse 
											our
												web site or use our search service and do not sign-up for the eurekster 
												service, we will only collect anonymous information from you, such as 
												tracking the web pages you visit, to help us improve the service.</p>
								<p>If you sign-up for the service, we will collect Personally Identifiable 
												Information from you such as your email address and contact details. Existing 
												eurekster members may invite you to join the service; if so, they will 
												enter your email address in the service and send you an email invitation. 
												We will retain this 3rd party Personally Identifiable Information in that 
												case only to track and match the invitation to you if you decide to visit 
												our web site and accept the invitation. </p>
								<p>We collect three types of information from you:<br>
								- Personally Identifiable Information that you submit 
											to us when you sign-up for the service or when you use the service. Your 
											Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies or can 
											be
												used to identify, contact, or locate you, or from which your identification 
												or contact information can be derived. Examples include your name, email address, 
												telephone number, etc. Note that if you enter Personally Identifiable Information 
												in your “eurekster Search” terms or on other websites, that information will 
												be visible to others in the displayed list of searches or 
												websites.<br>
												- Passively Collected Personally Identifiable Information that we create 
												in the form of statistics and logs. This information may be linked to 
												your Personally Identifiable Information that you submit to us in order 
												to track, improve, and personalize the service for you. Examples include 
												Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider 
												(ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number 
												of clicks. <br>
												- Anonymous information, meaning information from which your Personally 
												Identifiable Information cannot be extracted or deduced. An example is 
												statistics on how often users visit the various web pages.</p>
								<p>We do not collect or match information about you from other sources, 
												such as public records or bodies, or private organizations.</p>
								<p>We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

								<p><span class="SectionTitle">What the information is used for</span><br>
												You may choose to make some of your Personally Identifiable Information 
												and other information visible to other users in your network of contacts 
												on eurekster, or possibly beyond. This is necessary for the operation 
												of some parts of the service, and is under your control. An example of information you may choose to disclose is your email address when you send invitations to others to join eurekster. </p>
								<ul>
												
								<li>We use your Personally Identifiable Information and Anonymous Information 
													for the following purposes:</li>
								<li> Operation of the service</li>
								<li> Technical administration of the web site</li>
								<li> Research and Development, to improve the services and develop new 
													ones</li>
								<li> Customer support and administration</li>
								<li> Marketing, but only to market specific new eurekster services 
													and features to you, through the use of emails and newsletters. You 
													can request not to receive such communication ("opt-out"), 
													by changing your notification preferences under "My Account," 
													after logging on.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><span class="SectionTitle">Disclosure of your information</span><br>
												This section describes the circumstances in which we disclose your information 
												to others.</p>
								<p>Our services are hosted by Hosting and Internet Service Providers. The 
												information we collect from you is collected and stored on their systems, 
												on our behalf. They have agreed to not use your information for any other 
												purpose and to not disclose your information to any 3rd party.</p>
								<p>We may have other sub-contractors or business partners who assist with the hosting 
												and/or operation of the services and customer support. We may share your Personally Identifiable 
												Information with them in order to operate and improve the service, but 
												they will be bound by this Privacy Policy to not use or disclose your 
												information for any other purpose. An example sub-contractor could be 
												a Licensed Credit Reference and Financial Agency, who we would engage 
												only if your use of the service requires payment or credit authentication 
												and processing.</p>
								<p>If eurekster establishes corporate presence in other countries or 
												creates other business units to provide more efficient service, we would 
												share your information with these new entities. They will protect your 
												information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>
								<p>We have independent business partners who run complementary services to eurekster. 
												We will share your Personally Identifiable Information with them only 
												upon your specific "opt-in" approval, in order for the complementary 
												services to operate. </p>
								<p>We may disclose your information to a company or individual that acquires 
												part or all of our assets or company, but we would require them to either 
												honour this privacy policy or else inform you under the "what's new" 
												section of our web site that changes have occurred, and give you the opportunity 
												to decide whether to accept them or unsubscribe from the service.</p>
								<p>We will disclose your address and contact details to postal, courier, 
												or other companies in order to deliver you material that you have specifically 
												requested or indicated willingness to receive.</p>
								<p>We may share anonymous information with others at our discretion, but 
												your Personally Identifiable Information cannot be extracted from this 
												information.</p>
								<p>We may disclose your personal information if we believe the law requires 
												us to do so, in order to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order, 
												or legal process served on us.</p>
								<p>We do not trade in your Personally Identifiable Information with any 
												other person or organization not mentioned above without your specific 
												permission.</p>
								<p><span class="SectionTitle">Our use of Cookies</span><br>
												A "cookie" is a small data file transferred by our web site 
												to your computer's hard drive. We send cookies when you visit our web 
												site or use the service. Accepting the cookies used on our site does not 
												give us access to information on your computer other than the cookie itself, 
												but we may use the cookies to identify your computer. </p>
								<p>Many cookies are "session" cookies, meaning the cookie does 
												not stay on your computer after you leave our web site or close your browser. 
												Cookies that remain on your computer are called "permanent" 
												cookies. </p>
								<p>Our only use of cookies is an optional permanent cookie that makes it 
												easier for you to login to the eurekster site, or if you are not logged-in, to remember your preferences for SearchGroups and other non-logged in services. If you check "remember 
												my settings on this computer" when you sign up or login, we create 
												a cookie on that computer which will identify you and pre-fill the login 
												details when you return to the site. </p>
								<p>We urge you to not check "remember my settings on this computer" 
												when logging-in on a computer that is not yours or that you share with 
												others. If you have previously set this on a computer, you can remove 
												the cookie by logging-off and then logging in again with the "remember 
												my settings" box unchecked.</p>
								<p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually refuse 
												cookies or selectively accept certain cookies by adjusting the preferences 
												in your browser.<br>
											</p>
								<p><span class="SectionTitle">Use of the Internet to transfer information</span><br>
												When you send or retrieve information from our web site, the information 
												will travel over the Internet, perhaps even internationally. The security 
												and safety of your information while in transit is outside our control. 
											</p>
								<p><span class="SectionTitle">The European Union Data Protection Directive</span><br>
												If you reside in the European Union (EU) or if any transfer of information 
												between you and the Services is governed by the European Union Data Protection 
												Directive or national laws implementing that Directive, then you consent 
												to the transfer of such information within and outside of the European 
												Union to countries as required by the current and future Services, subject 
												to this Privacy Policy.</p>
								<p><span class="SectionTitle">Retention of your information</span><br>
												If you are a member, we will retain your Personally Identifiable Information 
												for as long as you are a member of eurekster. If you unsubscribe from 
												the service, we reserve the right but not the obligation to delete your 
												information from our records.</p>
								<p><span class="SectionTitle">Accessing, correcting, updating, or removing 
												your information </span><br>
												If you wish to access, correct, update, or remove your Personally Identifiable 
												Information that you submitted to us, you can do so by logging on to eurekster 
												and selecting "Manage My Account". If you submitted the information as part of a service, such as setting up a SearchGroup, you can directly edit the information in the relevant service area of the web site.</p>
								<p>You can also ask us if we keep personal data on you by sending us an 
												email at <a href="mailto:privacy@eurekster.com">privacy@eurekster.com</a>.</p>
								<p>If you contact us, we will send you an email to your preferred email 
												address on your account and you must reply to that email before we take 
												action on your account. This is for your protection, to validate that 
												someone else is not trying to access or modify your information. If your 
												preferred email address is no longer valid, you must login to the service 
												and modify the email address. If your preferred email address is no longer 
												valid and you do not recall your password, you can request by clicking 
												on "?" by the login box that you password be sent to any alternate 
												email addresses you have configured on your account. If you have no valid 
												alternate email addresses on your account, you can contact us by email 
												from another email address to explain and give as many details as you 
												can recall of your contacts and account settings. At our discretion, we 
												may assist you with reactivating the account, but it is likely we will 
												request that you open a new account. </p>
								<p>If you have no account with us, we will reply directly to the email from 
												which you sent your request (note that in this case we hold none of your 
												Personally Identifiable Information).</p>
								<p>We will reply to you by email within one week, at no charge.</p>
								<p>We allow you to challenge the Personally Identifiable Information that 
												we hold about you and, where appropriate and possible, you may have it 
												erased, corrected, or completed.</p>
								<p><span class="SectionTitle">Notification of changes to this Privacy Policy</span><br>
												This Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. If we change it, 
												we will update the "last updated" date at the top of this policy. 
												If we make material changes, we will notify you on the "What's New" 
												section of the web site, that you see on your personalized home page after 
												logging-in. </p>
								<p>If the change is to use your Personally Identifiable Information for 
												new purposes related to the eurekster services within eurekster, 
												our sub-contractors, and current business partners, we offer you these 
												ways to opt-out from those new purposes:<br>
												- You can login to your account at <a href="http://www.eurekster.com" target="_blank">http://www.eurekster.com</a>. 
												This is the fastest and easiest way. In some cases, we may offer you the 
												option to opt-out of the new usage. In all cases you have the option to 
												unsubscribe from the service.<br>
												- by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@eurekster.com">privacy@eurekster.com</a></p>
								<p>If the change is to use your Personally Identifiable Information for 
												a new service with a new business partner, we would inform you specifically 
												about the new service in the "What's New" section of the web 
												site and possibly through our email newsletter, unless you have selected 
												to not receive newsletters. We would only disclose your Personally Identifiable 
												Information to the new business partner if you specifically consent ("opt-in") 
												to the new service.<br>
											</p>
								<p><span class="SectionTitle">Communications from us<br>
												</span>We send you a welcoming email after you sign-up to tell you how 
												to get started with the service. Established members will occasionally 
												receive information on our services, announcements, and a newsletter. 
												Out of respect for your privacy we give you the option to opt-out and 
												not receive many of these types of communications.</p>
								<p>Newsletter:<br>
												By default all users are subscribed to our newsletters. You may choose 
												to not receive them by logging-on and changing your preferences under 
												"My Account."</p>
								<p>Service Announcements:<br>
												On rare occasions it is necessary to send you a strictly service related 
												announcement. For instance, if our service is suspended for maintenance 
												for an extended period we might send you an email. It is not possible 
												for you to opt-out of these communications, although you do have the option 
												to unsubscribe from the service.</p>
								<p>Customer Service:<br>
												We communicate with you to provide services you request and in response 
												to issues with your account. We generally reply by email, but we will 
												reply by phone or by post if circumstances require it.</p>
								<p><span class="SectionTitle">Security <br>
												</span>eurekster will always make every effort to protect your information. 
												When sensitive information is submitted via the web site it is protected 
												both on-line and off-line. </p>
								<p>During any future online payment process, when sensitive information 
												such as your credit card number is entered, we will provide SSL secure 
												encryption service to protect your information. </p>
								<p>When you use a computer other than your own to access eurekster, we 
												urge you to NOT select "remember my settings on this computer" 
												when you log-in, and when you are finished to logout of the site, clear 
												the Internet Browser offline content (or cache), and close the browser 
												session. </p>
								<p>We act to protect your information off-line. Our services operate in 
												a locked environment with access control and intrusion detection. All 
												information relating to you is restricted in our organization. Only those 
												employees and sub-contractors who specifically need the information to 
												perform their job (such as our support team) are given access to Personally 
												Identifiable Information. All employees are obliged to sign our Employee 
												Privacy Agreement, and all sub-contractors have agreed to not use your 
												Personally Identifiable Information for any other purpose and to not disclose 
												it to anyone else. </p>
								<p><span class="SectionTitle">Links<br>
												</span>The web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that 
												we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage 
												you to be aware of this when you leave our site and to read the privacy 
												statements of other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information 
												collected by web sites under the eurekster.com domain. </p>
