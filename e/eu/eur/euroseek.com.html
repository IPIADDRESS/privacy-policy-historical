This statement explains our current information gathering process, which is subject to change without notice. We suggest that you review this Privacy Policy from time to time to update yourself on any such changes.</p>
<p>

<ul class="liststyle6">
	<li>
		Any personally identifiable information collected by EuroSeek.</li>
	<li>
		How such information is used by EuroSeek.</li>

<p>
	<strong><u>Collection and Use of Information</u></strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>Registration: </strong>&nbsp;In order to submit a site, users must first complete our registration form. During this process, users are required to provide contact information, including their name and email address. This information is used to contact users about the services on our site in which they have expressed interest.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Payment: </strong>When a registered user is submitting a site to EuroSeek's directory, information is required on the submission form. Users must provide contact information (name, email, and billing address), and financial information (such as credit card numbers and expiration dates). This information is used for billing purposes, and to contact the user in the event a submission cannot be processed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong><u>Information Use</u></strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>User Profiles: </strong>We retain the information collected through log files and via the information users provide during registration and site submission, in order to create profiles.&nbsp; These profiles are stored data that we maintain on individual users detailing their characteristics. As a result, collected information is tied to users' personally identifiable information in order to improve our customer service and provide offers.<em> User profiles are not shared with third parties. </em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

These files include IP (internet protocol) addresses, ISP (internet service provider) information, browser identification, platform identification, referring and/or exit pages, time/date stamps, and the number of clicks. These logs are used to analyze browsing trends, track users' movements in the aggregate, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use, and administer the site. IP addresses, etc., are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Information Sharing</u></strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>Disclaimer: </strong>While EuroSeek makes every effort to protect user privacy, we may be required by law to disclose information when we have a good-faith belief that such information is necessary in order to be in compliance with a court order, legal process or current judicial proceeding involving our website.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aggregate (Non-personally Identifiable Information): </strong>We share aggregated demographic information with our advertisers and partners.&nbsp; This information includes page views, browser types, unique visitors, and additional broad demographic data. This data is not linked to any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Third-Party Advertisers: </strong>EuroSeek shares site usage data about its users with reputable third-party advertisers. While we make every effort to accept only advertisers who are reputable, and who share our commitment to privacy protection, we cannot be held responsible for the privacy policies of any advertiser, promotional link, sponsor, or any other third party.

<p>
	<strong><u>Situations where EuroSeek Will Share Users' Personal Information: </u></strong></p>
