content relevant to your market. &nbsp;For the use of the Eurostar

allows registered users to be presented with a personalised version of
the site.</p>
<p><strong>Tagging of the Site</strong></p>
<p>Eurostar uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage
online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management
partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a
unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables Eurostar to
learn which advertisements bring users to Eurostar’s website. &nbsp;The
cookie was placed by Eurostar or by another advertiser who works with
DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the
information that Eurostar collects and shares is anonymous and not
personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address,
telephone number, or email address. For more information about
DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these
technologies, go to: <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy">http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy</a> </p>
<p><strong>Security of passenger information</strong></p>
<p>Eurostar stores passenger information in a central database, which
is managed by our administrative staff and authorised agencies and is
accessible electronically. &nbsp;Security measures are in place to
ensure that data can not be accessed by unauthorised persons.
&nbsp;From time to time people such as I.T. systems suppliers may need
to access the system. &nbsp;Eurostar’s security procedures mean that we
may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to
disclose sensitive information to you.</p>

<p><strong>Your Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to see the personal data held on you by Eurostar.
&nbsp;Eurostar will provide this information for the maximum fee
