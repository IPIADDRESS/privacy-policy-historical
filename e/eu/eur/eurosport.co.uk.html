Yahoo! takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy and cookie policy. <p>

</p><p>
<b>What this Privacy and Cookie Policy Covers</b><br>
</p><ul>
  <li>This Privacy Policy covers Yahoo!'s treatment of personally identifiable 
    information that Yahoo! collects when you are on the Yahoo! site, and when 
    you use Yahoo!'s services. This policy also covers Yahoo!'s treatment of any 
    personally identifiable information that Yahoo!'s business partners share 
    with Yahoo!. 
  </li><li>The policy also gives information about cookies; Yahoo! and third parties' 
    use of cookies; and how you may disable such cookies. 
  </li><li>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Yahoo! does 
    not own or control, or to people that Yahoo! does not employ or manage. 
</li><li>This privacy policy incorporates, where applicable, any additional guidance 
    about our privacy practices relating to particular products or services that 
    can be found under the section "More about Yahoo! Privacy" on the 
    top left of this page. 
  </li><li>Find out more information about Yahoo! <a href="http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/uk/archives/details.html">data 
    storage</a> and <a href="http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/uk/access/details.html">data 
    transfer</a>.<br>
    <p></p>
</li></ul>
<b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
<ul><li>Yahoo! collects personally identifying information when you register for a Yahoo! account, when you use certain Yahoo! products or services, when you visit Yahoo! pages, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. 
</li><li>When you register with Yahoo!, we ask for your name, email address, birth date, gender, post code, occupation, industry, and personal interests.  Once you register with Yahoo! and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.
</li><li>Yahoo! also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your <a href="/privacy/uk/ip/details.html">IP address</a>, Yahoo! <a href="/privacy/uk/cookies/details.html">cookie</a> information and the page you requested.
</li><li>Yahoo! uses information for three general purposes: to customise the advertising and content you see, based on the details given by you at registration and your activity at Yahoo!, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to contact you about specials, new products and for customer feedback. </li></ul>

<b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b><br>
<ul><li>Yahoo! will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone.
</li><li>Yahoo! may send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when: 
<ul><li>We have your consent to share the information;
</li><li>We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested;
</li><li>We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Yahoo! to provide a product or service to you; (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.);
</li><li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, any legitimate request by authorities with which we must comply or legal process. 
</li><li>Yahoo! may transfer information about you if Yahoo! acquires, or is acquired by or merged with, another company. In this event, Yahoo! will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
</li></ul>

<b>Cookies</b><br>
<ul><li>Yahoo! may set and access Yahoo! <a href="/privacy/uk/cookies/details.html">cookies</a> on your computer.  
</li><li>Yahoo! allows <a href="/privacy/uk/adservers/details.html">other companies</a> that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.  Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Yahoo!'s cookies.
</li><li>Yahoo! uses <a href="/privacy/uk/pixels/details.html">web beacons</a> to access our cookies within our network of web sites, in connection with Yahoo! products and services and to track your activities on our advertisers websites.
</li></ul>

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. </p><p> 

Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. </p><p>

<b>Yahoo!'s Practices Regarding Cookies</b><p>

</li><li>Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic.
</li><li>Conduct research to improve Yahoo!'s content and services.
</li><li>Require you to re-enter your Yahoo! password after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents.</li></ul>

<b>Other Companies' Cookies on Yahoo!</b><br>
<ul><li>Please note that Yahoo! allows <a href="/privacy/uk/adservers/">other companies</a> that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. </li><li>Advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the <a href="/privacy/uk/">Yahoo! Privacy Policy</a>.
