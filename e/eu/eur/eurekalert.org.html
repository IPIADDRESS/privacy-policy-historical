<!--EurekAlert! Privacy Statement Text-->
<p>
EurekAlert! is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of its users. 
This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, 
how we use it, and how to correct or change it.
</p><p>
Please note that this policy applies only to the EurekAlert! site, 
and not to other Web sites to which EurekAlert! may link. 
Also, given that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, 
we reserve the right to modify portions of this policy at any time. 
You will be alerted to changes in the privacy policy by a notice on the Table of Contents. 
Continued use of EurekAlert! following the posting of changes to these terms will mean 
that you accept those changes.
</p><p>
For questions about policies governing EurekAlert!, contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@eurekalert.org">webmaster@eurekalert.org</a>. 
</p><p>
EurekAlert! is a public service project of the American Association for the Advancement of Science 
in Washington, D.C., and is administered within the News &amp; Information Office. 
</p><p>
<font size="+1"><b>1. Information Gathered by EurekAlert!</b></font>
</p><p>
EurekAlert! is divided into two areas:<br>
</p><ul> 
A public area open to anyone and a restricted area open to registered journalists 
and public information officers (PIOs).
</ul>
 <br>
EurekAlert! gathers two types of information:<ul>
(1) Individual data that journalists and PIOs provide when they register, and <br>
(2) Aggregated data on overall patterns of activity within the site. 
Such information enables us to better tailor our content to users' needs 
and to help those organizations that post news to the site to better understand 
the demographics of those seeing their material.
</ul>
<p>
<!--For a detailed description of the kind of information EurekAlert! collects 
on both public and registered users, click here. 
<P>-->
In general, however, EurekAlert! gathers information such as the date and time of your visit; 
the URL of the last Web page you visited; the type of browser and operating system you're using; 
and your computer's IP address.
</p><p>
EurekAlert! does not sell, rent or trade our list of users.
</p><p>
EurekAlert! will not share information about your individual movement 
within the site or any other personal information about you with any third party. 
However, as mentioned, we may look at general usage patterns by user type 
(public, journalists, PIOs) to help us improve the site.
</p><p>
<b>Two exceptions:</b><br>
Information provided on the registration form is shared with the 
administrators of journals to which the user has requested access via EurekAlert!. 
No other information is shared. Administrators reserve the right 
to accept or reject an individual's access to their journal, 
regardless of whether the user has already been approved by EurekAlert! as a whole.
</p><p>
The second exception would be in the case of an embargo break 
involving material allegedly obtained via someone's password-approved access -- and 
only then in response to a specific request by the journal or research institution 
that submitted the embargoed document, or by the journalist or PIO in question. 
EurekAlert! reserves the right to decline any of these requests if 
there is not sufficient evidence to support the charge. 
If we do agree to provide information related to an alleged embargo break, 
only three factors may potentially be revealed and only to the relevant journal, 
institution, and/or registered user: whether or not the person viewed the document 
for which the embargo was broken; if so, what time of day he or she viewed it; 
and whether his or her request for the file, if made, was successfully fulfilled. 
If we do decide to fulfill such a request by a journal or an institution, 
the user in question will be notified.
</p><p>
<font size="+1"><b>2. Update, Opt-Out and Deactivation Policies</b></font>
</p><p>
You may update the information in your user profile at any time 
by going to the site and clicking on the "User Profile" button. 
However, only a EurekAlert! staff member may change your approved status 
(i.e., reporter, freelancer, or PIO). Requests for change of status should be made 
to webmaster@eurekalert.org. We may also modify the way your information appears in your profile 
to conform to our standards of style. 
</p><p>
<!--Also from the "User Profile" section of EurekAlert!, you may choose to "opt out" 
of any communication we might send to our list of users in the course of doing business. 
That is, users who select this option will  not receive general updates, user surveys, 
promotional materials, newsletters or any type of information we might otherwise provide our users.--> 
</p><p>
You may also remove yourself from EurekAlert!'s database at any time 
by contacting us via email (<a href="mailto:webmaster@eurekalert.org">webmaster@eurekalert.org</a>); telephone (202-326-6716); 
fax (202-898-0391); or mail:
