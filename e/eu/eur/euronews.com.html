Also, we may from time to time maintain a log of certain information concerning the network proarticle of Service users, including without limitation users’ IP addresses (a computer’s numerical Internet address) and the type of web browsers used to access the Service, in anonymous, “aggregate” form (in other words, we do not associate this information with a specific subscriber, and you remain anonymous).

                    <p class="data"><span class="faq_qst">How do we use information we collect? </span><br>

We may use your information to answer a customer service or billing question or other inquiry from you regarding the Service or your account subscription, and for its own internal business purposes.

We may disclose your personally identifiable information in any of the following circumstances: (1) in response to a subpoena, search warrant, court order, or other legal process, or as may otherwise be required by applicable law or regulation; (2) to protect and defend our rights or property or those of our affiliates or others; or (3) as we, in its sole discretion, believe is appropriate under exigent circumstances in response to a perceived significant threat to the personal safety or property of any subscriber to the Service or any other person. In addition, as our subscriber database is our business asset, in the event we are reorganized or is sold to or merged with another company, you consent to the sale, assignment, or transfer of your personally identifiable information to a purchaser of all or substantially all of our business assets, or to our subsidiary or affiliate, as appropriate. Except as described above, we will not disclose, sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to any third party without your consent. </p>

                    <br>
                    <span class="faq_qst">Do we use cookies? </span><br>
                    “Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser on your computer’s hard drive. We use cookies only to log “inbound links” to this website (e.g., through an online advertisement, through a link in a search engine result, through a link on a web page, etc.). We do not use cookies to capture any personally identifying information about you. </p>
                    <p class="data"><span class="faq_qst">What’s our relationship with other websites you can access through the Service? </span><br>
                    This website, and newsgroup postings accessible through the Service, may contain links to other Internet websites, products, and/or services (“Third Party Services”) which provide you with convenient access to publicly available information that you may find of interest. If you use a link to go from the Service to a Third Party Service, this Privacy Policy will no longer apply. Your use of a Third Party Service will be subject to the rules and policies of that Third Party Service, and you are encouraged to read over those rules and policies. Your use of Third Party Services is at your own risk. </p>
                    <p class="data"><span class="faq_qst">What other information should you know about your privacy? </span><br>
                    The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) prohibits certain commercial practices related to gathering, storing, and disclosing personal information about children under the age of 13 who use the Internet. We will not knowingly or intentionally collect personal information about children under the age of 13 without prior parental consent. We cannot prohibit minors from using the Service if they supply a valid username and password issued to another person (e.g., a parent or friend). We must rely on parents, guardians and those responsible for supervision of children to monitor the Internet activities of children under the age of 13. Each time you submit personally identifiable information about yourself or your family through the Service, you are representing to us that your are 18 years of age or older. All electronic communication services such as ours are required to comply with the “mandatory reporting” requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 13032(b), which requires such services to report any apparent child pornography to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. In the event we are required to make a report, it will include all information regarding the apparent child pornography it believes may be of importance. We will strictly comply with this reporting requirement. How can you contact us with questions on this privacy policy? </p>
