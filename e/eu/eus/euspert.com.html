can limit the full use of the Web site.<br>Full cookie policy:
http://uk.euspert.com/content/cookies.html</p>
<p>6) Many services of the portal are provided without giving any
registration data (among the most important are reading and
discussing the contents of the blog magazine and using the search
engine for job offers). When the transmission of data is necessary
for the requested service, as well as for all that is required by
legal obligations, it is obvious that the refusal to provide data in
whole or in part may prevent Euspert to comply with requests and to
perform the services required.</p>
<p>7) A User and a Company (or Recruiter) may cancel its registration
at any time by sending an e-mail to data-protection@euspert.com
(subject: delete) or (preferable, because with immediate effect) by
the internal system. - The Operator reserves the right to delete an
account or stored files that are not updated or active for more than
12 months.</p>
<p>8) The Services provided to Users on the Website include in
particular the option to:</p>
<p>- Reply or respond to posted Job Offer. A User is entitled to
respond to a Job Offer posted on the Website; this Service is also
available to Users not registered on the Website.&nbsp;Some jobs are
only indexed on the site and refer to the original source (Euspert
has no responsibility on the websites which offers recall and their
mode of application), other are inserted directly by the company. In
any case, anonymous jobs being prohibited, each job always shows the
name of the Company (or Recruiter) and the User can contact the

<p>9) Euspert doesn't provide services like a Database of CV's for
Recruiters. Profile CV will be available only to companies that are
granted directly by the user.</p>
<p>Euspert is not a job agency or an intermediary, but simply
provides space to Recruiters and Users to meet in autonomy. Euspert
can never control all the jobs listed and doesn't take responsibility
for the content of the job posts.</p>
<p>We do our best to check the credibility of the companies that
advertise on Euspert however sometimes doing the best is no enough.
We ask you to pay attention and never trust the companies that ask
you money, because Euspert's terms don't allow it. As per Euspert's
terms, none can ask money from Users and the companies offering them
various positions. If you come in contact with such a company please
let us know immediately!</p>
<p>Euspert doesn't take responsibility for the content of the job
posts, application process, job interview, etc.</p>
<p>10) It is mandatory that the user's data entered during
registration, must contain truthful information exonerating Euspert
from the responsibility of entering false and illegal information or
covered by copyright.</p>
<p>11) Euspert (while adopting the maximum safety measures) does not
guarantee that the portal is free of errors or that the portal and /
or servers may not be damaged from external attack or other technical
defects of whatever nature and all users and Companies (or
Recruiters) take note that Euspert in no way can be held liable for
any damages whatsoever, whether in contract, tort, resulting from
access to or use of services offered on the portal and / or
interruption of the operation of the portal.</p>
<p>12) Euspert may at any time remove or suspend an account
(Recruiter or User) from its database (in any case, the removal is
always due to valid reasons)</p>
<p>13) Posting the Job Offer After a successful registration, the
Company (or the Recruiter) is entitled to post a Job Offer on the
Website. The Job Offer is published according to the following rules:</p>
<p>- The Company (or the Recruiter) itself posts a Job Offer and
determines its content, while a Job Offer must contain at least the
minimum criteria specified by the Operator.</p>
<p>- The Operator reserves the right to modify the Job Offer so that
it is in accordance with the custom and practice regarding filling in
the forms on the Website. The Operator reserves the right to modify
the Job Offer to correct any errors or inaccuracies.</p>
<p>- It is absolutely forbidden to ask money (fee or any other
payment) from Users</p>
<p>- It is absolutely forbidden to offer different position of what
is posted in the job post</p>
<p>- It is mandatory to enter all the data required by current
legislation (authorizations necessary, references to the privacy
policy, equal opportunities disclaimer, etc ...). The Recruiter is
responsible for the veracity and the inclusion of such information.
In general, the offer must always respect each criterion of the law
and the recruiter (and never the Operator) is responsible for it.</p>
<p>- It is forbidden to post jobs anonymous or which do not contain
the exact company name or the Recruiter name and data.</p>
<p>14) The Operator reserves the right not to post or delete a posted
Job Offer:</p>
<p>which is contrary to the laws, to ethical standards or decency,<br>in
which the Company (or the Recruiter) conditions the job matching
and/or recruitment or similar employment with a handling fee or other
payment,<br>presenting multiple job offers within a single form for
the job (i.e. within one Job Offer),<br>which is incomplete or
misleading or contains false information or&nbsp; reduces the quality
of Services provided on the Website for other reasons,<br>with
advertising or marketing content or with information about the
products or Services of the Company (or the Recruiter) or of a third
person,<br>which may damage the reputation of the Operator or of a
third party,<br>If the job is of an erotic nature or rises suspicion
about it being this type of work,<br>If the same job was posted
earlier on the Web site by one Company (or the Recruiter),<br>which
includes a job opportunity through MLM (multilevel marketing) or
doorstep sales.</p>
<p>15) User's Profile CV - Euspert doesn't provide services like a
Database CV's for companies. Companies (or Recruiters) can only have
access to the data of Users sent by application directly to them. The
Company (or the Recruiter) is entitled to use the data of Users
obtained from the Operator's CV Database only to find suitable
employees.</p>
<p>16) Before creating a Profile on the Website or sending a Response
to a Job Offer, the User declares that all the provided data is true.</p>
<p>17) Without the express consent of the User, the Operator shall
not be entitled to process the data of the User.</p>
<p>18) The Operator undertakes that it and its authorised persons
that come into contact with the personal data of the User while
carrying out their work shall maintain the confidentiality of the
data in accordance with the Act on Personal Data Protection, and
shall not use such data for personal use or disclosure to third
parties without the consent of the person concerned. Provisions of
this paragraph shall not affect the obligations of the relevant
legislation and/or the decisions of the bodies concerned.</p>
<p>19) The site contains contact forms. The data included in this
form (usually only name and email) will be used only to answer
questions or respond to requests for assistance and never for
promotional purposes or other purposes. Obviously, will not be sold
and shared with third-parties and do not constitute data
registration.</p>
<p>20) Data of private users are collected by the Data Controller by
filling in specific forms (hereinafter referred to as "form")
proposed on line on the website. Forms are of different types
depending on the type of service that the user intends to use.</p>

also register on the site using the Facebook Connect app. Choosing
this type of registration you agree that your data is used in order
to receive emails with jobs and news (emails could be interrupted
with a simple click). Registration with Facebook does not authorize
Euspert to use the data for advertising and promotional purposes (the
user who wants to grant this type of use can set the appropriate
field of authorization in their own private area, without, however,
that the non-provision to grant such authorization would prejudice in
any way the use of the portal).</p>
<p>Mobile: from mobile (smartphone), to simplify registration, you
can register simply by entering your email in the field at
application stage, and then complete the data later by PC. In such a
case the password is generated automatically. Choosing this type of
registration you (user) agree that your data is used in order to
receive emails with jobs and news (emails could be interrupted with a
simple click). This registration does not entitle Euspert to use the
data for promotional purposes and advertising (the user who wants to
grant this type of use can set the appropriate field of authorization
in their own private area, without, however, that the non-provision
to grant such authorization would prejudice in any way the use of the
portal).</p>
<p>Email alert: you can also register by simply entering the email in
the field alert. In such a case the password is generated
automatically. Choosing this type of registration you agree that your
data is used in order to receive emails with jobs and news (emails
could be interrupted with a simple click). This registration does not
entitle Euspert to use the data for advertising and promotional
purposes (the user who wants to grant this type of use can set the
appropriate field of authorization in their own private area,
without, however, that the non-provision to grant such authorization
would prejudice in any way the use of the portal).</p>
<p>The Data Controller collects data on companies on-line on the
website, or through direct contact.</p>
<p>21) Special Categories of Personal Data and unnecessary data (not
required) - Euspert not collect any Special Categories of Personal
Data . Users are not allowed to fit data relating to: racial or
ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
beliefs, membership in political parties or movements, trade-union
membership, data concerning health or sex life and any other Special
Categories of Personal Data identified by legislation.</p>
<p>22) Not required data: Euspert collects only the data strictly
necessary for the service requested. Users are not allowed to enter
personal data unnecessary and not required. In particular users are
are not allowed to include: social security number (or similar), day
and month of birth, home address, marital status, judicial data,
health data, financial data.</p>
<p>23) The personal information of private users are collected by
Euspert in order to allow the user to have their own electronic
profile available for applications and use the advanced features of
the platform in their own restricted area (for example: saving jobs,
select the advanced criteria in the internal search engine, etc ..).</p>
<p>In case of providing a specific consent (not mandatory), the data
provided can be used for commercial purposes, to send commercial and
promotional communications relating to products, services or
commercial activities also related company third-parties, activities
sales, both direct and indirect, of goods and services, for purposes
marketing, sending newsletters and promotion, promotion of training
opportunity, franchise, and any other type of promotional
communications relating to goods and services also with the help (and
communication of data) of commercial third parties.<br>In addition to
these communications (which consent is never mandatory and if given
can' be revoked at any time), Euspert can send at any time to all
registered users emails with information necessary to the correct use
of site (for example, password changes, changes in the operation of
the site, etc. ...).</p>
<p>If the user decides specifically, can also upload the CV Profile
on Euspert (in PDF, word o similar), after registering. Once the
application is made, the user is aware that the companies will always
receive directly the CV (Euspert does not manage any activity of
"intermediation" and selection of the CV) and the Recruiter
can use its Data for the purpose of making job offers, both for the
research object of the application and future research (if not stated
otherwise, in which case specify in the application that the data can
be used only for current research and not for other jobs)</p>
<p>In the interests of transparency and seriousness, Euspert sro
allows its users to take advantage of the functionality and services
of the site and apply for all jobs, even deciding that their data
will NOT be used for promotional and commercial purposes. So at any
time the user can choose (by selecting Do not accept in their own
private area or in registration) to don't authorize the use for this
purpose, but still have full access to the site's features and an
active account as a registered user.</p>
<p>The user can also decide whether or not to grant permission to the
processing of data for sending newsletters and jobs</p>
<p>Euspert doesn't build databases of candidates and does not collect
CVs of candidates for intermediation of labor. So the user is aware
that will have the CV file loaded to the storage platform (such as
might be any external cloud service), but Euspert will not make
available to other companies and will be only the candidate himself
decide to use it to send it to individual companies responding to
individual jobs (and only those companies will receive it directly
and can read it).</p>
<p>The data collection of companies is done in order to make their
data available on line, to insert their jobs and to use the platform
in reserved area.</p>
<p>24) Euspert menage the data in compliance with regulatory
requirements, ensuring full compliance with the law, contracts and
regulations. The registration and processing of data takes place in
paper and electronic form, with logic strictly related to the above,
however, in order to ensure the security and confidentiality of data.
The Data Controller handles personal data and processes them either
directly or using the work of others who act as managers, internal or
external to the structure of the owner, or in the capacity of
appointees. The data are processed by the Data Controller in Slovakia
at the registered office.</p>
<p>25) The personal data concerning the subject may be communicated
and transferred to third parties authorized by the Data Controller,
with the sole purpose of providing the services requested by the
user.</p>
<p>If the user is a jobseeker to present offers by sending the CV to
companies (also using the platform submission tool) it is aware that
these companies also will be data controllers (relieving Euspert from
any use of such)</p>
<p>26) In the event that at any time Euspert decides to transfer or
sell the website to another company or entity, will be sold also all
personal data stored in it, always respecting the laws on privacy and
providing users with the same rights as present in this statement.</p>
