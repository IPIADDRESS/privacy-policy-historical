                      <b>Web Beacons</b>: While you are on our Web Site, or while 
                      you are otherwise viewing our content, you may encounter 
                      Web beacons, which may come from PDE or from third parties, 
                      such as advertisers or content providers. A Web beacon, 
                      which is sometimes also called a Web bug or "clear gif", 
                      is a small graphic image in a Web page, a Web-based document 
                      or an e-mail message, which generally allows the party that 
                      set the Web beacon to monitor certain information about 
                      the viewer of the Web page, Web-based document or e-mail 
                      message, and it may allow access to certain cookies. Web 
                      beacons are usually invisible to the user, because they 
                      are very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel). However, in general, 
                      any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page, including 
                      an advertisement, can act as a Web beacon. Web beacons typically 
                      collect the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from, the 
                      type of browser requesting the Web beacon, the IP address 
                      of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to and the time 
                      the Web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can also be linked 
                      to PII, but PDE does not link information gathered through 
                      Web beacons to PII. PDE may use Web beacons to count visitors 
                      to our Web pages and we may include Web beacons in HTML-formatted 
                      e-mail newsletters in order to count how many newsletters 
                      (or particular articles, links, etc.) we sent were actually 
                      opened. We aggregate all information we collect through 
                      Web beacons and we do not use Web beacons to track any individuals' 
                      use of the Web Site. PDE does not have control over Web
