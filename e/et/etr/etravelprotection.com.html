<p>AGA, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (“we/us/our”), including Jefferson Insurance Company and AGA
Service Company d/b/a Allianz Global Assistance, are committed to protecting
your privacy.&nbsp; By using our products, services
or website, you are consenting to our collection and use of your data under this
Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions</strong>.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Personal Data</u>.&nbsp; “Personal Data” means non-public personal information
that identifies an individual.&nbsp; It doesn’t
include data that is encoded, anonymized or aggregated.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Sensitive Data</u>.&nbsp; “Sensitive Data” means personal information
about an individual’s race or ethnicity; political, religious, ideological or
trade union memberships, opinions, views or activities; medical conditions or
other protected health information (“PHI”) as defined by the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”); financial information
(e.g. account number); sexuality; or administrative or criminal proceedings that
are treated outside pending proceedings. &nbsp;In addition, Sensitive Data includes
information we receive from a third party who treats and identifies the
information as sensitive.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Agent</u>.&nbsp;
“Agent” means any third party that collects or uses Personal Data to
perform tasks on our behalf, or our underwriters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Practices</strong>.&nbsp; We strive to comply with the laws of
the countries in which we do business regarding the protection of your Personal
Data, including the EU Directive on Data Protection.&nbsp; In an effort to comply with such laws, we
have joined the U.S. Department of Commerce's EU Safe Harbor and Swiss Safe
Harbor programs (collectively, “Safe Harbor”), and we adhere to the below principles for
handling your Personal Data. &nbsp;To learn
more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification, please visit

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><u>Notice</u>:&nbsp; We
collect Personal Data from you including information: (i) from forms, such as
application or claim forms; or by telephone, website, email or correspondence;
(ii) that is necessary to complete your transaction with us (e.g. to underwrite
coverage or process claims); (iii) regarding your transactions with us or
others; (iv) we receive from a consumer reporting agency; or (v) you provide to
us or authorize us to collect from others. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>We collect your
Personal Data: (i) to offer, sell, or otherwise make available to you insurance
and assistance products and services; (ii) to provide you with information or
services for such products and services; (iii) to administer your insurance and
assistance products and services for you, including but not limited to providing
travel-related and concierge services, adjudicating claims, conducting quality/satisfaction
assessments, and fraud prevention; or (iv) for purposes to which you’ve
otherwise consented.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For circumstances in
which we are subject to HIPPA, we are required to provide you with notice of
our duties and practices with respect to PHI. Under HIPAA, we may use and
disclose your PHI for one or more of the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>monitoring
the health care treatment you receive &nbsp;(e.g. we may send or receive PHI to/from a
doctor regarding your diagnosis and treatment so we can ensure that you are
being treated in a medically-appropriate facility);</li>
<li>payment
for health services (e.g. we may use your PHI to make payments to a hospital
that has treated you);</li>
<li>to
help run our organization (e.g. we may use your PHI to conduct quality
assessments of the services we have provided to you—however, note that we are
prohibited from using or disclosing PHI that is genetic information about you
for underwriting purposes); or</li>
<li>for
other purposes as required to administer your insurance and/or assistance
product (e.g. we may use your PHI to adjudicate a claim you make under your
travel insurance policy).&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also in some
specific cases need to use or disclose your PHI for one or more of the
following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>for
public health and safety issues;</li>
<li>to
comply with legal or regulatory requirements;</li>
<li>to
address or comply with workers’ compensation, law enforcement, or other
governmental mandates or requests; or</li>
<li>to
respond to lawsuits or legal actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cases where we are
subject to HIPAA, uses and disclosures of your PHI not described above will be
made only with your express authorization.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>When you use our
website, we collect your IP address and other data about your usage.&nbsp; We may use cookies (text files on your
computer) to do so. &nbsp;We also use Google,
Inc.’s Google Analytics service, which uses cookies to transmit your IP address
and other website usage data.&nbsp; Google
stores and aggregates this data to analyze such usage and create reports for us.&nbsp; We, our affiliates and our Agents only use such
website usage data and such Google reports for our internal business purposes
(e.g. optimization of the content you see from us, website improvement, etc.)
and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI”) compliance. &nbsp;By using our website, you are consenting to this
use of cookies.&nbsp; You can refuse cookies
by disabling them in your browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we collect your
Personal Data for any other reason, we’ll notify you before using or disclosing
that data, stating our purpose for collecting and using the data, the types of
non-Agent third parties to which we disclose the data, and the means we offer
you to limit the use and disclosure of the data. If we receive Personal Data from
any entity in the EU, we’ll use that data according to the instructions such
entity gives us regarding notices it provided and the choices made by the
individuals to whom such data relates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><u>Choice</u>.&nbsp; Except
as required by law, we do not share, sell or otherwise disclose your Personal
Data to non-Agent third parties or use it for any purpose other than for which
it was originally collected or as you subsequently authorize.&nbsp; However, if ever we wish to do so, we will offer
you the opportunity to choose not to permit us to use your Personal Data (“opt-out”)
by sending an appropriately detailed request to the address provided below.&nbsp; In the event that we wish to disclose your
Sensitive Data to a non-Agent third party or use such data for a purpose other
than for which it was originally collected or as you subsequently authorize, we
will provide you the affirmative, explicit choice of whether you wish to permit
such disclosure (“opt-in”).&nbsp; Moreover,
except as authorized by law, we will not use or disclose psychotherapy notes,
use or disclose your PHI for marketing purposes, or use or disclose your PHI in
a way that would constitute a sale of PHI under HIPAA unless you expressly
authorize us to do so. You may revoke this authorization at any time, except
that such revocation will not be effective as to actions we have already taken
in reliance on that authorization. </li>

However, we are not required to agree to your request, except as
otherwise required by HIPAA.</p>

<p>Though we make every
effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose Personal Data or

protect or defend our or your rights, interests or property; or (b) comply with
any applicable law, regulation, judicial rule or order, or other mandate.&nbsp; In any such case, we will take reasonable
care to disclose only as much Personal Data as is necessary. </p>

<p>Where we are subject
to HIPPA, you have the right to request to receive confidential communications

HIPPA, at your request, you may inspect, amend, and copy PHI we maintain about
you, and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of your PHI (e.g. health
payment records), in accordance with and as permitted by HIPAA.</p>

your PHI may be directed to us or to the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human
Services.&nbsp; We will investigate and
attempt to resolve any such complaints or disputes internally; however, if we
are unable to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution for such complaint or
dispute, we have agreed to participate in the dispute resolution procedures administered
by the European data protection authorities’ Safe Harbor dispute panel.&nbsp; You will not be
retaliated against for filing a complaint.</li>
