These Agents may be affiliated or nonaffiliated and may include financial services providers (e.g. underwriting insurers) and non-financial companies (e.g. medical service providers, travel service providers, service providers assisting us with our marketing).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For circumstances in which we are subject to HIPPA, we are required to provide you with notice of our duties and practices with respect to PHI. Under HIPAA, we may use and disclose your PHI for one or more of the following purposes:&nbsp;</p><ol>
<li><p>monitoring the health care treatment you receive &nbsp;(e.g. we may send or receive PHI to/from a doctor regarding your diagnosis and treatment so we can ensure that you are being treated in a medically-appropriate facility);&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>payment for health services (e.g. we may use your PHI to make payments to a hospital that has treated you);&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>&nbsp;to help run our organization (e.g. we may use your PHI to conduct quality assessments of the services we have provided to you—however, note that we are prohibited from using or disclosing PHI that is genetic information about you for underwriting purposes); or&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>for other purposes as required to administer your insurance and/or assistance product (e.g. we may use PHI to adjudicate a claim made under an insurance policy).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li>
</ol><br>We may also in some specific cases need to use or disclose your PHI for one or more of the following purposes:<ol>
<li>for public health and safety issues;</li>
<li>to comply with legal or regulatory requirements;</li>
<li>to address or comply with workers' compensation, law enforcement, or other governmental mandates or requests; or</li>
<li>to respond to lawsuits or legal actions.</li>
</ol><div>&nbsp;</div><p>In cases where we are subject to HIPAA, uses and disclosures of your PHI not described above will be made only with your express authorization.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When you access our website, we collect your IP address and other data about your web usage.&nbsp; We may use cookies (text files on your computer) to do so. &nbsp;We also use Google, Inc.’s Google Analytics and AdWords services and other similar third party vendor services, which use cookies to transmit your IP address and other website usage data and browser-generated information.
