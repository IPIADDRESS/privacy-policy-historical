In general, we use log files to monitor traffic on our websites and to troubleshoot technical problems. In the event of user abuse of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses. If available, IP addresses and console IDs may be used to personally identify you in order to enforce our Terms of Service.</p>

<h2><span class="caps">III</span>. What Is Non-Personal Information and When Does <span class="caps">BHVR</span> Collect It?</h2>

Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent.<br>
We may also use flash cookies, also known as “local shared objects,” on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site’s settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Flash cookies only collect data in the aggregate. Like normal cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer.</p>

<p>Please note that this privacy policy covers the use of cookies by <span class="caps">BHVR</span> only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h3>A. How <span class="caps">BHVR</span> Uses Your Information</h3>

<p><span class="caps">BHVR</span> uses your information to operate BHVR’s website, fulfill your specific requests, and to send you account-related information. In addition, if you choose to receive communications from us about <span class="caps">BHVR</span> products and news, the personal information you provide will allow us to send you messages about things including new features, enhancements, contests and events of interest.

B. Will <span class="caps">BHVR</span> Share My Information With Third Parties?</p>

<p><span class="caps">BHVR</span> will never share your personal information with third parties without your consent. We may, however, share non-personal data in the aggregate (in a form that does not personally identify you) with third parties. You may also opt in to allow <span class="caps">BHVR</span> to share your personal information with companies and organizations that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>

<p>From time to time, <span class="caps">BHVR</span> may employ third party contractors to collect personal information on our behalf to provide email delivery, product, or promotional fulfillment, contest administration, credit card processing, shipping or other services on our sites. When requesting these services, you may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address to our contractors. We ask some third party contractors, such as credit agencies or market research firms, to supplement personal information that you provide to us for our own marketing and demographic studies, so that we can consistently improve our sites and to better meet our visitors’ needs and preferences.</p>

<p>When our third party contractors collect and/or have access to the personal information you provide to <span class="caps">BHVR</span>, <span class="caps">BHVR</span> requires that they adhere to our stated privacy policies and protect the confidentiality of personal information they collect or have access to in the course of their engagement by <span class="caps">BHVR</span>. These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose without your specific consent.</p>

<p>We may also disclose personal information to law enforcement, or the appropriate civil authorities to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on <span class="caps">BHVR</span>.</p>

<h2>V. Where Is The Information Held?</h2>

<p><span class="caps">BHVR</span> utilizes data storage facilities located in the United States.</p>

<h2>VI. How Does <span class="caps">BHVR</span> Protect Your Personal Information?</h2>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards, including the guidelines developed by the Online Privacy Alliance and the US Federal Trade Commission to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and in storage. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@eternalcrusade.com" title="privacy@eternalcrusade.com">privacy@eternalcrusade.com</a>.</p>

Should you be unable to log in contact at support@eternalcrusade.com. We will be happy to review, update or remove information as appropriate. We may still retain your information in our files however, to resolve disputes, enforce our user agreement, and due to technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of our websites.</p>

<h2><span class="caps">VIII</span>. Public Information Including User Generated Content, Online Forums, Blogs And Profiles</h2>

<p>You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to <span class="caps">BHVR</span> sites or in public online chat rooms, blogs, message boards, user “profiles” for public view or in similar forums on our sites. Information that you disclose in any of these forums is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality there.</p>

<p>You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit in the course of these public activities can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>

<p>If you post a video, image or photo on one of our sites for public view you should be aware that these may be viewed, collected, copied and/or used by other users without your consent. We are not responsible for the videos, images or photos that you choose to submit to BHVR’s site.</p>

<h2>IX. Third Party Sites</h2>

<p>Our website may contain advertising or services which link to other websites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the <span class="caps">BHVR</span> site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as <span class="caps">BHVR</span>. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to a <span class="caps">BHVR</span> site, you should consult that site’s privacy policy before providing any personal information.</p>

<h2>X. Products Offered In Partnership with Third Party(s)</h2>

<p>Members may register for other services from our site(s). Certain products and/or services available on our site are provided to you in partnership with third party(s) and may require you to disclose personally identifiable information in order to register for and access such products and/or services. Such products and/or services shall identify the third party partners at the point of registration. If you elect to register for such products and/or services your personally identifiable information will be transferred to such third party(s) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of such third party(s). We are not responsible for the privacy practices and policies of such third party(s) and, therefore, you should review the privacy practices and policies of such third party(s) prior to providing your personally identifiable information in connection with such products and/or services.</p>

<h2>XI. Your Consent Is Important To Us</h2>

<p>It is important to us that where we collect, use or disclose your personal information we have your consent to do so. Depending on the sensitivity of the personal information, your consent may be implied, deemed (using an opt-out mechanism) or express. Express consent can be given orally, electronically or in writing. Implied consent is consent that can reasonably be inferred from your action or inaction. </p>

<p>You may change or withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice, by contacting our Privacy Policy Administrator using the contact information set out below. In some circumstances, a change in or withdrawal of consent may severely limit our ability to provide services to, or acquire products or services from, you. All communications with respect to such withdrawal or variation of consent should be in writing and addressed to your consultant or our Officer.</p>
