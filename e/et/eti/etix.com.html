<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Etix.com understands that your right to	privacy is a very important. We have created this privacy statement in
order to demonstrate our continued commitment to your privacy.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Our site uses cookies to keep track of your purchases. We may use cookies to save your membership password,
to deliver content designed to match your interests, and for various other purposes relating to your transactions on the Site.</p> 
<h2>Your Internet Protocol (IP)	Address</h2>
<p>Etix.com uses your IP address to help with problems and for identification purposes only.</p>
<h2>Information You Give Etix.com</h2>
<p>Etix.com's forms require you to give us	certain contact information such as your name, address, email address,
and credit card number. Sometimes, we may need you to provide us with additional information, such as an Etix.com member password, or
demographic information such as your age or income level.</p> 
<h2>Contact Information</h2>
<p>Etix.com may use your contact information to contact you about any aspect of your financial transaction.
Information may also be used by the shipping company, when applicable, to deliver your tickets. Your contact information is provided to the
venue and promoters of the event for which you purchase tickets. The purpose of releasing your name and email address to the promoter or
venue is so that you may be contacted regarding special offers or upcoming events. Etix.com may also use your information to send you
information and offers from our company and promotional material from some of our clients.
We will strive to make sure this information is of value to you. </p>
<h2>How Etix.com Uses Financial	Information</h2>
<p>Any financial information that is given	to Etix.com will be used only in the processing and delivery of your
tickets. The information you provide will be used to verify the	transaction and receive the money directly from your credit card
company. Some financial information may be used by Etix.com to identify the customer at the venue (e.g. your last four credit card
digits used to identify that you are the person who purchased the ticket). Under NO circumstances will Etix.com ever release any of your
credit card information to a third party. If you would rather that Etix.com not release any of your information to third parties, you
must request this in writing by regular mail or email. In the written request, please provide include your name, address, and email address.
The request must also state, "I do not wish to have Etix.com release any of my personal information to third parties, nor do I wish
Etix.com to disclose any further information about me." If sending an email request, it must be sent from the same email address listed on
your account to ensure security. </p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Etix.com's website may contain links to	other websites of interest. However, we are not responsible for the
content, privacy policies, or security of any other websites. </p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>At Etix.com e-commerce is a way of life. We have utilized all of the latest technological advances to ensure
that your transaction is secure. Our Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software is the best available today for secure electronic commerce
transactions. It encrypts all of your information, including your credit card number, so that it cannot be read as the information
travels over the Internet. If you have any questions about our security, please contact us at support@etix.com or 1-919-653-0444. We
have one of the most secure sites on the Internet. </p>
