Yet your retirement future can be unpredictable. You might not have as much time to save as you had expected, your expenses in retirement might be higher than planned, and your income could be lower in retirement versus your working years. And, with today's volatile financial markets, expecting steady, reliable growth of your nest egg can be a risky proposition.   Although the road to a comfortable retirement is full of uncertainty, the good news is that you don't need to predict the future to be able to prepare for it. You have the power to make decisions today that will directly impact how you live tomorrow. With that in mind, here are four risks that may impact your retirement and suggestions on how you can address them, whether you are still building up your savings or have already begun drawing them down.  1. Inflation  The longer you are in retirement, the greater the impact inflation is likely to have on the purchasing power of your money and, therefore, your lifestyle and finances. For example, if you had $100 in 2004, inflation would have reduced the purchasing power of that $100 to $77.46 by 2014.[1]  In addition, retirees are subject to a phenomenon known as senior inflation. That's because retirees tend to more frequently purchase inflation-sensitive goods and services such as medication, hospital services and other health care arrangements, while younger consumers are more apt to spend on things like electronics, clothing and housing.  2. Market Volatility  Over the very long term, and historically speaking, investing in the stock market has provided the best opportunity for growth. But over the last 15 years there has been substantial volatility. In fact, during the last 14 years, the S&amp;P 500® Index has been chopped in half twice![2] And timing and luck could play a large role in whether your portfolio is poised to provide the necessary income needed in retirement. A market downturn when you're two to five years away from retirement is something that may be difficult to recover from in time to keep your retirement plans on track. Do you have the time to weather this volatility and the risks that come along with it?  3. Longevity  For pre-retirees and retirees, living longer can bring the inherent risk of outliving your assets. According to the National Retirement Planning Coalition, if both you and your spouse are now 65, there is a 50 percent chance that one of you will live to age 85.[3] Today's retirees need to ensure that their retirement income can last at least 20-30 (or even more) years past their retirement date, a significant increase from just a generation ago. Furthermore, not properly accounting for longevity risk can dramatically impact quality of life in retirement, forcing retirees to accept a lower standard of living, reduced care or potentially going back to work.   4. Interest Rates  Traditional advice has said that as you approach retirement you should reduce your exposure to stocks and increase your allocation to more conservative fixed income investments, such as bonds and bond funds. Indeed, over the past three decades, falling interest rates have resulted in strong historical returns making these &quot;fixed income&quot; investments attractive to investors. Why? Because bond fund prices rise as bond interest rates fall. But bond interest rates are at historic lows. According to recent guidance from the Federal Reserve, there is an expectation that they will increase the federal funds rate at some point during 2015. If this happens, it is possible your fixed income investments could decline in value, meaning you may need to save more to create adequate retirement income.  Retirement planning certainly comes with its challenges, but you can take steps now to help ensure you have resources you can rely on later. A first step is simply creating a written plan. This can boost your confidence and make abstract risks and fears seem more manageable. According to proprietary consumer research we recently conducted at Genworth, those with a formal savings plan and a formal plan for taking income from their assets in retirement are significantly more likely to feel confident that they will be able to meet their financial goals compared to those who have not taken as many formal steps toward retirement planning.[4]   Start by outlining your goals and objectives, taking into account some of the more predictable risks such as inflation or living longer, and build in a savings cushion accordingly.  Next, make sure you have a well-diversified portfolio that can potentially protect against, or benefit from factors like market volatility or interest rate movements. Consider income-oriented vehicles that don't lose value in times of rising interest rates and that can supplement your Social Security and/or pension payments once you retire. An annuity might be part of this solution. Depending on the type, they can provide a guaranteed stream of lifetime income and protect your principal, regardless of what markets or interest rates do, making it particularly relevant in a world of uncertainty.   While there are a number of potential risks to consider and planning for them may seem daunting, a fulfilling retirement may be within reach. The fact of the matter is that the more prepared you are, the better off you'll be. Talk with a financial professional to learn more about the options available to you, and how they can help increase your income and protect your retirement lifestyle.

And I really don't know any teacher that doesn't work another job of some kind.&quot;  The Council of Chief State School Officers named Peeples the 2015 Teacher of the Year late last month. Peeples, who teaches at Palo Duro High School, spoke to The Huffington Post this week -- teacher appreciation week -- about the current challenges facing teachers, why they often feel underappreciated and the students of whom she is most proud.  Unlike her peer and mentor Nancie Atwell, who was honored this year with an award that has been dubbed the &quot;Nobel Prize of teaching,&quot; Peeples thinks &quot;now is the time&quot; to go into teaching.   In March, Atwell told CNN she would advise kids against becoming teachers, because &quot;public school teachers are so constrained right now by the Common Core Standards and the tests that are developed to monitor what teachers are doing with them.&quot;  &quot;I understand why [Atwell] said what she said and in context, that she felt there was a lot of pressure on teachers,&quot; Peeples said. &quot;I'm going to take the exact other [approach]. I don't think that there's a better time to go in. I think now is the time you want to do it, especially if you're young and you want to make a difference and you're idealistic.&quot;  &quot;To me,&quot; she continued, &quot;there's nothing more meaningful than teaching.&quot;  Peeples, like Atwell, is an English teacher. She works with a range of students -- some are top performers in Advanced Placement classes, while others have recently been released from jail.   In a ceremony last week, President Barack Obama praised Peeples for her work with students who recently came to America from war-torn countries.   &quot;Many of her students face challenges that would overwhelm adults, let alone kids. ... Many are refugees from places like Iraq and Somalia, many of them have known trauma and violence in their lives,&quot; Obama said. &quot;Shanna’s classroom provides them a safe haven.&quot;    Through working with these students, Peeples said she has learned lessons that can help teachers who find themselves in classrooms with students who experience violence in their homes or neighborhoods.   &quot;My own background, coming out of a home with domestic violence, alcoholism ... the trauma is similar, unfortunately,&quot; said Peeples. &quot;I see the same sorts of trauma responses in my students who were born and raised in Amarillo as I see with students who fled terrible things in Burma and Africa.&quot;  &quot;I think the most important thing you can do is make [the classroom] a safe space ...  work on building trust immediately, and that trust may mean that you have to make unique allowances for that student's unique situation,&quot; she continued. &quot;It's sort of a plea to look at each child uniquely and find out what their greatest need is as far as feeling safe in your classroom.&quot;  She said that although local students and parents seem to appreciate educators, society at large does not always value the profession.   &quot;There seems to be, in some places, a hostile climate for public education and teachers. That's definitely a shift I've seen,&quot; Peeples, who has been teaching for 13 years, said. &quot;The people who love public schools and teachers don't really have a megaphone. ... I don't really understand what's going on, but you can feel it.&quot;   Indeed, a poll HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted last week found that even though most people seem to like the public school teachers in their community, many think teachers are generally underappreciated and underpaid.  Appreciation from students, Peeples said, is &quot;what teachers live on. I tell teachers when I speak to them ... save everyone of those drawings, everyone of those letters [of appreciation from students]. That's as close as you're going to get to a parade.&quot;  Finally, Peeples spoke about what she considers one of her greatest success stories, a student named Angel who was court ordered to attend a night program she taught.   &quot;I did this ridiculous Jedi mind trick on him,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm very proud of it. I went to him and I said, 'Angel, I do this class in the daytime and these boys I teach think all the books I teach are stupid and boring and dumb. You just came out of court and jail, you have a pretty exciting life, would you write me something so they could read it?'&quot;  Peeples said Angel &quot;was willing to do the editing and revision on it because he knew it was going to be for a real audience and a real purpose. To me, that's a success story that's as big as my student who went to Harvard, because that meant that Angel was going to keep coming back ... and he really saw the value of working on his voice and expressing himself in an authentic way.&quot;   -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Give yourself the best chance for success by setting up automatic transfers to your savings and investment accounts. Carefully consider your time frame when choosing investments.  Dear Carrie,  I'm turning 30 and know that I need to get serious about saving. How much should I be setting aside?  -- A Reader  Dear Reader,  Thank you for this question. The future can seem so far away, and the path to that future so unsure, that it can be difficult to know exactly how much to save... or even to find the motivation to get started. The reality, though, is that the earlier we start to save -- whether it's for retirement or other goals -- the less difficult the challenge becomes.    Let's start with retirement A comfortable, secure retirement is the biggest financial challenge most of us will ever face, so I think it's always smart to put it at the top of your priorities.  The following guidelines are not absolute, but they can give you a reasonable estimate of what it takes to prepare for retirement. As you can see, the earlier you start, the smaller the bite: If you're getting started in your 20s, save 10-15 percent of your pre-tax income. If you're getting started in your 30s, save 15-25 percent of your pre-tax income.  If you're in your early 40s, save 25-35 percent of your pre-tax income -- a pretty meaningful chunk of your income.  After that, the percentages start to get big quickly. A 45-year-old, for example, will need to save about 40 percent of pre-tax income; someone over 50 who is just starting to save will need to set aside about 60 percent of pre-tax income.   The real beauty of these guidelines (especially for those who are young) is that the percentages won't change as you get older. If you're 30 and can save 15-20 percent of your income for retirement, you probably won't need to save more than 15-20 percent as you age. Starting early is a huge advantage, provided that you remain consistent throughout your working life.  Don't get me wrong. I understand that saving 15 percent of your pre-tax income when you're 25, or 20 percent of your income when you're 30, is tough -- especially when you're trying to pay off student loans or manage other financial obligations. But the numbers don't lie -- retirement is a hugely expensive challenge, and the earlier you start preparing for it, the better.   Also realize that you can choose to either lessen the hit to your current income by contributing to a tax-deductible account such as a traditional 401(k) or an IRA. Alternatively, you can channel your savings into a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA, paving the way for future tax savings.  And then move on to your other goals Once your retirement savings are on track, it's time to broaden your sights: Emergency fund: Make sure you have enough cash set aside to cover three to six months' worth of non-discretionary expenses. Keep this money in a savings or other liquid account. You won't earn a lot of interest, but you will be increasing your financial security. A child's education: If you have kids, I recommend considering a 529 plan to shelter investment gains and income from taxes. The amount you need to save will depend on your income and the type of college (public or private) you envision. The down payment on a house: A more near-term goal for many people is buying a home. Given today's real estate market, this is not an easy task. To get the best mortgage rates, aim to save a minimum of 20 percent of the purchase price. Other goals: If you have other goals (for example, travel or starting a business), put those on the list as well. Determine the amount you want to save by a particular date, and back out the math.  Put your savings on automatic Once you've determined your savings goals, I highly recommend that you arrange an automatic transfer to your savings or investment accounts each month; that way, you won't have to consciously make the &quot;save or spend&quot; decision each month. A payroll deduction plan is ideal for retirement, especially if it goes into a tax-advantaged plan like a 401(k) or an IRA account. (Your 401(k) plan contributions are often matched to some degree by your employer -- making your effective savings rate even higher.)  Invest according to your time frame. Finally, understand that &quot;saving&quot; is different than investing. You can't afford to take risks when you're saving for a short-term goal. But when you're striving to meet a goal that is at least five years in the future, it's prudent to consider tapping the potential of the financial markets (particularly the equity markets) to give your savings the chance to grow into wealth.

She passed away six years ago, and I would love to hear her voice one more time.   When you lose you mom, you lose your fan club. That's why it's important to celebrate your mom while she's still in your life.   Moms are special people. Some days she may drive you crazy, but ultimately, your mom cares for you, gives you support and has your best interest at heart. So in honor of Mother's Day, here are a few ways to make your mom feel extra special.  Create a custom gift basket. You know what your mother loves. Think of all the things she'd never buy for herself. Create a goodie basket filled with gourmet coffees, teas and assorted snacks.   Give &quot;favor coupons.&quot; Create a handmade coupon book for your mom to use when she needs a break. Each coupon is good for a different favor. For example, you could offer to do the dishes, vacuum, take the dog for a walk, wash her car, or make dinner.  Call her via Skype. You can still connect even if you aren't able to visit your mom on Mother's Day. Use FaceTime or Skype to get some one-on-one time from far away. She'd love to catch up and see your smiling face.  Make it a party. If your mom loves to socialize, throw a Mother's Day party. Coordinate with friends or neighbors to celebrate their moms too. Your mom will be able to spend time with friends and enjoy her special day.  Make a Mother's Day card. Store-bought cards sometimes lack the personalized emotion of a handwritten note. Write a letter to your mom and share pictures and a special memory. Let her know how much you care and how much you love her.  Compile a family photo book. Gather photos of your entire family. If possible, reach out to extended family members for their pictures. Then create a photo album or scrapbook filled with memories. Add your favorite quotes or family sayings for a personal touch.  Gift personalized jewelry. Instead of generic earrings, have the names of all your mother's children inscribed on a necklace or pendant. Or, create a charm bracelet. Handpick charms that represent your mom's favorite hobbies. One year my four siblings and I gave our mom a ring adorned with five sapphire stones. Each stone represented each of her five children.   Make her breakfast. Whip up some of your favorite recipes and invite the entire family to spend a meal together. If your cooking skills are not up to par, host a potluck dinner or order takeout.   Schedule time together. Give your mom the gift of time. Treat her to dinner at a nice restaurant, a cultural event like a ballet or play, or take her to the spa. The activity is less important than spending quality time together to talk and reconnect.

I was excited to have her home on a beautiful April day, the kind of day we'd been dreaming about all winter, as we'd shivered at the bus stop in down jackets, carefully avoiding the ice. I had it all planned out: while my toddler napped, my daughter and I would color the sidewalk, blow bubbles, and laugh together in the sunshine.   You know what they say about the best-laid plans.  My toddler, excited his big sister was home, refused to nap. And so our twosome became a threesome. I tried desperately to find activities we could all enjoy, from running around the yard to playing hide and seek. But the same thing happened that always does: outside, where rocks and trees beckon little people to climb and explore, I ended up spending all my time following around my toddler. While my daughter was pretending to be a princess, being chased by an evil Mommy witch, I was desperately trying to pull my 2-year-old off a rock he had scaled. While she was hiding, waiting to be found, I was chasing a toddler venturing too close to the street.  Before long, my daughter stormed off, her arms folded and a frown on her face. When I asked what was wrong, she replied, &quot;Nothing.&quot; But I knew what the problem was.  The problem was three feet tall and mostly covered in peanut butter.    As an only child, juggling between children is foreign to me. Growing up, I had my parents' undivided attention. I never had to watch a &quot;baby show&quot; on TV when I had outgrown it, or restart a card game because my little brother was chewing on the cards. And yet, this is my daughter's daily reality. Whenever the three of us are together, somehow my toddler hoards all of Mommy's attention. And as hard as I try to include her, I feel my daughter slipping away in a cloud of unspoken resentment. Every time I tell her to &quot;hold on&quot; or &quot;just give Mommy a minute,&quot; while I remove a pebble from my son's mouth, I feel my heart break for her.  And, just a little, for me too.  Because as badly as she wants to hold on to me, I want to hold on to her. As she enters the world of reading independently, drop-off playdates and -- gasp! -- first grade, I watch her childhood slipping away before my eyes. And as much as I want to savor each moment, I'm distracted -- by diaper changes, by child locks little hands somehow pried open, by the day-to-day demands of life with a 2-year-old. And I miss my daughter every day.  That's not to say the three of us don't share wonderful moments as well. Like when my son hugs his sister tight,and she whispers, &quot;I love you, too.&quot; Or when they invent games together. Or when we all laugh about some silly song Mommy made up, and before long no one can remember the joke, but no one can stop laughing either.  For my part, I try to set aside special Mommy-daughter time -- when we go out for ice cream, or play laser tag or even just run errands together. But life gets busy, and between swim classes, birthday parties, and other obligations, somehow there's never enough time for all I want to do together. And so our little threesome soldiers on, with competition and hurt feelings quietly shadowing our daily fun. But I'm optimistic. My little girl may be growing up... but not before we have a few more Mommy-daughter ice cream dates. Because nothing heals a broken heart like rainbow sprinkles.

We've reached our goal in supporting the SOS Children's Villages, but please continue to share in support of our continual effort to help children in crisis. Scroll to the bottom to find out more.  Last month I was in India visiting medical professionals who have dedicated their lives to the most vulnerable among us: unborn children and infants. I was humbled to learn about Mary*, a skilled birth attendant who travels by rope cord over deep and vast bodies of water to reach pregnant women who would otherwise have no access to basic pre and postnatal care in their rural surroundings of Northeast India.  Newborn or neonatal deaths account for 40 percent of all deaths among children under five. The majority of these deaths (75 percent) occur during the first week of life, and between 25 to 45 percent occur within the first 24 hours. As a mother, it breaks my heart to know that up to two thirds of these deaths could be prevented if skilled health workers -- like Mary -- perform effective interventions at birth and during the first week of life.   As I reflect on these statistics, I can't help but think back to one year ago, when my daughter made her entrance to the world. I had all the comforts modern medicine could provide: a clean and equipped hospital, a competent physician and nurse team and a multi-day hospital stay to help me recover from an unplanned cesarean section.   But what if my daughter hadn't won the proverbial &quot;birth lottery&quot;? Two-thirds of neonatal deaths occur in just 10 countries, with India (my country of origin) accounting for more than a quarter and Nigeria for about a tenth. With no doctor, no anesthesia -- not even a sterile surface to deliver the baby -- it's unlikely that my daughter or I would have survived what I now consider one of the most memorable days of my life, had we lived in certain parts of rural India.   The United Nations said it best: Maternal and neonatal mortality in the developing world is not only a public-health concern, but a fundamental human right. That's why I lead an organization devoted to these issues called Samahope. At Samahope we empower medical professionals, like Mary, to expand their ability to reach more mothers and children in need.   What is the single most important thing every child needs? Simply put, it's a chance at life beyond the womb.   *Name changed for privacy reasons  We Reached Our Goal: From March 23 until April 24, the Relay for Kids blog series unlocked a donation from Johnson &amp; Johnson to SOS Children's Villages in support of their work in helping children in crisis.

Even though 57 % of the American professional workforce has comprised women in 2013, in a ratio that in-fact skews the optimum 1:1 evolutionary ratio in favor of the ladies, women accounted for only 26 percent of the workforce in the area of technology and computers. Is there an explanation for this logic-defying ratio? Are the two X chromosomes somehow inclined to steer its bearers away from a field that practically defines the world now?  The dearth of women in technology has long been attributed to the pipeline problem of fewer girls in the STEM area of education. Although at the K12 level, girls are taking high level mathematics and science courses at similar rates as their male classmates, the ratio continues to remain lopsided when it comes to computer science, as shown by a survey of the Advanced Placement Exams - only 19% of girls took the computer science exam in 2011.    Dr. Rob Garcia, an educator and Mayor of the City of Long Beach, collates the reasons for fewer girls in computer science into the following key facts: lack of female role models (despite the world's very first programmer being a woman) and mentors; engrained societal gender stereotypes reinforced by friends, family and community; lack of confidence due to internal feelings of inadequacy (Impostor Syndrome), and differential teaching practices in the classroom. This situation is slowly changing with increasing awareness of the importance of encouraging girls to take up computer science both within families and in the social setup. For example, with the help of the Clinton Global Initiative America, the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology, through its Aspirations in Computing program, is working to add 10,000 more girls from kindergarten through graduate school, to the nation's technology talent pool.  Such awareness and initiatives are already showing benefits. In a first in more than a few decades, University of California, Berkeley saw more number of women than men (106 to 104) taking computer science in college in 2014. If such a trend is seen in other institutions as well (it is already seen in Stanford), and if all these students graduate successfully in four years, the dismal 12.9% female computer science graduates seen in 2012 could be boosted significantly.  Will the spike in female computer science graduates translate to more number of women in the tech industry? There are factors beyond education that cause the disturbing gender disparity. In a report titled &quot;The Athena Factor: Reversing the Brain Drain in Science, Engineering, and Technology,&quot; Harvard Business Review reports that more than half of the number of women in science, engineering and technology leave the field and never come back. The report also lists five &quot;antigens&quot; that cause this drain -- marginalization by hostile macho culture; isolation in a male-dominated (bro-gramming?) environment; stalling -- the gendered glass-ceiling; the need for risk and reward mentality and family (child rearing) reasons.  The apparent family-versus-job tussle as the single most important reason for women leaving tech-industry is not supported by statistics -- the National Center for Women and Information Technology reports that although 56 percent of women with technical jobs leave their work midway through their careers, 31 percent go on to taking nontechnical jobs, which means that child-rearing is not necessarily the primary reason women move away.    Marginalization by hostile macho culture seems to be a widespread phenomenon in the tech industry. Vivek Wadhwa, American technology entrepreneur, found that 33 percent of female tech entrepreneurs faced &quot;dismissive attitudes&quot; from their colleagues and 15 percent said their abilities had been questioned. A recent research showed that 72% of U.S. women felt gender bias at work in their evaluations, and this is not merely subjective opinions or rants, it is supported by numbers -- nearly 88% of women in 28 tech companies received critical feedback (most of which involving the word &quot;abrasive&quot;) against 59% of men (none of whom was called &quot;abrasive&quot;).  Even after transcending the &quot;culture fit&quot; mismatch rampant in techdom, the male-dominated workplace could lead to isolation. Isolation is particularly severe up the ladder. According to the Kauffman Foundation, women account for only 10 percent of founders of &quot;high-growth&quot; firms. The challenges for women-owned firms include lack of mentors, their own view of success and failure, and a financing gap.  Pay disparity is another metaphorical elephant in the room that catalyzes the exodus of women from tech fields. A recent study from Glassdoor shows that women make less and are less satisfied with their jobs. Narrow the Gapp reports that women who work in computer and mathematical occupations make 84 cents to every dollar a man earns for the same job. The numbers are controversial, but research shows that even after adjusting for education, work hours etc., the pay gap is still an un-ignorable 14%.  Interestingly, the downward trend of women participation in technology is worst in the United States. In tech-intensive countries such as China and India, the situation is better, if not ideal. As early as 2004, India surpassed the United States in women's IT workforce participation at 35%, and the figure continues to grow. That said, pay disparity continues to be plague the Indian IT industry, but given that many of the tech companies in India are of American origin, where does the problem lie? More Chinese tech companies have women in management positions than the Silicon Valley. This trend provides much food for thought and research and possibly interesting pointers on gender diversity vis-a-vis cultural and economic environments.  Any change to betterment is slow and takes a lot of effort and initiative. Like the three waves of the feminist movement that were pivotal in the empowerment of women in society, it takes concerted and consistent effort by women, families, society, industry and academia to bring about management course corrections to eliminate and not just narrow the gender gap in technology. The foundation must be laid early on. Women's organizations and universities already have outreach programs to encourage girls to take up computers in education. With such programs, coupled with the awareness that 2020 would see 1.4 million new jobs in technology, it is but natural for women to partake of their fair share of the pie. The change, though gradual, is palpable, and it will involve attitude, intention and effort by society as a whole to catalyze the process.

The pain of loss may be especially poignant for mothers without living children. Memories of loss transposed onto a world awash in flowers and greeting cards leaves women reeling. Too often, their experience of motherhood is largely unacknowledged by society. Taking place in May, a month that pulses with such tremulous beauty in long-awaited spring, Mother's Day can threaten to break the best of us.   Says Toni Brabec, whose only baby daughter Olivia died in 2013:  Before, I saw Mother's Day like most people do. A special day to honor our mothers... [I]'d pick out cards, a small gift... Now on Mother's Day, I would rather stay in or just have a small gathering... [F]or me, who has no evidence of children other than the photos in my house, I am overlooked and/or it is assumed I am not a mother at all... it is difficult because in my heart, I know I am a mother. But the world doesn't always see it like that.  This is what loving family and friends can consider doing to help support mothers without living children coping with loss.   1.	Do acknowledge and affirm her standing as mother.  You can absolutely include bereaved mothers in Mother's Day events. This may feel initially awkward, but it truly is both appropriate and helpful. The tone of inclusion may feel a bit more subdued, but the mother without living children should have her heroic struggle to mourn, remember, and find meaning marked. She will decline if she is not comfortable, but she will appreciate the invitation.   2.	Do send a card.  It is comforting to receive an acknowledgement in the mail regarding loss. These cards are evidence of the existence of babies gone too soon, and these apparently slight things carry precious love to shore up mothers mourning and remembering.   3.	Don't try to talk her out of grief.  Resist the impulse to try to make her feel better. Instead, let her miss her child. Most expressions of grief that tow with them an undercurrent of the &quot;at least,&quot; will only inadvertently push the bereaved away.   4.	Do ask her questions about her loss/her birth/her stillbirth.  Depending upon your relationship to the bereaved, dialogue can be helpful.  It promotes the integration of grief and complex healing. Loss, when processed, can reveal phenomenally painful truths about being alive. However, the other side of the pain is the recognition of the beauty that is also inherent in living. Bereaved mothers don't take much for granted. They can teach a great deal in this regard.   5.	Do take care to acknowledge the loss of their baby.  If you see a Facebook post pertaining to loss, the mother is reaching out. Go ahead and comment -- add your voice to the supportive community. You may not know what to say, but &quot;I am thinking of you,&quot; is a powerful statement.   Part of the isolation born of perinatal loss is the lack of shared memories. It is for this reason that efforts to invite the sharing of memories have great import. The bereaved mother is working to find her place in a whole new world. It is a lonely journey and she does appreciate the company. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

I was at a lab getting my third blood draw of the day, and had just seen her in the waiting room. She'd looked 23, maybe 24. She was slight and sinewy, with blonde hair in a bun and anxious eyes. She had just been watching dog videos on her phone and had been sitting next to a woman with pursed lips, a stressed demeanor. It was her mother.    I sat, getting my arm swiped with alcohol, feeling thankful for the one test tube on the table, my baby actively kicking. I was in for a pregnancy glucose tolerance test, a three-hour test to see if I have gestational diabetes.  A shrill whimper suddenly came from the next room, and it sent a shock wave through me. It was the young woman. She started to cry fearfully, sounding like a child.   My limbs hesitated, eyes instinctively welled with tears. I looked at the phlebotomist.   &quot;Is she OK? She must be really afraid of needles.&quot; I searched her face for concern.  &quot;Mm hmm,&quot; she said, expressionless, and stuck the needle.  The woman sounded terrified. I wondered what must be going on in that room, how the mother was responding, what she must be feeling.   Your baby is always your baby.  I thought of my 3-year-old, the countless times I'd responded to her cries, had rushed to her because she was sick, because she'd had a bad dream, because she needed her Mama. Even now, her slightest sounds will wake me, shoot me upright in bed listening, breathless. Three years of sleep deprivation, plus a few scary-high fevers and stomach viruses, can do that to a parent.  After my test, I sat back in the waiting room, pretended to read when the woman and her mom rushed past me, escaped to the parking lot.   &quot;She just needs some air,&quot; the mother called over her shoulder. I looked at them through the window.  The daughter was visibly shaking. I could hear her frenetic cries, watched her mom wrap her arm around her, direct her to the car. Then she came back in and walked quickly toward the exam rooms.  She returned minutes later.  &quot;Is your daughter OK?&quot; I asked.  She looked deflated. &quot;No, she's not OK medically at all.&quot;  &quot;I'm so sorry.&quot;  She paused, emotion building, then pursed her lips and left.  She was old enough to be my own mother, but in that moment I felt like we were just moms. Moms who worry about their kids. Moms who want to make everything all right, who want to soothe, who want to support and encourage. Moms who want to be present and strong, who want to give, who never press pause, who never stop.   I thought of my own daughter, how soon I'll be the mom of two daughters. How this will never cease, this mother in me. I will always see the world as a mama. I will always think as a mama. I will always see others as someone's child. I will always admire other moms, other dads, anyone who cares for another life.  To the mother of that child, the mother in me sees you, and you've got this. You are doing great. You are strong. You are brave. You are resilient. And you are never, ever alone. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.
