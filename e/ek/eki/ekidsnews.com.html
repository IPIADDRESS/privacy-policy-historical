As far as I knew, no one in my immediately family had done it because they didn't want to be &quot;chewed up.&quot; That turned out to be the perfect way to describe how I felt for the first several weeks of my nursing experience. It seemed like I was running into issue after issue, and since I had little family support, I went through lots of needless trial and error. But as a millennial mama, I should've realized that there was, in fact, an app for that. Here are the apps, gadgets and creative solutions designed to save the savvy breastfeeding mother.   Issue #1: How much milk is your baby getting?  Solution: Momsense I love my pediatrician, really, I do. But she (and many other pediatricians) are simply not well-versed in lactation education. Used to her roster of bottle-feeding moms, she would ask me at every appointment how many ounces we were getting daily, and I would stare at her blankly. That's where Momsense comes in, a sleek looking pair of headphones with a baby sensor attached. The sensor measures how much milk baby is taking in by calculating their &quot;effective swallows&quot; -- and records all this information for you on a handy (and pretty!) smartphone app. It's super satisfying for technical people like me that love statistics. $89.99, Buy it here.   Issue #2: Pumping sucks.  Solution: BeauGen Nipple Cushion At worst, pumping was unbearable nipple torture that resulted in a pathetic looking spray of milk in an impossibly large 6oz bottle. At best, it was something I had to do if I wanted to leave the house. Thankfully, someone shared my pain and thought up a creative way of relieving it. BeauGen  makes a tiny, stretchy, one-size-fits-all nipple cushion that, for me, eliminated nearly all of the discomfort and sizing issues I was having with my pump. The BeauGen is easy to clean, simple to use, and honestly, such an obvious and ingenious solution that I'm embarrassed I didn't think of it myself. As a bonus for this tiny life-saver, it makes pumping more discreet, as the pink cushion obscures your nipple in the flange. $30, Buy it here.   Issue #3: One of my boobs won't stop leaking!  Solution: Milkies Milk-Saver This was me (and still is most days), perpetually staunching an overflow on my right side only. (Isn't it crazy how breasts have different personalities?) I would be fine nursing or pumping on the right, but if I tried to nurse on the left, I'd have an enormous letdown that would soak the right side of my shirt almost immediately. The Milkies Milk-Saver, seemingly designed with me in mind, allowed me to collect all that breast milk that was going to waste. You simply slip it into your bra or tank on the non-nursing/overzealous side. To be honest, I thought that there was no real point to trying to collect the milk-how much could there be? Turns out that my non-nursing side was leaking nearly two ounces of breastmilk, which the Milk-Saver held with room to spare. Needless to say, I'm now a believer. $27.95. Buy it here.    Issue #4: So many bottles to wash--so little time!  Solution: Kiinde Twist I have a knack for doing things the hard way. Nursing was no exception. I would pump into one bottle, pour that bottle into a bag, and then pour that bag into a different bottle. Wash, rinse, boil, sanitize, pump, repeat. I found myself always scrambling to match bottles to lids to nipples, and it made pumping even more stressful for me. So, seeking to minimize the chaos, I came across the Kiinde Twist storage system. Kiinde seeks to minimize the transfer (and waste!) of breast milk through a collection, storage and feeding system. You pump directly into a bag, which then can be labeled and stored as is. The system includes a bottle warmer, which heats the milk to the right temperature, and then the same pouch can be snapped into a nipple and holder and used for feeding. It's a genius way to make sure every drop gets used, and to keep unnecessary dishes out of your sink. $31.99. Buy it here.    Issue #5: I'm going out. Where am I going to heat up a bottle?  Solution: Innobaby's warmers This one's a toughie, because the number one source of convenient heat (the microwave) is a no-no when it comes to heating breastmilk. Innobaby's warmers really shouldn't even be in the bottle warmer category-they're really portable space-age kitchens. Add a packet and a little hot water, and you have an on-the-go heat source that can be used to warm baby bottles, liquids and foods. I love the fact that there's no plug or battery required, and the heat time is pretty fast--less than two minutes! $36.95. Buy it here.

No no.&quot; You're thinking that your life has ended. That you just flushed the liquid asset of your independence down the toilet alongside the extra pee from your pregnancy test.   You're thinking of your friend that disappeared from all social contact when she reproduced. You're hearing the war cries of her three feral children in the background when you call her on the phone. She was going to become a doctor.  You're noticing parents in restaurants, watching them corral their toddler back into the booth for the sixth time while the baby throws food from the high chair. You watch it all and weep silently into your pasta. Is this really going to be your life? You do not want this to be your life.  You wanted to travel.  You wanted to get your master's.  You wanted that job.  Or maybe you really do want a baby, but now you're freaking out over the sheer enormity of new life gestating in your once-virgin uterus and you're calculating how old you'll be in 18 years when this eternal little being will go out into the world and you'll be independent again.  I wept in fear and surprise when I saw those two pink lines on a pregnancy test three years ago. So, too, did I think mournfully of my independence. I was 22 and barely out of college -- we'd only been married four months. We were going to travel the world! I was going to become a teacher! How could this happen? I panicked.  Probably you are panicking. Probably you will panic at various points throughout your pregnancy, or, like me, on a steady low simmer throughout the whole nine months. Maybe you're wondering if you are even cut out to be a mom. What if you don't love your baby? You don't even like cats! You kill all your plants!  I was terrified as I stared down the barrel of motherhood. Before my eyes sprang up a new world of misbehaving children and frazzled mothers. I went for dinner with a friend who had kids and cringed as they threw garlic bread at each other in a series of increasingly violent uprisings. A coworker brought her newborn in to work for a visit and I lurked near the photocopier as he spit up on everyone in the office. &quot;He only woke up three times last night,&quot; she beamed.  I can't do this, I thought. Parents are insane.  Then, one September day, I had my baby.   In a moment (give or take 8 hours of labour), I crossed over the other side into motherhood. And everything changed. You've heard this before, I know. Everything changed. It means nothing to you now. It will mean everything, though, once you are on the other side.  It's going to be fine. It will be better than fine, though you can't possibly know this now.  Here is what I learned on that morning three years ago. It's what every woman learns when she gives birth or signs those adoption papers or gets that custody. This is the secret, at once the most obvious and hidden: motherhood looks better from the inside.  There are many things about motherhood that you can see from the outside: tantrums and boogers and diapers and minivans. But, from the outside, you can't see the love. You can't see those silky, spiderweb, stronger-than-steel bonds of sheer adoration that bind those mothers to their babies like superglue. And how it makes them not only endure the tantrums and boogers and diapers and minivan, but do it all willingly, unthinkingly. Because all the fibers and filaments of love that once looped in steady strings around their own hearts have been flung out and away from their own beings and onto their children.  Holding my son for the first time, I could feel it -- those strands falling magnet-like from me to him, tethering us together. In the quiet hum of the hospital room, I looked down at the bundle in my arms and suddenly realized I was holding my own heart -- but now, infinitely more precious -- somehow beating and breathing outside of my body.  In that moment, and in many moments since then, I looked back at my terrified, pre-baby self with a fond sort of pity. What did I know? I knew nothing.  None of it makes sense to you now. You haven't crossed over yet. But while you're cringing at restaurant tantrums and your friend over-posting her daughter's first birthday on Instagram, just remember that this magic that has transformed other, saner people into doting parents will happen to you, too.   You're a skeptic still, I know. There's so much you wanted to do with your life. You wanted to make a difference.  You sweet, selfish thing. Do you know it yet, that this is what life is truly about? You, who has always spoken of changing the world and embracing the unknown and bettering yourself? You'd planned to do it in other ways, perhaps: to find yourself through travel or start an NGO or climb the corporate ladder or to forge ahead into the world with the blazing torch of your education or skill.   But here, instead it has come quietly to your door, as close and deep as your own heartbeat. Let yourself be stretched. Make room for life the way it has made room for you. Here it is -- your shortcut to the heart of life. Ask for the grace to bend -- if you stand rigid, life will surely break you. As your body stretches and grows, so, too, will you--in the fear and apprehension and loss of control as well as in the abundant joy and reward.  There is life -- vast, vibrant life -- during the season of babies. They tell me there is also life on the other side of children. Perhaps in a year, or ten, or twenty, you and I will go after that job or degree or travel adventure. It will still be there, waiting. And when we go, we will go as those who have made room for life. Who bear the indelible marks of sacrifice and love. Who have bent with awkward, fledgling grace and have allowed ourselves to be untied and stretched and transformed. (This is not a thinly veiled warning about stretch marks, although no promises.)  My son is now nearly three. He and his little brother are, of course, two of the very best things in my life. I won't say more -- until you're on the inside, any ruminations from a mother of two toddlers will surely only depress or bore you. If you're overwhelmed and afraid like I was, just keep your head down and avoid small children. Don't stare down the echoing hallway of 18 years. Don't weep about diapers or minivans. You don't have to make it 18 years. You only have to make it 9 months. The secret of motherhood will carry you from there.

Sure, we have the same rights as men, but there are so many double standards that are still applied to our lives. As mothers, we see it the most. There was a time where most families stayed together, the father worked outside of the home, and the mom stayed at home as a homemaker. The dad would take their sons hunting and fishing, and moms would teach their daughters how to cook and clean. Back then it was the norm, but that doesn't mean it's the right way.   We are just as able as dads are to do things like hunting, fishing, chasing career goals, and fixing things around the house, just as dads are capable of cooking, cleaning, and taking care of children. Families are less likely to stay together this day and age, so some moms (and dads) have to do it all on their own. It's time us moms realize that we are not confined to the kitchen, and we have so much more to offer our children when it comes to teaching them life lessons.   Believe it or not, but women like to go out in the woods and hunt just as much (if not more) as men do. I have to admit that I was always afraid of shooting a gun, but I loved to go out and watch for deer with my family. My family lives off of venison, so hunting is extremely important to us. Guns scared me because of the danger, the loud noises, and fear of missing my target, but those are common concerns. The important thing is to get educated about your gun, practice in a safe environment, and wear the correct ear protection. Hunting isn't just for the guys anymore, ask any girl out there that comes from a small town.   When I became a mother, that is what I defined myself as. I would've gladly given up every other aspect of myself to cater to my son, if I had the chance. In this economy, I couldn't afford to stay home with my son, given my tens of thousands owed towards student loans. I feel bad all the time for working, and so do many other moms. The question is, why? Why don't dads feel as bad as we do for leaving our children 40 hours a week (or more)? Many women feel very passionately about the path they have chosen in life, and they want to have a career, too. Why does society tell us that we are selfish for doing that? Why do we have to live with the guilt and shame for following our dreams, while teaching our children to do the same? It isn't right.   Now that many moms work outside of the home as well, it would make sense that the housework would be split evenly between mom and dad, right? Sadly, wrong. Many men are stuck in the &quot;old days&quot; way of thinking, and expect women to do the housework and cook supper, while also feeding, bathing and getting the kids put to bed. When both parents are working full time, it isn't fair to dump everything else on mom. I'd like to think that we are superheroes, but no one should have to have so much on their plates. Sharing the housework and showing appreciation when moms go above and beyond go a long way.   It's no surprise that females are a force to be reckoned with. We can spend all night cleaning up puke while comforting sick kids, wake up in the morning and spend all day at work like its nothing. We can do anything that dads can do, and we should kick those outdated standards to the curb. Moms are the ones getting the short end of the stick when we are expected to live up to these expectations every day. So ladies, let your husbands do the dishes and cook supper, and don't be afraid to show your kids how to bait a hook. We are all equally able to do anything we want, regardless of gender. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

As a nutritionist and recipe developer, I love checking out what fresh findings are available at my local grocery store, like ALDI, to get inspired. Here are 10 clever ideas you should try that are taking the food world by storm.   Toast 2.0  FSerega via Getty Images  You already know about avocado toast. But how about Radish Cucumber Toast? Or Blueberry Ricotta Toast? Photos of piled-high toasts are becoming the newest form of food fixation on social media. They also happen to make extremely healthy, filling meals and snacks! Start by smearing a piece of sturdy, toasted bread with a soft spread like ricotta, butter or even mashed peas, then layer on thinly sliced veggies, fruit, a sprinkling of herbs or seeds, and a drizzle of nut butter or shake of spice.   Spiralized Veggies  Westend61 via Getty Images  If you haven't jumped on the spiralized veggies craze yet, now is the perfect time, with seasonal produce plentiful and affordable. Why should you try it? Spiralized veggies can stand in for pasta, significantly boosting your veggie servings (most people have woefully low intakes) and cutting serious calories. Try this Greek Chicken Zoodle Salad, this Mediterranean Zucchini Pasta Salad or these Spiralized Summer Roll Bowls. If you just want to dip your toe in, make this Spaghetti and Spiralized Zucchini with Lemon Pesto.  Vegetarian 'Steaks'  Jonathan Kantor via Getty Images  Meat eaters aren't the only ones flipping steaks on the grill. Plant-based eating is hot, and recipes are springing up that make veggies the satisfying star of the meal. Think thick cuts of veggies like cauliflower, butternut squash, and broccoli grilled up and eaten with a fork and knife. Try these Grilled Portobello Steaks with Avocado Chimichurri.  Watermelon, Reimagined  mphillips007 via Getty Images  Watermelon alone practically screams summer, but now it's being reworked in all kinds of new formats beyond the humble melon wedge or ball. Lovers of the pink fruit pair it with soft cheese, like in these Watermelon, Basil and Feta Bites, serve it on toasted baguette slices, such as in this Watermelon Bruschetta, and even cook on the grill for this Grilled Watermelon Salad.  Smoothie Bowls  Westend61 via Getty Images  The smoothie bowl trend shows no sign of stopping, and the abundance of fresh summer fruits only broaden the possibilities. The base of these bowls is a smoothie thick enough to stand up to a spoon (use frozen fruit, yogurt and chia seeds to bulk it up). Then that base is adorned with slices of fruit, a handful of nuts or seeds, and a drizzle of honey or nut butter. Try this Peach, Raspberry and Spinach Smoothie Bowl to get you started (and hooked).   Fruit-Infused Water  Image: MAIKA 777 via Getty Images  Skip pricey bottled fruit water and make your own at home with a mason jar and fresh produce. Simply pack fruits, veggies and herbs into cold water and allow to steep. The result is a refreshing beverage with a light, subtle flavor -- minus the excessive sugar and calories in summer drinks like lemonade and sweet tea. Try combos like watermelon + mint, cucumber + orange, grapefruit + rosemary, or strawberry + lemon + basil. Get a full primer on making infused waters, including some important do's and don'ts, here.  Upgraded Potato Salad  Ray Kachatorian via Getty Images  That gelatinous dish your Aunt Midge brought to every potluck has got nothing on today's updated versions of the classic potato salad. Interesting flavors and unexpected ingredients are at the heart of these new spins, like this Easy Vegan German Potato Salad or this Cilantro Jalapeño Potato Salad.  Unique Ice Pop Flavors  Image: SuzanaMarinkovic via Getty Images  If you're not quite ready for savory ice pops (think Mark Bittman's Avocado-Cilantro Ice Pops), there are plenty of recipes that keep the sweetness but add veggies, herbs or spices, like these Mango Chile Limon Paletas or these Basil Lemon Popsicles.   No-Waste Recipes  Courtesy of Veggies Don't Bite  Combatting food waste is on so many minds (and blogs) these days -- and for good reason: One-third of all food produced gets wasted! Fresh summer produce should be savored -- or at least saved. In order to take full advantage of summer's seasonal fruits and veggies, try zero-waste recipes for a delicious and eco-friendly meal, from these No Bake Energy Bars to this Easy Teriyaki Rice Bowl With Roasted Vegetables.  Whipping up summer's top food trends featuring garden-fresh, seasonal produce is simpler and more economical than you'd think thanks to ALDI. The grocery store you know and love from its more than 1,500 nationwide locations is now providing Southern California shoppers with a wide variety of organic fruits, vegetables and locally grown produce at an affordable price. Use the ripe offerings from ALDI to test top culinary trends this summer without breaking the bank.

Unlike her baby sister, Portia, who was born a champion nurser, Hermione and I fought hard for our beautiful nursing relationship. Through four brutal weeks of an undiagnosed tongue tie, she couldn't latch and would just scream and scream. But we fought to make it work. I would try and unsuccessfully nurse her and then pump and give her a bottle. This cycle would then repeat every two hours -- for four weeks. Finally, we figured out the problem and got it fixed, and she finally latched on and nursed like a pro. I returned the rented pump, gave away the bottles, and never looked back.  After enduring such an emotional and exhausting start to our nursing relationship, I was in no rush to give it up. I loved nursing Hermione and was sure she would still be nursing as a two or three year old, and I would have been more than fine with that.  After she hit about 15 months, she was only nursing three times a day (down from almost ten at its height): in the morning, after her nap, and in the bath before bed. If she was sick or hurt, she would nurse more. I loved always being a source of instant warmth and comfort for her. I loved nursing her in the middle of the night if she woke up and needed me. Sitting in the rocking chair, snuggling with my sweet baby girl and feeling like the only two people in the world, will always be my happy place. The smell of her hair, her little hands waving around and stroking my face, the sweet way she would say, &quot;milkies please, Mommy&quot; -- I loved and cherished every second of nursing my first baby girl.  And then one day, after 20 beautiful months, she was done. There was no gradual process. I had no idea it was coming.  Hermione woke up from her nap, as she always did, calling for me: &quot;Milkies please, Mommy! Milkies please, Mommy!&quot; I went into her  room and got ready to nurse. But this time, as I pulled down my shirt, she started to freak out. She screamed and cried for a while, and no snuggling or cuddling seemed to make her feel better. I realized then that she wasn't going to nurse. It took 15 long minutes, her favorite green juice and a little help from Sesame Street for her to eventually calm down.  At bath time that night, it happened again. Instead of grabbing me in the tub and nursing for 15-20 minutes, she just stared at me and said &quot;fix it.&quot; Fix what? I still had plenty of milk and was confused and saddened  about what she thought might be broken. I tried to convince her to latch on as she was clearly agitated and upset, but she simply wouldn't. It was as if she had forgotten how. The whole scene felt very similar to when she was a tiny newborn and wanted desperately to nurse but just couldn't figure out the physicality of it.  The next morning she woke up asking for mommy's milkies again.  But again, she wouldn't nurse and got terribly upset when I offered it to her. The same thing happened after nap time, and again in the bath before bed.  She was done. Despite asking for milk something in her little body was telling her it was over, that she couldn't nurse anymore.  My heart was breaking. If she had seemed happy and not conflicted about her decision, the shock might have been lessened for me. But her inner turmoil was sad and confusing. For the past 20 months, I had met her tears and cries with nursing, and suddenly that no longer worked.  Aside from the emotional shock at the sudden loss of our sweet nursing bond, my body had already started to react physically to this change. My breasts were very sore and engorged  -- as they once were, right after Hermione's birth. My hormones were on a roller coaster ride as they adjusted to not creating or sustaining a baby for the first time in 30 months. I cried randomly. I felt emotionally exposed and raw all over. All eerily similar to the immediate weeks postpartum.  In my head, I knew that breastfeeding Hermione for 20 months was a huge accomplishment. We did it, without pumping or bottles, until she no longer needed it for nutrition or physical comfort. We ended on her terms, as sudden as they may have been.  Once I realized this wasn't a nursing strike and it was really over, the challenge was to create new routines to occupy the time we would have spent nursing. How would I comfort her when she was upset? How would I gently soothe her when she woke up cranky from a nap? It took a long time for Hermione to wake up without screaming and crying. Now she is almost three and a half and simply wakes up and runs into my bedroom, overjoyed to see me and start her day. Most mornings, I am nursing her baby sister in bed when she comes to greet us. She always asks, &quot;what's Portia doing Mommy?&quot; It's amazing how quickly they forget.  Our intimate, beautiful nursing relationship may have ended sooner than I had hoped, but I know those 20 months bonded us in ways we might never fully understand. Even if she is no longer growing in or being sustained by my body, she is still my baby. I her mommy. Her weaning led me to appreciate each snuggle, kiss and hug that much more. More so than any other milestones, it made me acutely aware of how fast children grow up. My baby is now turning into a big girl before my eyes, and it is the most beautiful, exquisite pain there is.  Photo courtesy of Sarah Jane Mercer.

Mom shaming is rampant -- made worse by the constant comparisons brought to our doorsteps every moment by social media. Moms are unrealistically expected to perform to the highest standards at work and at home. The pressure to achieve the Fabulous Facebook life and Pinterest Perfection is exhausting and excessive.   We need to look at Moms and Moms need to look at themselves through a new prism. It's a good time for new strategies to tap into, not tune out, our emotional needs by decoding the inner dialogue inside our heads.  In my new book arriving in September, Organize Your Emotions, Optimize Your Life, which I co-authored with Harvard Medical School professor Edward Phillips, M.D., and veteran journalist John Hanc, we propose an approach to the human psyche that is basically an adult version of the Oscar-winning Pixar movie, Inside Out, positing that we have an inner family of nine life forces each with unique agendas, voices, and emotions. Let's use this model to go inside - to identify, decode, assess the mind's inner dialogue to better understand what Moms are dealing with, and help them find the path to a more sane, happier and healthier place.   Of the nine, let's take a look first at the dominant part Moms are dealing with, the Standard Setter, which has the job of setting the bar for achievement and self-worth. It tracks external standards too to make sure we make the grade and get respect and validation. It's the part that asks the question &quot;am I good enough, smart enough, fast enough, productive enough, attractive enough. Am I a good enough mom??&quot; You get the picture. There is nothing wrong with the drive to perform well, meet others' standards, and earn respect from ourselves and others. It's natural and normal and healthy. However, the Standard Setter's agenda of meeting internal and external performance standards is only one agenda of being human. Let's consider eight other agendas that all together provide more balance, wisdom, and thriving.   #2. Autonomy focuses on self-determination as psychologists call it, being the master of one's destiny, marching to one's drummer and being authentic by living life according to one's heartfelt values. Autonomy is a fierce drive in humans, perhaps the fiercest, and at its most energetic, and often angry, it drives uprisings and revolutions. In the movie &quot;Bad Moms,&quot; the lead Amy and her two friends rebel vigorously against the perfect mom clique whose expectations are beyond realistic. &quot;I've had enough&quot; of these externally-imposed standards and &quot;I'm not taking it anymore&quot; is the voice of Autonomy.  &nbsp; #3. Confidence is concerned with being strong, competent, and confident. That includes competence in mothering - raising healthy, happy, and resilient kids who go on to live lives worth living. In the &quot;Bad Moms&quot; scenario, Confidence is feeling both defeated by standards that are out of reach, while resisting the external definition of competence of mothers which seems to be driven by social norms and not by what is truly good for raising strong and competent kids. Confidence is cheering on the rebellious Autonomy: &quot;Let's focus on the true nature of good mothering and ignore the social pressures that are blowing us of course.&quot;  #4 is the Body Regulator, which is focused on health, balance, and physical energy, and sees that the social norms of mothering are harming the health of Moms by creating chronic stress and overwhelm, and leaving no time for Moms' self-care. How can Moms be good role models of healthy balance for their kids when being a Mom is more focused on social standards than human thriving? The Body Regulator is thrilled by the uprising to reclaim balance and reasonable standards. Go team go! Just don't overdo the junk food and partying...  #5 is the Relational. It lives to serve others--to nurture, give care, love, and to be a great Mom. The Relational wants kids to flourish and grow into healthy adults and even help other Moms be great Moms. It senses that while some of the external standards are helpful, others have more to do with social respect and social acceptance than the flourishing of children. 'Let's hear what our other voices have to say about how to help kids flourish most.&quot;  #6 is the Curious Adventurer, whose need for novelty and adventure is what drives children to explore, learn, and grow. It's a life force that gets tempered-- if not squashed--by adult rules and standards. It's time for Moms take a page from their children's curiosity and ask beginner's mind questions, e.g. &quot;What really and truly makes a great Mom? How can I grow into a better Mom?&quot; Moms can bring to more moments a childlike spirit of adventure - what's new, what's interesting, what's fun, what's there to learn?  Meet #7, the Creative who loves fun and pleasure, playing games and inventing new stuff. It's the generative part of your personality. It comes naturally to kids, like breathing. By the time we reach adulthood our daily quotient of creative activity can drop or nearly disappear; we forget to have fun and be inventive. The &quot;Bad Moms&quot; discover that having fun with their kids is fun and energizing for them too. A whole lot better than worrying about baking the perfect cookies is having fun with your kids making a mess baking cookies, even inventing a new recipe.    For #8 we bring on the Executive Manager: the inner planner and organizer, whose job it is to get places on time, and navigate the daily to-do list. It's typically overwhelmed and exhausted by the strains of reaching for perfection. Now that the energetic spirits of the Adventurer and Creative are online, it enjoys more that role of Mom to provide some order, structure and discipline just-in-time -- as needed and not all day long.   Finally we meet #9, the Meaning Maker. This part of our personality stands back, makes sense and meaning, and integrates all of the other perspectives into a coherent perspective. It's the inner coach, nudging us to find the wisdom needed for this moment.   Here's its wisdom for Moms today:  1.	Appreciate the Standard Setter for its healthy drive to meet internal and external standards, and then ask it to step aside to allow the other life forces say what they need to say. 2.	Give Autonomy the internal steering wheel, not handing it over to the social clique of perfect Moms. 3.	Help Confidence define an internal standard for competence and strength in being a Mom. 4.	Listen to the Body Regulator and find time for a little self-care and balance. 5.	Honor the Relational to tune into what kids really need to flourish and be resilient when things don't go well. 6.	Tap into the Curious Adventurer to see every moment with a fresh, open mind as a new exploration and an opportunity to learn. 7.	Unleash the Creative to simply have fun and invent stuff with your kids a good deal of the time. 8.	Bring in the Executive Manager to provide just the right dose of order and discipline while not squashing adventure and fun. 9.	Slow down to tune into the Meaning Maker to experience the miracle of how kids grow and change, and feel gratitude for sharing their journey to adulthood. You could even help children tune into their own nine life forces too!

What's the biggest risk to your financial plan? MarketWatch mentions shortfall risk, the possibility that &quot;you won't have enough money to make your goals.&quot; CNN Money talks about investment risk, which you're probably familiar with; CNN defines it as &quot;the extent to which an investment's price or returns bounce up and down.&quot; Take a look in the newspaper and you might find a million other political risks: Brexit, for example, or a feeling of unease over who might be elected in the fall.  But one of the biggest risks is never mentioned in these articles and is rarely discussed in much detail: What happens if you don't live to see your financial plan through?  All investments - whether it's for retirement, a college savings plan, or in your home - require time. The concept of &quot;compounding,&quot; whether it be in compound interest or compound gains from your investment, is based entirely around how much time you have to invest. That's why most financial experts suggest that you start investing as soon as possible - usually by age 25.  &quot;If you're saving for retirement, there are really only three things that can happen to your savings,&quot; says Brian Grimes, CFP, a Senior Client Services Manager at PolicyGenius. &quot;You either end up with more money than you put in, less money than you put in, or about the same amount. But all three of these outcomes operate under the assumption that you don't pass away prematurely.&quot;  You might be thinking that that's a little depressing, but stick with me.  Dying prematurely is not only emotionally devastating to your family, but it's financially devastating as well, touching on every major aspect of your financial plan. It's a simple fact that, if you die, your income will no longer be available to your family. You probably already know this, but it's worth repeating: your income is a crucial part of your personal and family budget, which is the foundation of your family's financial plan.  Your income and family budget directly feed into two other major pillars of your financial plan: long-term financing (mortgage, car loan) and investments (college savings, retirement, estate planning). &quot;The purpose of financial planning, at its purest level, is to generate a plan that will grow a nest egg of money that you can use to pay off all of your debt obligations and support you indefinitely without you having to work,&quot; says Grimes. If you die prematurely, you won't be able to fulfill that main objective of financial planning.  If you die at any point before your financial plan is complete - whether that be saving for retirement, college, paying off a big debt like a mortgage, or some combination of all three plus other goals and obligations - those goals remain incomplete. Your family will need to find another way to complete your financial plan without your income. &quot;If you die young, your family is potentially losing your peak earning working years - your forties, your fifties,&quot; says Grimes.  The backup plan for your financial goals  Insurance is an important and often forgotten component of your financial plan that's just as crucial as your investments or mortgage.  You probably already have insurance - health insurance, car insurance, etc. - but there's only one type of insurance that protects your family in the event that you die: life insurance.  Life insurance can be a very simple product. For pure protection, you're going to want to look specifically at term life insurance. The other major type of life insurance - called permanent life insurance - is an entirely different beast. The most common type of permanent life insurance, whole life insurance, attempts to be both a savings or investment vehicle and an insurance product. While this is useful for some consumers with high incomes and more complicated financial plans, it's not the best solution for most Americans who just need affordable life insurance.  Term life insurance, on the other hand, is often referred to as &quot;pure&quot; life insurance because, like other insurance products, it has a single objective: protect against a high-impact risk. Unlike permanent life insurance, term life insurance lasts for a specific &quot;term&quot; of time, typically for ten, twenty, or thirty years. You pay a monthly premium - $500,000 of coverage for a twenty-year term will cost around $30 per month for a healthy male in their mid-30s - and, in return, your survivors will receive a tax-free lump sum of money if you die during the term.  This lump sum of money can be used for anything, but for most families, it's intended to act as a backup for your financial goals. Let's walk through an example.  Say you're saving up for your daughter's college education. You've been saving for two years now, but you estimate you still have another sixteen years to go until you have enough to cover her entire college tuition. You buy a life insurance policy with enough coverage that your spouse will be able to fill up the savings account if you die. You sign the papers and then you die the next day. Thanks to the life insurance policy, your spouse can complete your financial goal, despite your death and the loss of those crucial working years.    Brian Grimes calls life insurance a &quot;self-completing financial product.&quot; Why? Because you get that full amount no matter when during the policy you pass away. It does not require time to build up, unlike your retirement or college savings goals. &quot;There's no other financial product that does this,&quot; Grimes says.  According to Grimes, using life insurance this way specifically protects the &quot;accumulation phase&quot; of your financial plan. That's the period before you've finished your retirement savings, when you're still working and accumulating wealth. This is another reason that using term life insurance makes sense - you buy it for a period of time when the risk of not completing your financial goals is the highest and you stop paying for it once you no longer need that safety net.  But life insurance isn't just used to complete savings or investments; it can also be used to protect your family from debt. Mortgages are one of the longest and most expensive debts that a family will take on, and many families need two incomes to pay off a mortgage and not feel stressed about it. Amelia Tyagi, co-author of The Two-Income Trap, told Mother Jones that &quot;[w]e tend to assume families with two incomes [are] doubly secure. But if you count on every penny of both of those incomes, which most families today do, then you're in big trouble if either income goes away.&quot;  Luckily, life insurance can take care of mortgages in much the same way it takes care of savings goals.    We've talked to a lot of people who are confused about the true nature of life insurance. Part of that has to do with the name - people may understand that life insurance pays out a benefit if they die, but they may not make the connection as to why.  So think of it this way: the same way that car insurance is a safety net for your car, home insurance is a safety net for your home, or health insurance is a safety net for your health, life insurance is a safety net for your financial plan. It's the easiest, cheapest, and best way to mitigate the risk that you won't have time to complete your financial plan.  ***  PolicyGenius is rethinking insurance from the consumer's perspective - because it's about time somebody did.

I had a baby. I spent six blissful months at home with her. I returned to work. I hated it and cried myself to sleep every single night. I became a stay-at-home mom again. I built my own business from my home office. Which propelled me back into full-time working mom mode more quickly than you can say &quot;there are not enough hours in the day.&quot;  Only now, things are a bit different. I am not working for another company or large corporation. I am working for myself. I launched my own business. It's doing pretty well, if I do say so myself. But all of the pressure is on my shoulders. No one is handing me a biweekly paycheck. No one has offered to foot the bill for my health insurance like back in the day. If I don't hustle, I don't make money -- end of story.   But if I don't also commit a pretty solid amount of time in my day to my daughter, none of the money is even worth it. So what's a girl do to? Drive herself nuts? Kind of -- but a good kind of nuts. An empowered sort of crazy. The kind that comes with finally getting a grip on life, finding a way to stay organized, and tackle all of your daily challenges with a smile on your face (even if it's a fake one). Because it's all part of the process - and you can't really figure it out until you've been faced with the hell that is a cancelled babysitter twenty minutes before one the biggest meetings of your career.  That's right, I have somehow found how to combine being a #bossbabe with being a #bossmom, which in its own right, is a marriage of sorts. And lord if it isn't as difficult as the other kind of marriage (you know I'm right). Because in all honesty, the real secret to the finding your success in working mom life is the same one that comes from marriage...  Say it with me now ... COMPROMISE.  For example -- I often compromise my nightly television time to fit in the work I put aside when my daughter gets home from her half-day at camp. That way, all of my attention can be focused on her until she goes to sleep, and then I can delve guiltlessly back into my work.   It's hard. Sometimes my body is just screaming out for some horizontal Housewives of New Jersey television time. But sometimes, it's a matter of taking a step back and figuring out what will make you feel the most accomplished tomorrow. What will take a little bit of the load off of your overfilled plate. What will help you lay your head on your pillow at night feeling as if you did the best you could -- for your child AND your business.  Aside from compromise on all levels, here are my tips for working moms to feel like they are winning at life.  5. Ask for help. 	The second any mother realizes that they would be just a little bit better off with an extra set of hands, is the day your life will change. I'm not saying go out and hire a full-time nanny - though sometimes I wish I could. But know who you can count on and call upon in those moments of despair, when your sitter cancels on you last minute and your make-or-break business meeting is just minutes away. If you are in a marriage or relationship with another adult under your roof, be open to asking for certain blocks of time where you can use two hands on your laptop, without a child trying to bang away on your keyboard (I speak from experience).  4.	Get Organized 	Whether it's a regular old paper-and-pen to-do list or a whiteboard tacked up on your fridge, make a commitment to getting organized. Spend some time at the end of the weekend allotting just enough work time to hit your deadlines or goals, and plan out the kid's schedule as well. If your job regularly involves time with clients, or scheduled conference calls, make sure to set blocks of time aside (with room for error) to take care of these needs instead of scattering appointments throughout your day. The day I began limiting my meetings to two days per week and allotting the rest of my time for actual work, my life changed, my afternoons magically lightened up for my child, and I felt more accomplished over all.  3. Have a sense of humor! 	...and be realistic. There are days that will you feel as if you are walking on water. Days where your accomplishments will come coupled with a hair flip and a finger snap. And days where you'll feel like a failure. And want to cry. And throw in the towel. And just say screw it and crawl into your child's IKEA tent with a bowl of goldfish and sing the ABC's over and over again (like I said, I speak from experience). But if you can't have a sense of humor about the very-skilled dance you have begun to do, then it will be a much rougher road for you. Learn to laugh at yourself. Learn to grow from your mistakes. Don't take yourself too seriously. And don't be afraid to ensure yourself that tomorrow will be a better day.  2. Just say no. 	The first thing any working mother realizes once they enter their new world of too many responsibilities, is that if you think you can tackle every single thing, you will quickly burn out. Don't be afraid to say no to plans that make you feel overwhelmed or will infringe on the great work flow you've got going at that moment. Don't be hesitant to blow off a playdate to spend some quality one-on-one time with your children. Don't be afraid to say no - to anyone, at anytime. Know your limits, and set your boundaries.   1. Make time for YOU. Just like they tell us on the airplane, in case of emergency, put the air mask on yourself before attempting to help anyone else. As mother's we all know that the bulk of the daily responsibilities and burdens that come with taking care of a home and children tend to fall more or our shoulders than anyone else's. Throw a job into the mix and it can sometimes feel like it's hard to breathe. But you have to breathe -- because if you run out of steam, how can you give to anyone else?   When you organize your calendar for the week, make sure you set aside a chunk of time every week that is dedicated solely to yourself. Read a new book. Call an old friend. Heck, get a freakin' manicure. You've earned it mama.   &quot;Definitely schedule that 'me' time in,&quot; suggests Emily Kapit, a 3X Certified Master Resume Writer, the head of ReFresh Your Step, a career advisory firm, as well as mom to a toddler. &quot;It's so easy to allow yourself to get lost in the haze of running a company and handling kids. You, your business, and your children will thrive when you give yourself a much-needed timeout.&quot;  Because you're a working mom, and you're already winning at life.

Health experts continue to voice concerns over the upcoming Olympics due to the Zika outbreak, a disease that causes babies to be born with smaller heads and brains that aren’t fully developed. But amid that crisis, Brazil is being heralded as a pioneer for the innovative way it has substantially increased breastfeeding rates and reduced its child mortality rates by 73 percent&nbsp;from 1990 to last year.&nbsp; A recent study from the Lancet, a U.K. medical journal, found that if breastfeeding rates reached near universal levels, 823,000 deaths of children under 5 could be prevented every year due to the fact that the practice protects against a number of serious health conditions. &nbsp; Despite such evidence, only 35 percent of mothers worldwide in 2013 exclusively breastfed their babies for the first six months of life, as the World Health Organization recommends.  An inability to produce enough milk, work conflicts, cultural pressure, a lack of education on the topic and other issues, keep moms from breastfeeding their babies in both low- and high-income countries, according to the Lancet report. But Brazil has devised an effective method to educate mothers and make it easier for them to breastfeed their babies. That kind of programming is being linked to its significant drop in child mortality rates, according to the Brazilian Human Milk Banks Network and Ministry of Health of Brazil. Part of what distinguishes Brazil from other countries is that is has the most human milk banks. Of the 292 human milk banks in the world, 220 of them are based in Brazil.  Human milk banks enable mothers to donate their breast milk in a safe and convenient way so that babies in need can access it. Milk banks cater to babies who were born premature, underweight, severely malnourished, or have been orphaned, according to PATH, a nonprofit that focuses on improving the health and wellbeing of women and children.&nbsp; Delaying breastfeeding at birth can have severe consequences. According to UNICEF, it increases risks of newborn death by 80 percent.&nbsp; Those who can donate, call the bank when they’re ready to give and a delivery service picks up the milk and preserves it with special cooling systems until it arrives at the bank, according to UNICEF.&nbsp; But scaling up human milk banks in poor countries has been a major challenge because of the painstaking steps involved in the process. To ensure that donated milk doesn’t carry HIV or other pathogens, human milk banks have to pasteurize the donated milk. Brazil launched its milk bank network in 1998 and in the last decade nearly 2 million babies have received human milk through it. Exclusive breastfeeding rates have also soared in Brazil, due to the growing breast milk network and other encouraging initiatives. In 1986,&nbsp;2 percent of infants under 6 months were exclusively breastfed. By 2006, that figure climbed to 39 percent,&nbsp;according to the Brazilian Human Milk Banks Network and Ministry of Health of Brazil.  The South America country has also helped boost the practice through its paid maternity leave and by rigorously monitoring the formula industry. The country regulates the marketing of breast milk substitutes to preclude the industry from influencing breastfeeding moms. Brazil hopes to promote its breast milk bank model at the upcoming Nutrition for Growth event on Aug. 4. UN organizations, government leaders and advocates from the UK and Japan will convene in Rio de Janeirno to learn about effective child nutrition programs and policies and how to implement them.&nbsp; Women who have been able to take advantage of the milk bank say they’re grateful for the opportunity, and hope to be able to return the favor. When Paula Nunes’ daughter, Alice Maria, was born premature in 2013, Nunes wasn’t able to produce enough milk for her daughter. She visited the bank at the Cesar Cals Hospital in Fortaleza, Brazil where she was able to get donated milk to supplement her own and learn how to feed her baby through a tube, according to UNICEF. “I have enough breast milk to feed my baby in the daytime. But sometimes, at night, I don’t seem able to produce enough milk, and that’s when my baby can benefit from the women who have donated to the milk bank,” she told UNICEF. “I feel so blessed that, as soon as I can produce extra milk, I will be sure to donate it to help other mothers like me.” -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.
