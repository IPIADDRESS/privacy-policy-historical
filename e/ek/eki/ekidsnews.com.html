She searched far and wide for pregnancy books that focused on the woman’s journey, rather than the birth itself, and couldn’t find anything. “All the books out there focused on the birth or the baby, or how to be healthy, but I didn’t feel like there was anything that spoke to the pregnancy journey of a woman,” Daulter told The Huffington Post. Daulter decided to write the book herself. Sacred Pregnancy&nbsp;was published in 2012 and has since given rise to what she calls the&nbsp;“Sacred Living Movement&quot; -- a website, retreat series and lifestyle concept. The movement celebrated its third anniversary on Nov. 2. “The Sacred Living Movement is a tonic to the mundane existence we’re used to living in,” Daulter said. Sacred Living encompasses dozens of trainings and retreats on topics like “sacred fertility,” “sacred relationships,” and of course, the trademark “sacred pregnancy” class. “This movement and all of our classes and retreats really inspire folks to look a little deeper, live in more conscious awareness -- what I call divine mind -- and bring them to a deep drink of their life,” Daulter said. “Once that spark gets lit,” she added, “it’s really difficult to turn it off.” Daulter and the other retreat facilitators bring about this shift with a touch of what she called “magic and mystery.” They use imagery and language that invite women -- and in some cases men -- to see the beauty in everyday life. Throughout her book, for example, Daulter sprinkles in beautiful photographs of pregnant women to challenge the images of pain and distress often associated with birth.&nbsp;  The retreats also incorporate activities that allow the women to “witness” one another in a safe and loving environment. In the “heart to heart” exercise, women pair up and place their hands on one another’s hearts. They then gaze into one another’s eyes for the length of an entire song, feeling whatever emotions arise as they relax into that vulnerable space. The popularity of Sacred Pregnancy and the Sacred Living Movement signals that “feminine consciousness is bubbling” and gaining momentum, Daulter said. Those seeking a framework for such awareness need not look far, with an increasing number of women’s spirituality degree programs, goddess-centered faith movements and women’s retreats taking place around the globe.&nbsp;  For Daulter, the sacred pregnancy concept is “the foundation” for a shift in women’s consciousness -- from competition to sisterhood, self-doubt to self-love, and finally to confidence. It’s the place in which “we’re able to birth new things,” she said. One midwife who attended Daulter’s sacred pregnancy retreat in October said she felt the experience had revitalized her work. In her testimonial, the woman said she had discovered a newfound faith in “strong empowered females who can be nurtured through love and understanding to birth their babies gently, consciously and above all without fear.” All of the tools women learn in the sacred pregnancy retreats equip them to step into motherhood in a conscious way, Daulter said. Birth is sacred, she said, but it is just one moment in time. From there, women must evaluate what kind of parent they want to be and what they hope the next phase of life will hold for them.  To that end, Daulter said two more Sacred Living books are scheduled for publication in 2016. The first is an exploration of sacred motherhood, and next is a book on natural healing practices for families. As the Sacred Living Movement grows, Daulter said she hopes society will begin to shift toward greater respect for pregnancy as a sacred journey in a woman’s life. If it does, the effect would ripple for generations. “It changes the kids, changes the babies, changes their experiences of coming into the world, and that affects their own destiny,” Daulter said. “I see it as having a huge effect.” Also on HuffPost: -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

When Nathan Bradley of the Georgia State Patrol arrived at the scene of a car wreck on Saturday, he discovered that Donald and Crystal Howard, who had been out buying face paint and candy for their kids for Halloween, had died in the crash. The state trooper went to the Howards' home address with the county deputy and deputy coroner to break the news. But when he showed up, he was greeted by four kids, ages 6-14, all in costume -- a sight that left him speechless, BuzzFeed reported.&nbsp; He was able to contact the kids' grandmother, Stephanie Oliver, who needed to drive from Florida to take custody of them. Because the grandmother had to travel for several hours before she could reach them, they would have to stay in county jail until she arrived -- something that, Bradley said, did not sit well with him.&nbsp; &quot;I immediately fell ill,&quot; he wrote in a&nbsp;Facebook post.&nbsp;&quot;Not only would these children discover they lost both parents, but would spend their Halloween in a county jail until somebody could tend to them; it just wasn't right.&quot;  After speaking with his colleagues and with Oliver's permission, Bradley volunteered to temporarily care for the children and made the decision to wait on delivering the news of their parents' deaths until their grandmother arrived. He took the kids to McDonald's and Burger King&nbsp;and bought them dinner.&nbsp;After Bradley brought the kids back to his patrol post, and his corporal showed up with his family bearing movies, popcorn and candy. They watched &quot;Monster House&quot; together, and residents who had heard about the accident came by to give the children goody bags filled with toys and candy. They ended their night tucked into beds at the patrol station.&nbsp; The children's grandmother arrived early the following morning to tell them about what had happened to their parents and assume custody of the kids. Before the family left the station, Bradley gave the oldest son his phone number so the teen would be able to reach out to him for support. Since the accident, the trooper has continued to take interest in the children, setting up a GoFundMe&nbsp;campaign to cover funeral costs and expenses related to the kids' educations. In about two days, people across the Internet contributed more than&nbsp;$231,000 to the fund.&nbsp; The kids will now be living with their grandmother who expressed her appreciation for Bradley's actions.&nbsp; &quot;He took care of my kids when they needed them,&quot; Oliver told 11Alive. &quot;He was there for them, all the way.&quot; To learn more about the Howards or to donate to the GoFundMe, visit the fundraising page here.&nbsp; &nbsp; Also on HuffPost:&nbsp;  -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

The video for the track --- off her forthcoming album &quot;This Is Acting&quot; -- features 9-year-old Mahiro Takano, a Japanese mixed martial artist, actor and dancer. According to Entertainment Weekly, Sia got in touch with Takano after seeing her popular videos on YouTube. One clip in particular of Takano practicing Kankudai became a viral sensation back in 2014, raking in close to 5 million views. Takano is not the first highly skilled child to jump to new levels of fame after appearing in a Sia music video.&nbsp;Thirteen-year-old dancer and actor Maddie Ziegler, who first entered the pop culture landscape on the hit reality show &quot;Dance Moms,&quot; gained widespread acclaim after starring in the 2014 video for Sia's &quot;Chandelier&quot; &quot;(which currently has over 965 million views on YouTube).

You weren't expecting me so soon and didn't notice when I came upon you and your friends playing together on the big, grassy lawn outside the pool.  I stood there watching as each of you took turns demonstrating your cartwheels for the other. With the sun setting behind you and your wet hair whipping around, I felt a smile spread across my face as you flipped your body this way and that, jumping for joy, and squealing in delight.  Seeing you there, so free and comfortable in your own skin, made me wish I could somehow hold at bay all the messages that I know are coming your way.  You see, while you already know that pink is for girls and blue is for boys, and that your friend Chloe would rather have a Barbie while Jack wants Spiderman, you haven't yet realized -- or even become aware of -- all that our culture has to say about how your body should look or what its shape says about you.  The other day, as I held your sweet, soft, little hand in mine at the supermarket, instead of cursing them like I usually do, I found myself silently thanking the Kit-Kat bars and the Reese's peanut butter cups that lined the checkout. To your 8-year-old eyes, they were far more appealing and interesting than the sea of the magazines that surrounded us, each asserting what you and I should want for our bodies:  Sculpt Tighter Abs by Summer Attack Cellulite and Makeover Your Thighs Look Hot From Behind  My precious girl, I started out just like you. My body was not even a thought. It was simply the thing that allowed me to play tag and hide and seek with my friends, to swim until my fingers shriveled and my hair turned green, to ride my bike until the moon came out, and to race with my older brother and his friends to prove my worth.  At some point, though, that all changed. When I was only a few years older than you, I bought into everything that society was selling. No longer was my body crafted to support all that I wanted to do. Instead, it became a thing to perfect, fix, improve, and refine. Depending on the number on the scale or the size on the tag, it was an object to either be admired or hated. Its shape defined my value and self-worth. Above all else, its form was prized over its function.  For years -- no decades -- while I was busy trying to shrink this or fit into that, much of what my body was actually offering me went unnoticed. I overlooked the fact that it was these two feet that walked the streets of Europe, allowing me to experience cultures beyond my own. It was this body that your dad held as we danced our first dance on our wedding day. And this is the body that gave life to you and your brother. In this body, I biked in the name of charity, hiked mountains, walked coastlines, and sat quietly with you when you needed to feel me close.  When I started running these past few years, I found my body again. It must have happened over time, but one day I realized I no longer had an interest in what my legs looked like. I didn't care if they had cellulite or spider veins, saddlebags or sagging knees. Instead, I marveled at what they could do. The day they carried me through an 18-mile training run and into the deepest part of the trail that I had never reached before, I knew that I would never again regard my body as a mere ornament.  My dear girl, my wish for you is that you live a life in relationship with your body, not divorced from it. See it for what it is; a container to hold the beautiful spirit that lives in you; a vessel to experience all that this life has to offer. Don't waste a single second trying to alter it for the sake of appearance alone. Instead, focus on what it can do, the places it can take you, and the experiences it can unlock.

The 17-year-old actor and rapper is precocious far beyond his years, without a doubt. But he's also pretty far out there. He recently compared himself to Galileo, for example, and committed to disappearing from public life in 10 years in a&nbsp;GQ profile. Will confirmed our suspicions in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on Thursday. He contrasted his current relationship with his 23-year-old son Trey to the never-ending turmoil of raising teenagers.&nbsp; &quot;Teenagers should be an affliction,&quot; Will joked. &quot;Like, 'Hey, Will, how you doin?' 'Man, I got teenagers. Simplex 2, man, simplex 2.' It takes everything you have to raise teenagers.&quot; DeGeneres suggested that the Will and Jada's approach to raising teenagers might not be totally normal, though, saying that the two were unusually supportive of their children. Smith agreed.&nbsp; &quot;Because we're both artists, we decided a long time ago that it's sort of better to flow with what people are naturally more than what our egos need them to be,&quot; the actor explained. &quot;So we really just try to find the things that they're good at and support those things rather than forcing them ...&quot; &quot;Jaden loves math, and Willow is more of a reader,&quot; he continued. &quot;So we kinda just support those things.&quot; The Smith kids are certainly flourishing -- so their parents must be doing something right.

Child-welfare professionals work mightily to practice it. U.S. laws and policies promote its essential truth: Every child deserves to grow up in a safe, permanent, loving family.   Yet tens of thousands of children in our country spend too much of their lives in temporary (i.e., foster) care, unable to return to their original families but without sufficient prospects for moving into new ones.   At the same time, the number of LGBT adults serving as guardians and foster parents -- many of them wanting to adopt -- grows daily. And this reality has raised hopes among children's advocates from coast to coast who see a promising, expanding pool of prospective parents for children who need them.  Even though marriage equality is now the law of the land, however, policies and practices remain in place that impede (and sometimes prevent) members of the LGBT community from becoming parents to these waiting children. On the occasion of National Adoption Awareness Month -- i.e., November -- here are just a few examples:   • Virginia, North Dakota and Michigan have all passed &quot;conscience clause&quot; laws, which allow foster care and adoption providers to exclude LGBT parents based on religious or moral objections. Michigan's was just signed into law this year.   • Arizona and Utah require that preference be given to a &quot;married man and woman&quot; in foster and adoptive placements.  • Utah also imposes a cohabitation ban, which bars individuals who live with unmarried partners (same or different-sex) from adopting.   Some proponents of such restrictions openly acknowledge that they believe gay people are &quot;sinners&quot; or are otherwise problematic simply because of who they are, but most maintain they are motivated primarily by a desire to do what's best for the kids.   It is not homophobia, they insist, to establish policies that promote the benefits of parenting by both a mother and a father who are married to each other. They frequently add that preventing LGBT adults from adopting protects children from being negatively influenced or even physically harmed by the people who are supposed to protect them.   Such arguments are, at best, ill-informed and, in some cases, just plain disingenuous.   If politicians and others who make those assertions truly believe their own words, they should act quickly to remove the millions of supposedly at-risk children who are already in families in which one or both parents are gay. More urgently, they should act expeditiously to end the scourge of single parenthood -- which denies far more kids of two straight, married parents than any other cultural phenomenon in history.   Both suggestions are preposterous, of course, and I'm confident most people eventually will look back at the current restrictions on LGBT parenting and think the same.  The National Center on Adoption and Permanency (NCAP), which I'm honored to lead, is not an LGBT advocacy group. It is a nonprofit organization dedicated not only to helping every child live in an enduring family, but also to promoting evidence-based policies and practices that enable those children and families to succeed. And the evidence in this regard is one-sided and crystal-clear; in a nutshell, it concludes that children grow up healthier in loving homes than in temporary government care, pointedly including when those homes are headed by lesbians or gay men.  That is why a broad range of mainstream organizations - including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Family Physicians, the National Association of Social Workers and the Child Welfare League of America -- have come to the same conclusion as we have at NCAP. These are not groups that would put kids at risk; just the opposite. The common thread is that we work, based on the best available information, for the welfare of children. And we all agree that impeding LGBT adoption does nothing to further that goal.  Not incidentally, most practitioners in the U.S. have come to the same conclusion; that is, a growing majority of adoption agencies nationwide not only accept applications from gay and lesbian prospective parents, but also place children with them. Again, the social workers, therapists and other professionals at these agencies aren't in business to hurt children but, rather, to improve their lives. And they've decided that happens when kids stop shuttling between foster homes and are safely ensconced in permanent ones.   The bottom line is poignantly simple: No state today can prevent LGBT adults from becoming parents, because those adults can do so in other ways (like surrogacy and insemination) or by moving to less-restrictive places. So all a state is doing when it imposes restrictions is shrinking its pool of prospective parents and, as a result, decreasing the odds that children in its custody will ever live in permanent, loving and successful families. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Since first gracing us with his presence 23 years ago this month, Aladdin has been breaking hearts left and right.&nbsp;Yeah, yeah, we know what you're thinking, &quot;Go home, HuffPost, you're drunk. He's a cartoon.&quot; Well ... technically, yes. But Aladdin isn't just any&nbsp;animated hunk. He's the greatest Disney heartthrob of all. Turn up the volume, dim those lights and get ready to rub that magic lamp feel all the feelz.    1. Let's start with the obvious. Aladdin is a fiiiine&nbsp;man. Just look at him. Take it all in.       2. Even though he's an absolute delinquent, his bad boy swag is a MAJOR turn on.  3. He's resourceful af and can pick apples and stuff. This man will feed you.  4. He knows how to show a girl a good time. Just look at Jasmine. She's having the time of her life. THAT COULD BE YOU.  5. Feast your eyes on his glorious smile.&nbsp;Sorry, was that your jaw that just dropped on my foot? Pick that up. WE'RE NOT DONE HERE.  6. He has a pretty sweet whip. Like, have you ever dated a guy with a car that can take you soaring above the clouds?&nbsp;No, you haven't.  7. Oh and his magic carpet is also his wingman, so like, plenty of opportunity for romance there.       8. When he rolls up to Jasmine's balcony it's so romantic it's like,&nbsp;Romeo and Juliet who, lol?!  9. He's not afraid to get wet.  10. He will give you flowers just 'cause, proving that chivalry is&nbsp;so&nbsp;not dead.  11. His idea of a spontaneous date includes flying under the stars, past the pyramids of Egypt, and ending the night with fireworks in China. Like, he will literally show you the world.&nbsp;NO BIG DEAL OR ANYTHING.  12. Not to mention, never has a booty call looked so&nbsp;✦ magical. ☆&nbsp;  13. &quot;If you're a bird, I'm a bird&quot; actually makes sense with him.       14. He's loyal and always tries to do the right thing.&nbsp;Talk about a heart of gold ...       15. You know who's even better than regular ol' Aladdin? Prince Ali Ababwa, that's who. ALL HAIL PRINCE ALI.       16. He can make it rain.       17. His sensual smolder is so perfect it's like he's staring directly into your soul. You can almost hear the angels singing.&nbsp;       18. He's shirtless a lot.&nbsp;HELLOOOO perfectly chiseled pecs sculpted by Zeus himself.       19. Even when he's pissed off, he looks fantastic.&nbsp;       20. Legit fantastic.&nbsp;And then you're all like, Why can't he stare into MY eyes?!  21. This gem of a man who can rock the hell out of a majestic hat.&nbsp;  22. Such a keeper.  GO AWAY JASMINE.&nbsp;  23. If we could rub one out and make three wishes, we'll wish for three of him.       Oh, you know it.       So basically ...       Thirst = quenched. &nbsp; Thanks, Aladdin.&nbsp;    Also on HuffPost:  Still thirsty? You may also like ...

Remember when education was about the three R's: reading, writing and arithmetic? Not so much the case these days, is it?  With technology moving so fast, and an increasingly competitive job market, I wonder whether our school-age kids will be ready to enter the workplace of the future. And, is the educational system properly preparing them? But what skills do they really need to succeed? We've all been hearing for years about the need for increased STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) programs to improve students' skills. Clearly those skills are important and should take precedence over such things as how to read faster. But, is it still true that STEM skills are, or should be, the most important?  Millennials in the workplace today  I recently caught up with a CBS News segment titled, Millennials: New kids on the block asking, &quot;What's the matter with kids today?&quot; If you haven't seen it yet, it's really eye-opening.  Jean Twenge, professor of psychology at San Diego State University, and author of Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans Are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled--and More Miserable Than Ever Before, says that millennials in the workplace are defined by &quot;the combination of not wanting to work hard but still wanting more money and status.&quot;  &quot;This generation's facing a challenging, competitive job market,&quot; Twenge says. &quot;And the problem is, as I see it, they haven't been prepared for things to be so challenging, perhaps because they got so much praise growing up, and they got a trophy just for showing up when they did sports leagues.  &quot;Unfortunately, the workplace doesn't work that way. You have to do a lot more than show up.&quot;  When asked whether millennials are adapting to the workforce, or the workforce is adapting to them, she answered, &quot;That's exactly the question that's going to shape the next ten years.&quot;  Working till 100 years old?  But what about looking past those ten years? A leading British futurist says, that today's kids will have to &quot;work until 100 at 40 different jobs,&quot; reported the Washington Post. Mind-blowing, isn't it? But then again, no one now seems to stay at one company for very long and a freelancer economy seems to be on the rise. So how do we adapt kids for the future workplace, especially one like that?  Rohit Talwar suggests that &quot;schools should teach students more relevant skills, including how to relax, boost their memories and get more sleep, in order to cope.&quot; He adds that, &quot;An 11-year-old child today might live to 120 and work until 100, working at up to 40 jobs spanning ten or more careers.&quot;  He suggested that &quot;new soft skills should be taught in schools then, including meditation to help relaxation and productivity, as well as guidance on managing stress through healthy sleep patterns.&quot;  STEM, and more  Still, the need to be STEM-savvy won't likely be going away 20 years from now, notes David Geary, a developmental psychologist at the University of Missouri, in a Scholastic article.  And other skills will also be essential: &quot;Almost every employer, in every occupation, prefers workers who know how to problem-solve, be creative, work collaboratively, and communicate well,&quot; says Steven Paine, senior advisor of the educational advocacy group Partnership for 21st Century Learning.  Life and career skills  Today's life and work environments require far more than thinking skills and content knowledge, the advocacy group stresses. A globally competitive information age will require: flexibility and adaptability; initiative and self-direction; social and cross-cultural skills; productivity and accountability; and, leadership and responsibility. I believe this is likely to be true in the long-range future as well.  Future-ready kids  The world will no doubt be much changed in 20 or so years. And, perhaps, so will the workplace culture. Perhaps it will be one that we can't even imagine today. (Will there be robots working alongside us? Employees beamed in as holograms at meetings? Virtual reality offices? ) Whatever the future holds, today, it seems more important than ever that we try to help our children, as best we can, to navigate the changes and challenges they'll ultimately have to face in this new world, and help them have a brighter and smarter future -- prepared. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Shortly before she died, Sharma, a mother of two, recorded a farewell video, in which she's in high spirits urging loved ones to &quot;celebrate the life&quot; she lived. She also gave cancer a piece of her mind.&nbsp; &quot;I bring it. You're gonna take over my body?&quot; she says during the video, addressing cancer. &quot;It's just my body -- my mind, my heart, my soul has beat you and it always will. I'm no victim. I'm a powerful person. Gangster for life!&quot;&nbsp; The video, which was played during her funeral, was uploaded to YouTube this past weekend.&nbsp; In May, after finding tumors on her brain, lungs and liver, doctors told Sharma that she had just a few weeks to live, the Ilford Recorder reported. Sharma, who was once the national face of Cancer Research&nbsp;in the U.K., according to the Mirror, maintained a positive attitude throughout her journey, even making music and writing poetry in her final weeks. In addition to urging others to celebrate her life, she mentioned in her message that her spirit would live on through her beloved children and mother. The video also includes a short dance party in the middle.&nbsp; The message wasn't out-of-character for Sharma: Her final Facebook status, posted on Aug. 21, was infused with similar irreverent humor.&nbsp; &quot;This is me saying, 'Peace out people,'&quot; she wrote. &quot;If a bird poos on your head, that's just me saying, 'Yo man.'&quot;&nbsp; H/T Metro UK Also on HuffPost:&nbsp;    (function(){var src_url=&quot;https://spshared.5min.com/Scripts/PlayerSeed.js?playList=519218031&amp;height=&amp;width=100&amp;sid=577&amp;origin=SOLR&amp;videoGroupID=155847&amp;relatedNumOfResults=100&amp;responsive=true&amp;ratio=wide&amp;align=center&amp;relatedMode=2&amp;relatedBottomHeight=60&amp;companionPos=&amp;hasCompanion=false&amp;autoStart=false&amp;colorPallet=%23FFEB00&amp;videoControlDisplayColor=%23191919&amp;shuffle=0&amp;isAP=1&amp;pgType=cmsPlugin&amp;pgTypeId=addToPost-top&amp;onVideoDataLoaded=track5min.DL&amp;onTimeUpdate=track5min.TC&amp;onVideoDataLoaded=HPTrack.Vid.DL&amp;onTimeUpdate=HPTrack.Vid.TC&quot;;if (typeof(commercial_video) == &quot;object&quot;) {src_url += &quot;&amp;siteSection=&quot;+commercial_video.site_and_category;if (commercial_video.package) {src_url += &quot;&amp;sponsorship=&quot;+commercial_video.package;}}var script = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;);script.src = src_url;script.async = true;var placeholder = document.querySelector(&quot;.js-fivemin-script&quot;);placeholder.parentElement.replaceChild(script, placeholder);})(); -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.
