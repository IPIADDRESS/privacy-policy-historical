Of that number, 1.55 million students were suspended multiple times. They were sent home from school for a spectrum of offenses, ranging from minor misbehaviors, like disrupting class,&nbsp;to more serious ones,&nbsp;like possession of drugs.&nbsp; But the implications of these suspensions go far beyond an individual student and their school record. Just one suspension makes a student significantly more likely to drop out of high school, and later, get involved with the criminal justice system or receive public assistance. On a national scale, this results in foregone national income, foregone tax revenues and an increase in crime and needed social services. These economic losses end up costing taxpayers billions of dollars,&nbsp;according to a new analysis from the UCLA Center for Civil Rights Remedies at UCLA’s Civil Rights Project. “Not only will school districts increase graduation rates and generate billions of dollars in economic activity if they stop suspending so many students, the research also shows that reducing the racial discipline gap makes good economic sense and will reduce social costs that hit communities of color the hardest,” Daniel J. Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at UCLA, said in a press release for the report.&nbsp; The report seeks to put an exact dollar amount on how much school suspensions cost taxpayers, and finds that overall, the cost of in-school and out-of-school suspensions for 10th-grade students exceeds $35 billion. This wasn't always the case. Since the 1970s, rates of school suspension have been on the rise, and still tend to disproportionately affect students of color.&nbsp;But this isn't an inevitability. The report highlights school districts, like Los Angeles, that have started to reduce their reliance on suspensions as a discipline tool. Many districts have to begun using restorative justice programs as a means to stymie misbehavior while keeping kids in school.&nbsp; Researchers used several datasets to glean their conclusions, focusing specifically on high schoolers in Florida, California and the nation as a whole. For California and the U.S., researchers used a national longitudinal dataset for the class of 2004 to parse numbers on 10th-grade student suspensions and high school dropout rates. For Florida, researchers used a state-specific dataset to parse the same numbers for ninth-graders. To estimate the causal relationship between suspensions and high school drop outs, researchers controlled for a number of factors, like poor academic performance and socioeconomic status. They found that students are 12 percent more likely to drop out of high school if they have been suspended from school, even after controlling for outside factors.&nbsp; From there, researchers estimated the monetary impact of each dropout, using a previous analysis about the economic value of a high school degree. They looked at this impact using two measures: fiscal and social losses. Fiscal losses are those that relate specifically to lost tax revenue. Social losses &quot;include the aggregate losses incurred by dropouts personally such as their lower income, diminished productivity, and higher expenditures on health care due to poorer health,&quot; says the report. Researchers found that each additional high school dropout amounts to $163,000 in fiscal losses and $364,000 in social losses over a lifetime. When added together, the number of dropouts caused by suspensions -- which totaled 67,000 -- cost the nation $35 billion. This means that if schools decreased their suspension rates, it could have an enormous economic impact.&nbsp; Dr. Russell Rumberger, a co-author of the study and professor at University of California Santa Barbara, told The Huffington Post the study has its limits. For one, the data on suspension rates is somewhat dated. In some places, suspension rates have already started decreasing. Additionally, the study's data is limited to ninth-&nbsp;and 10th-graders. However, Rumberger thinks the study's overall message remains the same, regardless of numbers.&nbsp; &quot;If you take the national figure of $35 billion, maybe it changes to 30 billion or 28. It's still a huge number,&quot; said Rumberger. &quot;The overall message and conclusions would not change.&quot; The report recommends that schools carefully monitor their suspension rates and implement more effective alternatives.&nbsp;Alternatives to suspension take time and money, but the benefits should ultimately outweigh the costs. In Los Angeles for example, the report notes, &quot;the teachers union has complained that many teachers have not been trained in alternative methods like restorative justice or social and emotional learning.&quot; But careful consideration and targeted resources should help change this. &quot;We do have known interventions that can be used instead of suspensions, especially out-of-school suspensions, to mediate it. If you put a kid back in the classroom and nothing changes, then what's going to stop that kid from misbehaving once again,&quot; said Rumberger. &quot;You can do things to keep the kid in the building and address the needs of that child so they will not have another episode.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;______ Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

Deborah Bial, the founder of Posse Foundation, a youth leadership and education access organization that helps students of color attend selective colleges, was the commencement speaker at Pomona on May 15. In preparation for her speech, Bial spoke with 53 kids between the ages of 8 and 10. She also had each child fill out a worksheet with 10 questions.&nbsp;Bial wanted to learn what the young kids were interested in, and what they wanted to tell college graduates. The kids she talked to like video games, meatballs, bubble gum, ice cream and jump rope, Bial reported to the grads. One kid said they wanted to be president so they could tell the world to be &quot;happy and nonviolent.&quot;&nbsp; The children were also very aware of current events, including the candidacy of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.&nbsp; &quot;Of the 53 students who completed the worksheet, more than a third of them wrote that they were afraid of [Trump],&quot; Bial said. &quot;One little boy said 'No one should be sent to another place without their family.'&quot; &quot;To my surprise, their conversation focused heavily on racism and hate,&quot; she went on. &quot;They worry that the next president will keep Muslims out, or will deport their parents. They began a conversation during which they explained that they are worried that all black people could be sent to Africa. One said, 'For me, I am worried that the next president will bring back racism because he's going to send all black people to Africa and then he's gonna kick Mexicans out so only white people can have the whole New York to themselves.' I found this heartbreaking.&quot; &quot;While they are picking up a lot from their parents, they're also dwelling in a place to fear that we formerly reserved for adults,&quot; Bial said. She noted that many of the world's current problems -- from gender inequalities to gun violence and poverty --&nbsp;are ones that Bial's generation failed to fix.&nbsp; &quot;The kids had a lot of pretty good ideas,&quot; Bial said. &quot;They want cool technology. They want the future to be peaceful caring and happy.&nbsp;They want the whole world to have hope and faith. Their ideas were reasonable.&nbsp;One told me, 'I think the president should make sure there's peace around the world and you don't just start kicking people out of where they live in and start sending them somewhere else.' They thought there should be talking instead of violence, including in the Oval Office. They thought the president should just talk to people and reason with them.&quot;&nbsp; Bial left the graduates with a plea on behalf of those elementary school children she'd spoken with.&nbsp; &quot;There are approximately 4.1 million 9-year-olds in the country today,&quot; she said. &quot;We entrust their future to you.&nbsp;In only a little more than a decade, they will be sitting here in your chairs. They will walk in the footsteps you place on this platform.&quot; &quot;It will be their turn,&quot; she went on. &quot;Today,&nbsp;it's yours.

Every day, the Dublin-based dad takes a photo of his 6-year-old daughter Suzie and 3-year-old son Constantin as they go about their regular activities -- from brushing their teeth to coloring together to jumping around the house and playing with toys.  Laskowski is originally from Poland, so the photo series is a great way to give long-distance relatives a glimpse into their day-to-day world. &quot;It's a way to show their grandparents something that they cannot experience -- normal life of the grandkids,&quot; the photographer told The Huffington Post. The beauty and power of everyday moments is the driving theme behind the dad's photos.&nbsp;&quot;Life is what's happening here and now,&quot; he said. &quot;When you take your kids to school and missed the bus, when they leave smudged fingerprints on the window. When they love each other for that split second before they start fighting again -- this is what we should remember. Those are the photographs that will be important in 20 years.&quot;&nbsp;  Laskowski isn't sure his kids totally understand the daily project, but he said they sometimes ask to look at his photos.&nbsp;&quot;We sit and go through them for a few minutes, they coo over themselves as little babies, laugh from the funny ones, and then they go back to whatever they were doing,&quot; he said.&nbsp; As for others who view the photos, the dad wants to convey this message to his fellow parents:&nbsp;&quot;Please take picture of your kids in real-life situations. Take a picture of a messy room, or of a tantrum on the supermarket floor. Print them and hang them in your home.&quot; &quot;It's important to remember that there is beauty in the normal life,&quot; he concluded.

Bowers shared her graduation experience with the online community Breastfeeding Mama Talk and said she began nursing Luna backstage in her cap and gown before the ceremony began.&nbsp; &quot;I didn't feel like I was doing anything out of the norm, but as I was walking around backstage before the ceremony I started to get compliments as well as eye rolls from people who saw me nursing Luna,&quot; she told Breastfeeding Mama Talk. &quot;Right before I was heading to the main floor, a few women were gushing over the sight of me nursing her and snapped a photo of me. I didn't really think anything of it and just enjoyed Luna's snuggles as I watched the ceremony begin.&quot;         Bowers told The Huffington Post she breastfed Luna for the entire ceremony, but because she wasn't allowed to take her onto the floor she walked across the stage alone and then returned to her daughter.

We're raising &quot;digital natives&quot; but we're supposed to be the experts? Actually, no. It turns out, the most effective way to help your kid have a healthy relationship to media is by being their media mentor.  Many of us think we need to have all the answers. Or we just stick our heads in the sand and hope for the best. But, as so often happens, the middle road is juuuuust right. Researcher Alexandra Samuel surveyed 10,000 North American families and found that some parents put strict limits on what their kids could watch or play (&quot;limiters&quot;), especially when they're young, while others (especially parents of teens) let their kids control screen time and embrace the idea that more tech is good tech (&quot;enablers&quot;).  But about a third of the parents -- whom she calls &quot;media mentors&quot; -- consistently engaged in media with their kids, despite their ages, and these kids had better outcomes. Kids of media mentors were less likely to access porn, chat online with a stranger, and impersonate an adult or peer online. Exactly what you're hoping for as a parent, right?  So what does it take to be a &quot;media mentor&quot;? Here are the steps:  Talk about media and tech Here's where most parents are #winning. In the 2015 Common Sense Census: Media Use by Tweens and Teens, 87 percent of tweens reported that their parents regularly discussed Internet safety. These conversations can include everything from stranger danger to creating strong passwords and should be empowering rather than scary.  Play, watch, learn together Media mentors play video games, watch movies, and download apps with their kids. They share their favorite YouTube videos and explore new music together. It's not all the time, of course -- who has time for that? -- but staying engaged and showing interest breeds comfort and camaraderie.  Teach new skills Kids with tech-savvy parents have some advantages when getting up to speed on digital life. They can introduce kids to specialized websites and explain the ins and outs of Instagram. But that doesn't mean the rest of us have nothing to offer. Parents can show kids -- especially young ones -- how to use a mouse, do a Google search, charge a device, and so on. Children's librarians are another tech resource, too.  Follow their interests You know what your kid is into -- whether it's dinosaurs, Minecraft, or Taylor Swift -- and you can use these interests to support positive engagement with media and tech. Find cool dinosaur apps, sign your kid up for a Minecraft coding camp, or take a digital music-making class together.  Do your research High-quality content makes a difference in how kids interact with media. Parents who seek out good content by checking reviews, surveying friends, and exploring content themselves expose kids to better stuff.

A great article was written, which explained why the The Cincinnati Zoo Mother Deserves Empathy.  I agree that the mother deserves empathy.   &quot;Mistakes happen. They are sometimes preventable, sometimes not. Regardless, they are always easy to judge when it's not your mistake that took place. And again, if you have the audacity to say, &quot;I would never let this happen,&quot; I pray you have someone to hold your hand and tell you &quot;mistakes happen&quot; when something terrible and preventable happens on your watch someday. When people on the outside are judging and threatening -- people who have no connection to your or your family. We are all human.&quot;     It is something I wish I never had to say, but I am one of those mothers.  My 9 month old son passed away in January of this year. He is no longer with us today because a mistake happened; my curious sweetheart was left alone for a few moments and he unfortunately suffocated. He was in ICU on life support for twenty days, but he never regained consciousness. His death was awful, and being without him every day is a kind of hell I would not wish on my worst enemy. Every single day is hard when it means living without your baby.  Strangers made comments about me online, just as strangers are making comments on the mother in this story. It is horrible hearing strangers debate your character and fitness to parent, because you are already questioning them yourself as you sit beside your child on life support.  When you just want to hug your child, but can't because he is on too many machines. When all you want is for him to open up his eyes, and he doesn't. When you want to look into his mouth to see his little teeth growing through, but you can't. When you sit next to him dreaming of what kind of life you will create for him if he wakes, but he never does. When all you want for him to do is live the life he was meant to, people you don't know are saying what a terrible mother you are without even knowing any of the facts about the situation.  The mother at the zoo was lucky; my situation could easily have been hers. Children are fast and clever little beings, who can get out of your grasp in a second. Trust me, no matter what harsh things you think you are dishing out, the mother would be delivering even harsher ones to herself on the inside. She doesn't need to hear anything more from strangers, she knows.  And while I disagree with the shooting of the unfortunate gorilla, I ask, what else could possibly have been done?   To the people who say the gorilla should not have been shot, what would you have said had the gorilla killed the child?   Would you have been enraged, saying why did the zoo not act sooner and kill the gorilla?   If I had the smallest chance of bringing back my son, I would do anything. While that is not comfortable to say, when it concerns the taking of a beautiful gorilla's life, I am glad to know that one mother in the world is with her child.  Because I know what it is like to endure a forever without my own. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

So Billy added instead of subtracted his entire homework. At least he still did math, right? There comes a point in the school year when seven and six equals fourteen and you don't care.  3. Clothes Don't Fit, Oh Well! Your children's toes are rubbing against the edges of the sneakers you bought... in August. Who told them to keep growing anyway? Those yoga pants are looking more like capris. But, aren't yoga capris in these days? The next time your child tells you that his shirt is getting too short just tell him to stop raising his hand in class. This way it won't be so short. Problem solved.  4. Bedtime And Wakeup Is Getting Downright Dreadful. You can't even convince yourself that it's bedtime when it's still light outside at 8 p.m. So how are your kids going to buy into it? Let's not even talk about waking up for school. The whining is unreal! Maybe if they just went to bed when you told them,  the mornings wouldn't be so bad. There are days I'd rather watch a Caillou marathon by myself than go through the whole bedtime/wakeup process.  5. You're Running Out of School Snacks. Your fruit snack and Goldfish cracker supply is dangerously low. Instead of replenishing you decide to get creative. Kids can bring cans of cream corn and baked beans for snack, right?  6. You're Sick of Packing Lunches. If you have to make another ham and cheese sandwich, you're going to throw it against the wall. Forget about thinking of different things to pack your child for lunch. Check back in September. At this point packing lunch means making sure they have enough money to buy whatever is being served in the cafeteria. What if they don't like the menu? It's never too early to start teaching those coping skills.  7. You Can't Find the Handle to Your Fridge Because of All the Artwork. The kids are bringing home all of their art projects. Yeah! You're finally getting your Valentine, Easter, and &quot;Holiday&quot; card, all at the same time, in June. What could be better? Now, if you could just get into your fridge.  8. Your Child's Book Bag Has Holes. &quot;Mom, my book bag has a hole in it.&quot; So. There's no way that it's going to get fixed. It's just not happening. Anyway, don't think of them as holes. They're easy access pockets for when junior just needs to find a pencil or eraser right away.  9. You Can't Remember a Saturday Morning That Didn't Involve a Coach or Referee. Sure, sports are great for kids. They have fun. You have fun watching them, but there comes a point when you dread Saturday mornings. The morning fights with the shin guards and cleats are no longer bearable. Trying to clone yourself to make it to all of your kids' games gets exhausting. You want to trade them all in in for an endless cup of coffee and a Lifetime movie, or three.  10. Your Child Is Going on a Field Trip Every Other Day. You remember signing the permission slips, but weren't these all supposed to be spaced out? Your child is going more places in two weeks than you've gone in two months. It's all in the name of &quot;learning&quot;, I know. Let's admit it, the real learning stopped after April vacation.  Before you can say sunscreen and shorts, the kids will back in school and we get to run the hamster wheel all over again! Here's to some time off from glue sticks, flash cards, and school assemblies! -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

I remember the first time I realized that I wasn't comfortable in a bathing suit (age 12).  I have hypothyroidism, a disease which among other things slows your metabolism.  I've struggled with weight gain since puberty, and as a result have a not-so-great relationship with the number on the scale and the size on my jeans label.  I've yo-yo dieted, eliminated carbs, spent hours a day exercising, and while those things have been effective, they just aren't sustainable. I'm a mom, with a full time job, and my priority? It isn't being the smallest pants size I can be. But one of my biggest priorities? To not pass this insecurity on to my own daughter.   I realize that children learn by example, and over the last few months, I realized I was setting a pretty poor one.  I made it my goal to improve my own body image.  After a lot of trial and error, I wanted to share some of the things that helped.  10 Things You Can Do to Stop Hating Your Body  1. List of Physical Attributes: Everyday for 3 weeks, I wrote down one thing I liked about my appearance.  I kept this list in my phone.  Whenever I started that negative internal dialog... I read the list.  2. Exercise for Health, Not Weight Loss:  I want to be clear, I am still focusing on being healthy.  I believe that's important.  But I shifted my focus from weight loss or shrinking my thighs to being the healthiest version of myself.   3. Positive Role Models: You know those friends you body bash with? You spend an hour complaining about how big your thighs are and then saying that your own are worse than theirs.  Yup, I worked on NOT doing that.  I spent more time with my friends who celebrated themselves.  It gave me a positive outlook.  4. Get Rid of Clothes That Don't Fit: Anything that didn't fit? GONE.  What's the point of trying to squeeze into five year old pants from before I had a baby? There isn't one.  5. Flattering Clothes Only: I spent some time figuring out what cuts look best on me.  (Tight shorts? NOT cute.)  And guess what, that's all I even try on.  This has TOTALLY changed my perspective.  Everyone has a body type.  I just work with mine instead of against it.    6. Complimenting Other Women: Positivity breeds positivity.  I found that the more I complimented other women in my life, the more complimentary I was to myself.  7. Taking Pictures: This may sound totally counterintuitive, but taking style pictures for my blog has become a confidence booster.  I'm lucky, I work with some wonderful photographers.  And I've been able to see the contrast between pictures where I look happy and confident vs uncomfortable and shy.  If you're not a blogger, I suggest setting up a photo session.  Just you, you and you kids, a couple's shoot -- having those beautiful pictures to look at? Makes a difference.  8. Finding Celebrities That Look Like Me: We all look at a magazines, movies, and television.  Instead of lusting after skinny thighs and bikinis, I spent some time finding &quot;beautiful people&quot; that looked like me.  In fact, I created an entire secret Pinterest board of them.  9. Morning Compliments with My Daughter: Each morning before the day begins, my daughter and I sit together and give each other compliments.  &quot;You look beautiful.&quot; &quot;I am proud of you.&quot;  The best? The weekend mornings when I sleep in, and I wake up to her and my husband staring at me (drool and all) -- her first comment? Always, &quot;You look beautiful mama!&quot;  10. Find Accessories That Put a Little Pep in My Step: Shoes? They have nothing to do with body type. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

She's the kid who shares at playdates, politely uses &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; without much reminder from me, and runs over to the little boy who's crying on the jungle gym to ask what's wrong. She's a gem and a true charmer, that one! That's why I was taken off guard when the sabotage first began. Strange things started happening around me, to me, that could have passed as simple coincidences at first glance. But, over time and repetition, I had a sneaking suspicion that a busy little toddler was behind the shenanigans -- I was on to her games!  Here are 8 ways my toddler has sabotaged me and yours may be sabotaging you too:   1. Missing Wallet:  When you realize your wallet is missing from your purse at crucial moments -- like after unloading 792 items onto the conveyor belt at the grocery store, or ordering your very particular and much-anticipated Venti coffee, or pulling into the gas station after driving around on empty for two days straight. CRUCIAL. MOMENTS. And then that moment of disbelief when you later find said wallet under your toddler's pillow.   2. Strategically Placed Legos:  When you get a 5:45 AM wake-up call from your toddler after pulling an all-nighter with her baby brother and go to take that groggy first step out of bed, only to land in a pile of Legos placed ever-so-cleverly at the exact position your feet hit the floor.   3. Rogue Stickers:  When you get home from running a bunch of errands - the usual post office, Target, grocery store routine -- only to catch a glimpse of yourself in the full-length mirror with a giant Mickey Mouse sticker in the middle of your rear end, and you realize you are the Mystery Mousekatool!    4. Suspicious Toothbrush:  When you find your toothbrush lying on the ground next to the toilet and self-doubting thoughts flood your mind -- like, did I accidentally put it there in my sleep-deprived state this morning? Or perhaps I knocked it off the sink while getting out of the shower. But then you scan the room and lock eyes with your toddler who's wearing a mischievous grin and babbling something about &quot;cleaning the house&quot; today. Could she have -- would she have -- &quot;cleaned&quot; the toilet with your toothbrush?! (Yes).  5. Cheeks (not) on Fleek:  When you're rushing to get out the door for your long-awaited date night with your partner (and the first time you've put on makeup in over a month) and you go to apply a little blush when you realize your blush brush has previously been &quot;dipped&quot; into your darkest eye shadow, now leaving dark blue streaks across your cheek bones. #cheeksnotonfleek    6. Stashed Shoes: When you go to put on your tennis shoe and something just doesn't feel right, so you take it off and turn it upside down to empty out the newly discovered contents which consist of eight tiny pebbles from the garden, a blue and yellow coloring crayons, and 7 goldfish crackers.   7. Chap Stick Fun:  When you find yourself buying a new tube of chap stick on the regular because every other time you go to apply some to your lips, you notice the chap stick itself has been scooped out of the tube from a tiny, curious finger.  8. Perfectly Timed Poops:  When you're sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the freeway, or nursing the baby who's finally latched on, or just lathered up your hair and body with soap in the shower, or just got into the pool for mommy-and-me swim lessons -- and your toddler screams, &quot;I have to go poo-poo RIGHT NOW!&quot; And then the frantic dash for the toilet begins while you curse your decision to potty train early.
