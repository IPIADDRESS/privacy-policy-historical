<h1>ECFMG<sup><small>®</small></sup> Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>The Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates ("ECFMG") shares your concerns for maintaining the integrity and privacy of personal information collected on the Internet. ECFMG is committed to protecting your privacy, and the following Privacy Policy ("Policy") is intended to explain our information collection and dissemination practices in connection with the <a href="../index.html">www.ecfmg.org</a> web site (the "Site"). Please review the entire Policy and feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@ecfmg.org">webmaster@ecfmg.org</a> if you have any questions. For privacy practices specific to the Step 2 Clinical Skills Calendar and Scheduling Web Site, please see this site's <a href="2csusagr.html">User Agreement</a>. </p>

<p>1) <b>Collection of Personal Information from Site Users</b> </p>

<p>While visiting our Site, you may choose to provide personal information to us in the process of completing various on-line forms for ECFMG's program of certification and other programs and services for international medical students and graduates. This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, date of birth, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, credit card information, social security or national identification number, citizenship, family status, and information related to your medical education, training, and licensure. You may also choose to provide personal information to us in the process of filling out an on-line application for employment with ECFMG.  This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, employment history, and list of references.  By providing your personal information on-line, you consent to allow ECFMG to use that information in accordance with this Policy.  In general, applicants for ECFMG certification and applicants for employment with ECFMG are required to respond to all of the questions on our application forms. During the course of applying for ECFMG certification, applicants may be asked about their ethnicity.  Applicants for certification, however, are not required to provide information regarding ethnicity.  Providing information regarding your ethnicity is optional and choosing a particular answer or choosing not to provide this information will not affect the outcome of your application for ECFMG certification. ECFMG uses information about the ethnicity of its applicants for research purposes, and it is kept confidential.  Except in cases where ECFMG is recruiting standardized patients to participate in clinical skills exams, ECFMG does not require candidates for employment to provide information regarding ethnicity.  If, for any reason, you choose not to provide your personal information on-line, you may download certain of our <a href="../pubshome.html">available forms</a> from the Site and mail them to us.  Applications for employment with ECFMG, participation in ECFMG’s IMG Advisors Network (IAN), and the ERAS® Return of Document Service (RODS) may not be downloaded from the Site or requested via phone, fax or mail. Such applications must be completed on-line through the Site. </p> 

<p>To request a single copy of any available publication or form, contact ECFMG by telephone at (215) 386-5900, by fax at (215) 386-9196, or in writing at the address listed below in "Inquiries and Concerns."</p> 

<p>When a User accesses any of the online services at the Site, cookies are placed on the User's web browser. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your computer and allows identification of the User. The cookies placed are used solely to identify the same user from web page to web page and to indicate, in the case of Users with a user id, that the User has been properly authenticated. All cookies are removed when a User leaves the Site and the browser is closed. With the exception of the login, payment, on-line employment application, OASIS, IWA, IMED, IMED Subscription Service, Step 2 CS Calendar and Scheduling, CVS ON-LINE, and IAN  pages, all non-service web pages are hosted by Verio. For more information regarding Verio's information collection practices, please see Verio's privacy policy at <a href="http://www.verio.com/about/legal/privacy/">www.verio.com/about/legal/privacy/</a>.</p> 

<p>2) <b>Security</b></p> 

<p>As part of ECFMG's pledge to protect your privacy, we employ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology and password protection to portions of the Site to prevent unauthorized access to your personal information. In order to access your personal information, you must first confirm your identity by entering your user id and a password. All authentication pages are secured by SSL technology. Similarly, as you prepare to pay for your programs and services, you will enter our secure payment web page and will have a limited amount of time to enter the required information. Please note that pages other than the authentication pages, payment page, on-line employment application, OASIS, IWA, IMED Subscription Service, CVS ON-LINE, and IAN are not secured by SSL or other encryption programs. ECFMG uses third-party vendors, such as VeriSign and TeleCheck, in order to process your on-line payments. Please see VeriSign's Privacy Policy at <a href="http://www.verisign.com/truste/index.html">www.verisign.com/truste/index.html</a> and TeleCheck's Privacy Policy at <a href="http://www.telecheck.com/home/privacy_policy.html">www.telecheck.com/home/privacy_policy.html</a> for more information regarding their security and privacy practices.</p> 

<p>ECFMG utilizes a third-party application called HireTouch owned by ImageTrend Inc. to process its on-line employment applications. Please see ImageTrend Inc.’s Privacy Policy at <a href="https://www.hiretouch.com/privacypolicy">https://www.hiretouch.com/privacypolicy</a> for more information regarding its security and privacy practices.</p>

<p>Please note that, while ECFMG has endeavored to create a secure and reliable site for Users, the confidentiality of any communication transmitted to or from ECFMG via the Site or e-mail cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, ECFMG is not responsible for the security of information transmitted via the Internet.</p> 

<p>3) <b>Use of Personal Information Collected</b> </p>

<p>ECFMG uses the personal information you provide in order to process your applications and requests for or participation in services and in order to verify that you meet the minimum qualifications for our programs and services or for employment with ECFMG. Additionally, ECFMG may use aggregated personal information for research and statistical purposes. ECFMG does not use your personal information for marketing or promotional purposes. In connection with on-line employment applications, except where you tell ECFMG not to, we will keep the information that you submit for future consideration.</p>  

<p>4) <b>Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties</b> </p>

<p>The United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) is sponsored jointly by the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) and the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB). The NBME exercises review authority over ECFMG's application materials for this multi-step examination. As a result, if you apply for examination, the NBME will have access to your personal information in this capacity. In order to ensure an efficient and accurate examination process for applicants, portions of the personal information you provide to us is retained in a database shared by ECFMG, NBME, and FSMB for the purposes of exam registration and scheduling. Additionally, this information, as well as performance data from the examination, is used by these organizations for research and statistical purposes, although only in the aggregate.</p> 

<p>You should also note that by signing and submitting the Certification Statement or Certification of Identification Form associated with the USMLE application, you authorize ECFMG to transmit the information contained in your application, or that otherwise may become available to ECFMG, to "any federal, state or local governmental department or agency, to any hospital or to any other organization or individual who, in the judgment of ECFMG, has a legitimate interest in such information." </p>

<p>By participating in ECFMG’s IMG Advisors Network (IAN) as an advisor, you acknowledge that information about yourself that you submit to the IAN database, such as your family status, training institution, and training specialty, and other information from your ECFMG record, such as your name, gender, and medical school, will be available to eligible users of the IAN database. Advisees who select an advisor from the IAN database acknowledge that personal information from their ECFMG record and application for ECFMG J-1 visa sponsorship, including their name, medical school, graduation year, and training specialty and institution, as well as the e-mail address they submit to the IAN database will be sent by e-mail to each advisor they select, unless they choose not to include such information in the e-mail message to the selected advisor.</p>

<p>By requesting return of your ERAS documents via courier shipping through RODS, you acknowledge that ECFMG and FedEx® will exchange information that you submit with your RODS request (such as your mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address) and information from your ECFMG record (such as your name) that is necessary to process your request.</p>

<p>Except for User information collected in connection with on-line employment applications, ECFMG also shares certain User information (e.g., name, ECFMG applicant number and certification status, medical school and/or date of birth) with the American Medical Association (the "AMA") and the Association of American Medical Colleges (the "AAMC"). These organizations use the data that we provide to update and maintain their medical provider databases.</p> 

<p>Other than the instances described for the IAN database, RODS requests, the AMA, and the AAMC, or as ECFMG shall notify User of in the future, ECFMG pledges not to sell, rent, offer, or otherwise disclose any personal information, such as names, e-mail addresses, postal addresses, telephone numbers, credit card information, employment history and other personal information that User voluntarily provides to ECFMG, to any organization or individual without such a legitimate interest (collectively "Third Parties"), except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws or valid legal processes, or to protect the rights or property of ECFMG. </p>

<p>As noted above, ECFMG uses third-party vendors to process your on-line payment transactions. In order to process these transactions, your payment information must be disclosed to these third parties. You may review VeriSign's Privacy Policy by clicking <a href="http://www.verisign.com/truste/index.html">here</a> and you may review Telecheck's Privacy Policy by clicking <a href="http://www.telecheck.com/home/privacy_policy.html">here</a>. By paying for your programs and/or services by on-line check, you authorize TeleCheck to obtain a report of your check-writing history in order to prevent fraud and for other authentication purposes. </p>

<p>5) <b>Access and Ability to Correct Personal Data</b> </p>

<p>Using ECFMG's On-line Applicant Status and Information System (<a href="https://oasis2.ecfmg.org">OASIS</a>), properly identified applicants may access and verify or change such personal information as name of record, postal address, e-mail address, fax number and status of their financial account. You may also check the status of your USMLE applications and score reports, USMLE scheduling permits, and medical education credentials.
