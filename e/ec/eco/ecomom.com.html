        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</span></p>


	<p>Our
primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide our
visitors with a superior customized online experience. Among other
things, we use customer contact information to fill orders, contact
prior purchasers to inform them of their order status, to remind
customers of events through our reminder service(s), to send our
customers’ friends or loved ones greetings, emails or hints to send our
products through a greeting, email a friend or hint service, and to
send service and promotional emails.</p>


	<p>We may perform
statistical analysis of aggregate customer behavior. This allows us to
measure relative customer interest in the various areas of each of our
Sites for product development purposes and to improve the design of our
Sites. Any information we collect is used for our own internal purposes
to improve the content and navigation of our Sites, to enhance users’
experiences when visiting our Sites, to customize the content and/or
layout of our pages, and to provide the services required by an
individual user. We may also use information to notify consumers about
updates to our Sites, to complete user initiated transactions, to trace
false orders and to contact consumers directly, or through our
third-party service partners, for marketing purposes. In addition, we
may seek to update you or your recipients’ personal information in our
records through third party services that provide updated names,
emails, addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and other information. We
may then use this acquired information to enhance our services or
marketing efforts to you or your recipients.</p>


	<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">We gather information in the following ways:</span></p>


	<p>Shopping:
We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to
gather broad demographic information, and to monitor the level of
activity on our Sites. We collect information from visitors to each of
our Sites regarding the referring <span class="caps">URL</span>, your
IP address, which browser you used to come to any one of our Sites, the
country, state and telephone area code where your server is located,
and the pages of any one of our Sites that you viewed during your visit.</p>


	<p>Ordering:
When you order from us, we collect Personally Identifiable Information
from you. If you order one of our products or services, we will collect
and maintain your name, email address, mailing address, telephone or
mobile number, product selections, credit card number (or check or
money order information if using such payment methods while ordering
via mail), order number, referring <span class="caps">URL</span>, IP
address and a password, as well as the recipient’s name, address,
telephone or mobile number and email address. We collect this, and
other information, as disclosed in this Policy, in order to fill your
order, to communicate with you about your order, or the recipient, as
appropriate, and to send you promotional materials. Before confirming
your order, you will have the opportunity to review the product order
form and make changes and additions to the information it contains and
these changes will be automatically kept for future use. If you cancel
an order or do not complete an order we may collect and use any email
address or other information that you have entered as we would collect
and use it if you had completed an order.</p>


	<p>When an order is
placed for delivery to you by a third party we need to collect
Personally Identifiable Information regarding the third party to
fulfill the order. This information includes their name, address,
telephone or mobile number and email address.</p>


	<p>Track/Modify
Order: If you use our track &amp; modify your order features/service we
will gather your email address and account password, if you have one,
in order to locate your order so that we may give our most recent
tracking information, or so that you may modify the order. If you
choose to modify your order, we may collect information that we would
normally collect when you order products, as explained in the above
paragraph.</p>


	<p>Notices to Recipients: If you are a recipient
of an order placed by a third party we may send one or more emails
regarding the order, including those regarding customer service issues.
In addition, we may send you additional emails in compliance with
applicable laws in order to promote our Sites and services and to seek
your consent to opt in to receive our various newsletters, promotional
emails and other services. If we send you emails notifying you of an
order, or that promote our Sites and services, they will contain an opt
out link or email address. We may also telephone you regarding the
shipment of your order. You can also opt out of receiving newsletters,
promotions, non-transactional related emails or phone calls from us
hereunder by sending an email to us at info@ecomom.com</p>


	<p>Corporate

us to inquire about corporate programs (either via email, telephone,
letter or our online web forms), we collect, for example, your name,
company name, email and telephone or mobile number. We may add you to a
list for future newsletters and promotions regarding corporate sales.
Upon signing up for a corporate account we will contact you by either
email or telephone to determine how we can best serve your corporate
needs. We will also give you the opportunity to receive periodic
updates regarding our corporate services. If you make purchases through
your corporate account we shall gather similar information that we
gather when you order as an individual, plus certain information
regarding your corporation. You can opt out of receiving newsletters,
promotions, non-transactional related emails or phone calls from us by
sending an email to us at info@ecomom.com.</p>


	<p>Surveys

of our customers or product recipients to voluntarily complete surveys
online or via telephone, which may be collected by an independent third
party. Individual survey answers are confidential, although Non
Personally Identifiable Information may be collected and disclosed to
third parties. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, simply
decline to participate when asked.</p>


	<p>Contests and
Sweepstakes: We may from time to time conduct contests, sweepstakes or
other promotions. Customers who choose to participate may be asked to
provide Personally Identifiable Information. That information may then
be used by us for such purposes as notifying winners and fulfilling
promotional obligations as well as providing electronic newsletters and
promotional emails for our products and/or services (which you can opt
out of receiving as described more fully below).</p>


	<p>Newsletters
&amp; Promotional Emails: We may offer free electronic newsletters and
promotional emails for products and/or services offered on any one or
more of our Sites as a service to our prior customers from any of our
Sites. We may send you newsletters and emails periodically listing
current specials and deals from us or through our third-party service
partners. However, you will have the choice to opt out of receiving
newsletters and promotional emails for products and/or services offered
on any one or more of our Sites. Once we have processed your request,
we will not send you promotional emails with respect to products and/or
services offered by us through the particular Site(s) of which you had
opted out unless you opt back in to receiving such communications
directly or by making an additional purchase or attempted purchase on
one of our Sites. There may be opportunities to subscribe to an email
list that will send you information about the events on our Sites, but
we will only add you to the list with your consent. To stop receiving
our newsletters that pertain to any one or more of our Sites, send an
email to us at info@ecomom.com with the subject message:
unsubscribe re: newsletter_name.</p>


	<p>Cookies/Clear GIFs: In
conjunction with our third-party service partners, we make limited use
of cookies and clear GIFs to gather information when you visit any one
of our Sites, make a purchase and when you click through to any one of
our Sites from a targeted email, newsletter or partner site. We may
also use cookies and clear GIFs to gather and compile such information
about you when you return to our Sites so that we may better customize
our services to you.</p>


	<p>Cookies are small files that a site
or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through
your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service
provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember
certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember
and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help
us understand your preferences based on previous or current site
activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We
also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic
and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and
tools in the future.</p>


	<p>We may contract with third-party
service providers to assist us in better understanding our site
visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the
information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and
improve our business.</p>


	<p>You can choose to have your computer
warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn
off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Mozilla Firefox
or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so
look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your
cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won’t have access to many
features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our
services will not function properly.</p>


	<p>Contact Information
and Third-Party Data: If you contact us by telephone, email or letter,
we may keep a record of your contact information, correspondence or

collect such information in a file specific to you. If you provide us
feedback through any one of our Sites, by email or by calling one of
our customer service representatives, we may ask for your name and
email address in order to send you a reply. If other users or third
parties send us correspondence about your activities or purchases on
any one of our Sites, or if you are the recipient of products sent by
another customer, we may keep the information in a file specific to
you. If you are using a greeting, hint or reminder service on one of
our Sites, we may ask you to provide the name, mailing address, email
address, telephone number, mobile phone number, age, date of birth,
anniversary date or other personal annuity date of you, a friend, a
loved one, family members or other third parties, and certain holiday

send them or you a hint or reminder about an event that could be made
more special with the gift of our products. We store this information
for the purpose of sending one or more emails in connection with such
an event. You, the loved one, friend, family member, or other third
party, may contact us at to request the removal of this information
from our database.</p>

more special with the gift of our products. Misuse of our greeting or
email a friend service by providing false email addresses or posing as
someone else when sending a greeting or email may result in legal
action and the disclosure of information about you, including your
computer’s IP address, as part of any investigation into your actions.</p>


	<p>Affiliate
and Partnership Programs: Where applicable, you may purchase products
from us through a link on one of our affiliates’ (Affiliates) websites.
We pay each Affiliate a commission, or a portion of the sales made to
those who link to our Site(s) from the Affiliate’s site. Some of our
Affiliates may run a rewards or charity program (the Programs). Under
these Programs, participants receive credits based on the commissions
an Affiliate receives from sites such as ours. Participants in such
programs can donate their credits to a chosen charitable organization,
or keep them for their own use and benefit. If you come to our Sites
through an Affiliate’s site, make a purchase from us, and you are a
participant in such Programs, we may share your name, e-mail address
and the value of your purchases, including that data necessary for
Affiliates to credit participants with purchases made under their
Program, with a third-party service partner(s)which may collect data
for our standard Affiliate program. In addition, we may also share such
information with other third-party Affiliates if you have registered
with their affiliate, affinity or rewards Programs, and that Affiliate
has made sales for you, processed your order and/or if such third-party
Affiliate directed you to one of our Sites.</p>

	<p>We
implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your

secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons
who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to
keep the information confidential. When you place orders or access your

	<p>We
do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your

notice, except as described below. The term “outside parties” does not
include store.ecomom.com. It also does not include website hosting
partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website,
conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties
agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your

law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights,
property, or safety.</p>


	<p>However, non-personally identifiable
visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing,
advertising, or other uses.</p>
