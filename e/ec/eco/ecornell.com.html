        <p class="banner">eCornell is committed to protecting your privacy. The following Privacy Policy describes what information we collect from you when you visit this site, and how we use this information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our privacy practices.</p>
      <p><b>The Information eCornell Collects<br>
      </b>eCornell collects two kinds of information on this site: (1) registration information that is voluntarily supplied by visitors to this site who enroll in the programs offered through eCornell and (2) tracking information that is automatically collected as visitors navigate through this site. </p>
      <p>If you choose to register for enrollment in one or more programs offered through eCornell, you will be required to provide certain enrollment information that we need to process your application for enrollment. This site automatically recognizes and records certain non-personal information, including the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com or cornell.edu); the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and the operating system; the date and time you access this site; and the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to this site. We may also collect tracking information through the use of cookies, which place certain identifying information on your computer to facilitate your future access.</p>
      <p> This site also includes links to other websites hosted by third parties. When you access any such website from this site, use of any information you provide will be governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. For example, many of our pages contain chat functionality provided by a third-party vendor, LivePerson, Inc. For more information on how LivePerson uses text entered in the LivePerson chat window, see their <a href="http://www.liveperson.com/help/privacy.asp" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>.  </p>
      <p><b>How eCornell Uses This Information</b><br>
        We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We share your registration information with Cornell University, which will use it as a part of your enrollment in programs offered through eCornell. In addition, we may provide aggregated statistical data to reputable third-party vendors, but this data will include no personally identifying information. We may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of eCornell, Cornell University, our users, or others. We may also release information to your employer, if your enrollment is through a corporate agreement and disclosure is needed to comply with the employer's request for information, and to any third party administrator, if your enrollment is through this third party administrator and disclosure is needed to comply with the third party administrator's request for information.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>How eCornell Protects Your Information<br>
        </b>When you log in or use your credit card with us, we use a secure
        server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you
        input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the data we collect
        is protected against unauthorized access. As effective as encryption
        technology is, however, no security system is completely impenetrable,
        so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of our database, nor can
        we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being
        transmitted to us over the lnternet.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Your Rights Under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</b><br>
  If you enroll in a program offered through eCornell, personally identifiable information you provide us, other than basic directory information, or that we or Cornell University create that pertains to you, may be protected from disclosure under the provisions of the federal Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). You may also have specific rights with regard to accessing this information and correcting any errors. For further information respecting the applicability of FERPA and your rights under it, please contact us at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@ecornell.com">helpdesk@ecornell.com</a>.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Your Consent</b><br>
  By using this website, you consent to the collection and use of this information
    by eCornell and by Cornell University for the purpose of your enrollment
    in programs offered through eCornell. If we decide to change our privacy
    policy, we will post those changes on this page before the changes take effect.
    Of course, our use of information gathered while the current policy is in
    effect will always be consistent with the current policy, even if we change
    that policy later. If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please
    contact us at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@ecornell.com">helpdesk@ecornell.com</a>. </p>
