<h3>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h3>
A web cookie, a commonly used data collection technology, is simply a
piece of text which can be placed on the browser of your personal
computer or mobile device and subsequently read as you visit a web
site.&nbsp; A cookie may be a session cookie, that is, a cookie
that remains on your browser while you are logged on to a particular
web site and then disappears when you close your browser, or it may be
a persistent cookie, a cookie that remains on your browser over a
period of time.&nbsp; Information from a cookie may be collected
and used in aggregate form.&nbsp; Or data may be collected into an
individual profile or record.&nbsp; That individual record may
either be unique but anonymous, or the profile can be linked with
information that identifies you as an individual.&nbsp; <br>
You can learn more about cookies, generally, at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a><br>
<h3>HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?</h3>
We may use cookies for a number of purposes:<br><ol><li>
We may use a limited number of cookies
essential to particular services you have requested or for security
purposes. A few of our sites use a cookie for a shopping cart
function when you purchase services or offerings. In particular, if you
have registered for a site or use a customer portal we may use a cookie
to authenticate the pc or mobile device that you are using.</li><li>
We allow third parties to set
analytics, or performance, cookies to collect and report aggregate
information. These cookies provide reporting to us on an aggregate
basis and so, do not identify you at all. We use the aggregate reports
to understand how our web sites are used and improve their usefulness
to our audiences.</li><li>
A number of cookies also support how
our web sites function, identifying your pc or end device on a unique
but anonymous basis. These cookies may, for example, remember
your language preferences or recognize an individual’s activity within
a single session.</li><li>
If you register for a site, we use a
cookie to associate your presence with a specific user name and
password or account.&nbsp;We may use a persistent cookie to
recognize you automatically each time you return, but only if you ask
us to do so. We may also use cookies to prepopulate your
login or forms you fill out on the site with information you have
already provided. Finally, we may use certain demographic
information to enable third party ad servers (see below) to show you
ads based on information about you in your business capacity, for
example, your title within a company or the size of that company.</li><li>
Some of sites may also allow third
party ad servers to serve their own cookies to display advertising on
our web sites. We do not determine, control or have access to their
cookies.&nbsp; In addition, some of the ads they serve may generate
their own cookies.&nbsp; We will list all cookies shortly so that
you can review their privacy policies for more detail about their
practices.</li></ol>
