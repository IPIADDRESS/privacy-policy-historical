									<h4><a id="FraudPreventionAgencies" class="mce-item-anchor" name="FraudPreventionAgencies"></a><span class="subheader2">9. Fraud prevention agencies</span></h4>
									<br>
									<p>9.1 When You (or the Business Entity You represent) are applying for ecoPayz Services and open an ecoAccount with Us, We are performing Our identity and security validation and verification checks. We may use fraud prevention agencies to help Us with this. We may also cooperate with and disclose Your personal information to fraud prevention agencies on a periodic basis while providing ecoPayz Services to You (or to the Business Entity You represent) to help detect financial crime, fraud and money-laundering risks. This may include recording sensitive personal information such as criminal offences You have been accused of.</p>
									<p>9.2 We use fraud prevention agencies to help Us to obey applicable laws or for Our legitimate interests. Information received from fraud prevention agencies are used by Us to:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Carry out Our identity and security validation and verification checks.</li>
										<li>Help identify, monitor and prevent financial crime, fraud and money-laundering.</li>
										<li>Exercise Our rights and obligations set out in the Terms of Use and other contracts concluded between Us and You (or the Business Entity You represent).</li>
									</ul>
									<p>9.3 Fraud prevention agencies may keep Your personal information for different lengths of time, if they found risk of financial crime, fraud or money-laundering.</p>
									<p>9.4 Fraud prevention agencies may disclose and allow access to government authorities and regulators, for example, law enforcement bodies, to Your personal information worldwide. This is to support their duty to detect, investigate, prevent and prosecute financial crime, fraud and money-laundering.</p>

									<h4><a id="AutomatedDecisionMaking" class="mce-item-anchor" name="AutomatedDecisionMaking"></a><span class="subheader2">10. Automated decision making</span></h4>
									<br>
									<p>10.1 We sometimes use systems to make automated decisions based on personal information We have or We are allowed to collect from others about You. This helps Us to make sure Our decisions are quick, fair, efficient and correct based on what We know. These automated decisions can affect Our provision of ecoPayz Services and other services similar to or connected with ecoPayz Services to You (or to the Business Entity You represent) now and in future, or fees We charge from You (or from the Business Entity You represent).</p>
									<p>10.2 We are making the following automated decisions:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Opening an ecoAccount.</strong> When You (or the Business Entity You represent) are applying for ecoPayz Services and open an ecoAccount with Us, We are performing Our identity and security validation and verification checks based on what We know and based on the personal information You (or the Business Entity You represent) provide to Us. This may include checking of age, residence, nationality, financial position. We are doing this to make sure You (or the Business Entity You represent) have told Us true and correct information, to confirm Your identity and to detect and prevent financial crime, fraud and money-laundering risks.</li>
										<li><strong>Detecting fraud.</strong> We use Your personal information to detect if Your (or the Business Entity’s You represent) ecoAccount is perhaps used for financial crime, fraud or money-laundering or being used or is used in the manner that potentially abuses ecoPayz Services or violates the Terms of Use. We may detect that an ecoAccount is used in a way that is unusual for Your (or to the Business Entity You represent). We may at Our discretion suspend or otherwise restrict the functionality of Your (or the Business Entity’s Your represent) ecoAccount at any time, if We suspect unauthorised or fraudulent use of Your (or the Business Entity’s You represent) ecoAccount or that it has been accessed without Your (or the Business Entity’s You represent) authorization.</li>
										<li><strong>Fees.</strong> We may decide what fees should be determined for some services on the basis of what We know.</li>
										<li><strong>Tailoring ecoPayz Services and other services similar to or connected with ecoPayz Services.</strong> We may place You (or the Business Entity You represent) in groups with similar customers. These are called customer segments. We use these to study and learn about Our customers’ needs and to make decisions based on what We learn. This helps Us to design ecoPayz Services and other services similar to or connected with ecoPayz Services for different customer segments, and to manage Our relationships with them.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>10.3 As an individual You have rights over automated decisions. You have the right:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>To ask Us not to make our decisions based on the automated means alone.</li>
										<li>To object an automated decision and ask that an individual reviews it.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>10.4 <a target="_blank" href="https://secure.ecopayz.com/contact.aspx"><span>Please contact Us</span></a><span>, to exercise Your rights mentioned in the preceding paragraph.</span></p>

									<h4><a id="Transfer" class="mce-item-anchor" name="Transfer"></a><span class="subheader2">11. Transfer of personal information to other countries</span></h4>

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your personal information is treated securely and is processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If We transfer Your personal information outside the EEA, We will make sure that one of the following safeguards is put in place:</p>
									<ul>

										<li>A contract with the recipient according to which the recipient is obliged to protect personal information to the same standards as required in the EEA.</li>

									<p>12.3 We study Your personal information to gain a view on what may interest You (or the Business Entity You represent), or what You (or the Business Entity You represent) may want or need. This is how We decide which special features, promotions, products or services may be relevant for You (or for the Business Entity You represent).</p>
									<p>12.4 We can only use Your personal information for marketing purposes, if We have either Your consent or a ‘legitimate interest’. This is when We have a business or commercial reason to use Your personal information and non-personal information. However, when We process Your personal information for Our legitimate interest, it must not unfairly go against what is right for You or is in Your interests.</p>
									<p>12.5 <strong>For marketing purposes, We will contact You by post, e-mail, telephone, text message and/or recorded calls depending on Your choice, unless You have asked Us not to.</strong> You can either:</p>

										<li>Ask Us to stop contacting You for marketing purposes by post, e-mail, telephone, text message and/or recorded calls depending on Your choice by <a target="_blank" href="https://secure.ecopayz.com/contact.aspx"><span>contacting Us</span></a> at any time.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>12.6 If You change Your mind You can update Your choices at any time by contacting Us.</p>
									<p>12.7 We may ask You to confirm or update Your choices, if You apply for a use or use any new product or service with Us in future. We will also ask You to do this, if there are changes in applicable laws or the structure of Our business.</p>
									<p>12.8 Even if You asked Us not to contact You for marketing purposes, You (or the Business Entity You represent) will still receive statements and other important information regarding ecoPayz Services, such as changes to ecoPayz Services and information on Transactions or eMoney Transfers.</p>

									<br>
									<p>13.1 We will retain Your personal information as long as You (or the Business Entity You represent) are Our customer and for at the least for the period necessary for Us to comply with Our legal obligations and for Our business purposes.</p>
									<p>13.2 Closing Your (or the Business Entity’s You represent) ecoAccount does not mean that We delete personal information that We hold on You. We will continue to keep Your personal information for at least 5 (five) years or longer for one of these reasons:</p>
