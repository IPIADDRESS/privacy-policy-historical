<b>How We Use Your Contact Information</b><br><br>

Intertec Publishing must collect certain information from you in order to serve you as a customer.  This may include your name, job title, company, physical mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers, plus survey information on your business and job responsibilities.  We may require this information to determine if you qualify for a free subscription to one of our magazines or to receive information on our web sites.<br><br>

We use the contact information you provide us-including your phone, fax, and e-mail addresses-primarily to deliver the service you have requested.  We will also use this information to contact you when it is time to renew a subscription or update your order, and to inform you of other Intertec products and services that may be of interest to you.<br><br>

We do rent certain lists on a one-time use basis to carefully screened companies offering products and services directly related to the industries we cover. These lists may include your name, physical mailing address, and/or telephone number, and are selected on the basis of the information you have provided about your business and job.  As explained below, we honor requests from customers who do not want to be included in list exchanges.<br><br>

We do <b>not</b> release e-mail addresses or fax numbers to any third party, but we will send e-mail or fax messages to our customers on behalf of selected advertisers.  We screen messages carefully to be sure they are directly related to your business interests. All e-mail or fax messages are clearly identified as coming from the I-Lists Service of Intertec Publishing, and include instructions on how to remove your name from future messaging.<br><br>


<b>Sensitive Personal Information
and Information on Children</b><br><br>

Certain sensitive personal information you may provide to us is <b>never</b> shared with other parties. Sensitive information includes a Social Security number, mother's maiden name, credit card numbers, personal financial data, medical or family information.<br><br>

We collect this information only if there is a compelling business reason-for example, if you want to charge a subscription payment to your credit card.  Such information will be used only for the stated purpose.<br><br>

As a business-to-business communications company, Intertec does not collect information from children. On-line registration for our subscriptions and web site usage is restricted to adults who are professionally engaged in the businesses we serve.<br><br>  
  

<b>We Honor Opt-Out Requests</b><br><br>

Intertec is committed to honoring all requests from customers who do not wish to receive mailings, telephone calls, e-mails, or faxes from our advertisers or any other third parties.<br><br>  

If you are a subscriber to an Intertec magazine and wish to restrict your mailing address and/or telephone number from our third party list rentals, call our Subscriber Customer Service Department at 800-441-0294  (913-967-1707 outside US).  Be sure to identify all Intertec magazines you receive, as each magazine maintains a separate mailing list.<br><br>

If you are a subscriber or registered web site user and have provided us with your e-mail address and/or fax number, we will notify you and offer you an opt-out opportunity before we send you any third party messages through our I-Lists Service.  You will also receive a further opt-out notice on every e-mail or fax message we send you.<br><br>

<b>Questions and Comments?</b><br><br>

Intertec Publishing has developed this Customer Privacy Policy out of respect for the preferences of our customers and prospects.  By using our web site, or registering for one of our other services, you consent to the collection and use of your information within the guidelines stated above.<br><br>

We will post any changes or extensions to this policy on this page, so you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.<br><br>

If you have questions or comments on our stated privacy policy, please <a href="mailto:privacy@intertec.com">contact us</a>.
