<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<a href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.echosign.com&amp;sealid=101" title="TRUSTe: Click to Verify" target="_blank" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px"><img src="/images/truste_seal_ctv.gif" width="68" height="95" alt="TRUSTe"></a>
<p>At EchoSign, Inc. (“EchoSign”), our top priority is protecting your privacy and the security of the Service. Our privacy policy is an integral part of our security policy and applies only to information collected by the Service. Here we discuss:</p>

<ul style="margin: 0 25px; padding: 10px 0 0;">
  <li>What types of personal information does EchoSign collect and why?</li>
  <li>In what very limited situations can any of your personal information be released?</li>
  <li>How does EchoSign protect your personal information?</li>
  <li>What privacy options do you have?</li>
</ul>

<h3>What types of personal information does EchoSign collect and why?</h3>

<h4>Information You Give Us</h4>

<h5>Registration</h5>
<p>When you register with EchoSign, you are required to provide contact information, including a name and e-mail address and phone number. We use this information to enable the exchange of documents through our service.</p>

<h5>Payment</h5>
<p>If you purchase a Paid Account, you are required to provide contact information and financial information. We use this information for billing purposes and for notifying users of any problems processing payment.</p>

<h5>E-mail Communications</h5>
<p>When you use our Service, you will receive electronic communications from EchoSign on a regular basis. You may sign up for these electronic communications when you register to use the EchoSign service. We use e-mail in order to verify account information, update you on features, products or offers related to the Service or third-party services, make service announcements, and address your customer service requests. Holders of Paid Accounts (as defined in the EchoSign Terms of Use) will generally not receive promotional e-mails.</p>

<h5>E-mail Referrals</h5>
<p>If you provide a friend’s name and address to EchoSign through our referral service, EchoSign will send your friend an e-mail invitation to visit our web site. We use this information for the purpose of sending invitations and tracking the effectiveness of referrals.</p>

<h5>Spam Policy</h5>
<p>EchoSign does not permit users to abuse the Service by sending unsolicited commercial faxes or by placing an unreasonable or disproportionate strain on the system. EchoSign reserves the right to employ any available means to prevent “junk faxes.”</p>

<h5>Surveys</h5>
<p>EchoSign occasionally conducts voluntary surveys, which collect contact information and demographic information in addition to your survey responses. We use this information in order to monitor and improve the Service. We may share demographic information with a partner or advertiser, but we aggregate such data so that your information is not personally identifiable.</p>

<h5>Testimonials</h5>
<p>When posting testamonials at www.echosign.com, any personally identifiable information (PII) that is submitted can be read, collected, or used by other users of this site, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit on the www.echosign.com website.</p>

<h5>Choice/Opt-out</h5>
<p>We provide you the opportunity to “opt-out” of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.</p>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:laura@echosign.com" title="Send an email to laura@echosign.com">laura@echosign.com</a>. We offer an opportunity to opt-out of certain communications on our account registration pages, or you may contact us at 650-352-5454, email <a href="mailto:laura@echosign.com" title="Send an email to laura@echosign.com">laura@echosign.com</a>, or send us written correspondence to EchoSign, 635 High St, Palo Alto, CA 94301 to opt-out.</p>
<p>You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.</p>

<h5>Tell-A-Friend</h5>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. EchoSign stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at www.echosign.com or email <a href="mailto:laura@echosign.com" title="Send an email to laura@echosign.com">laura@echosign.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

<h5>EchoSign Blog and Tips</h5>
<p>If you view or sign up to receive the EchoSign blog or EchoSign tips, you will be taken to a third party site which hosts this content.</p>

<h5>Contact Us</h5>
<p>The EchoSign contact us form is hosted by a third party service provider.</p>

<h4>Information EchoSign Automatically Collects</h4>

<h5>Log Information</h5>
<p>EchoSign’s servers track usage of the Service through log files. We use this information in order to analyze trends and gather aggregate demographic information (including IP addresses, browser type) that is not personally identifiable.</p>

<h5>Cookies</h5>
<p>A cookie is a small data file that contains information related to your usage of the Service. You do not need to enable cookies to use EchoSign. However, allowing them will improve the user experience. We use cookies to track, target and better understand how you use the Service, and to maintain, analyze and improve the overall quality of the Service. EchoSign uses both session cookies, which do not persist after you close the browser, and persistent cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive. We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>
<p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by EchoSign only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h5>Clear GIFs</h5>
<p>Clear GIFs are small graphic files about the size of a period which contain information related to your usage of the Service. We use clear GIFs to track, target and better understand how you use the Service, and to maintain, analyze and improve the overall quality of the Service. We also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mail communications in order to track the effectiveness of e-mail marketing.</p>

<h5>Profile</h5>
<p>EchoSign stores the information collected through log files, cookies, and clear GIFs in a profile containing each user’s viewing preferences. We use this information in order to identify your interests and improve the content provided by the Service.</p>

<h5>Third Party Content</h5>
<p>EchoSign may provide information regarding usage of the system (such as the number of times users view advertisements) to third party advertising partners. Ads generally do not appear on our Web sites or e-mails in the case of Paid Accounts. The information we share with third party advertisers is not personally identifiable.</p>
<p>The Service may contain links to third party websites. However, EchoSign does not control or take any responsibility for the information collected by other websites, including any affiliated or co-branded websites which link to the Service or advertise on the Service.</p>

<h5>Optional Opt-In, Anonymized Aggregated Data</h5>
<p>We allowed you to optionally “opt-in” to aggregated and anonymized document statistics including (but not limited to) industry type, number of documents sent, method of sending documents, percent of documents signed, and similar data in a non-personally identifiable manner to our users. This data is used to add value to our users by producing anonmyous benchmarking and industry trend observations. We do not disclose any information that could be used to identify you personally.</p>

<h5>Other Personal Information</h5>
<p>EchoSign reserves the right to obtain personally identifiable information about its users in order to provide the Services requested by its users. For example, EchoSign may obtain credit reports or verify billing information for credit card transactions. All personal information obtained from third parties will be maintained in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>In what very limited situations might EchoSign release your personal information?</h3>
<p>The EchoSign Service only distributes your communications, including faxes, e-signatures and e-mail as a passive, disinterested third party. EchoSign does not disclose, access, monitor, preserve or edit the contents of any of your communications. We do not share, sell, rent or trade personal identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes.</p><p>
</p><p>There are very limited situations related to law, safety or security when EchoSign may share your personal information with a third party. These limited situations are where EchoSign, in its sole discretion, reasonably believes that EchoSign is required to do so in order to: (1) satisfy any legal process, governmental request, applicable law or regulation; (2) prevent or investigate illegal activity, (3) enforce or investigate violations of the EchoSign Customer Agreement; or (4) protect the rights, property or safety of EchoSign, its users or the public. Subject to these exceptions, EchoSign will never disclose any information you upload or exchange through the Service.</p>
<p>In order to request any customer information not your own, EchoSign must be served with valid legal process, such as a subpoena, court order or warrant. Subpoenas should be sent to: EchoSign, Inc., Subpoena Department, 555 Bryant Street, #101, Palo Alto, CA 94301.</p>
<p>EchoSign may store and process your personal information at facilities in the United States. By using the Service, you consent to the transfer of information outside of your country. EchoSign may also access or process your communications for technical reasons if required to properly route the communication, satisfy technical requirements or network policies, meet your customer service requests, or prevent any disruption to the Service. When EchoSign bills customers for the Service, EchoSign provides your information to a credit card processing company. These credit card companies do not use, disclose or preserve personally identifiable information for any purpose other than billing.</p>
<p>In the event EchoSign goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, EchoSign’s users, and therefore their personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. If as a result of a business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given a choice not to have their information used in this different manner, as described below. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

<h3>How does EchoSign protect your personal information?</h3>
<p>Protecting your privacy and security is our top priority, and we take a wide range of precautions to maintain the security of the system. EchoSign protects your information online by using industry standard encryption methods to prevent unauthorized access to customer documents and account information stored on our servers. EchoSign protects your information off-line by restricting access to your information in our facilities. Only a necessary subset of our employees (such as billing or customer service personnel) are granted access to your personal information and only for legitimate business purposes related to their employment duties and serving you. EchoSign is committed to our service being Seriously Secure.</p>

<h3>What privacy options do you have?</h3>
<p>If your personal information changes, you may update or correct your account information at any time at the Account page. If you wish to terminate your account, you may also delete or deactivate your account at the Account page. However, residual copies of your account information may remain on our systems even after you delete personal information or deactivate your account.</p>
<p>You are responsible for periodically reviewing the current version of the Privacy Policy. EchoSign may amend its Privacy Policy at any time by (a) posting a revised Privacy Policy on the EchoSign website, or (b) sending information regarding the amendment to the email address you provide to EchoSign. Continued use of the Service will be deemed acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy. If there is a material change in the ownership or control of your personal information that affects how your personal information is protected, EchoSign will notify you of such changes by amending the Privacy Policy. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>

<h3>Safe Harbor Certification</h3>
<p>EchoSign is a participant in the Safe Harbor program developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union. We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles agreed upon by the U.S. and the E.U. For more information about the Safe Harbor and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor web site. In the event that any dispute arising out of or related to this policy is not settled by the parties, the parties will attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute by non-binding mediation in accordance with the American Arbitration Association Commercial Mediation Rules. No litigation for the resolution of such dispute may be commenced until the parties try in good faith to settle the dispute by such mediation in accordance with such rules and either party has concluded in good faith that amicable resolution through continued mediation of the matter does not appear likely. The parties to the mediation shall share the costs of mediation equally. Any settlement reached by mediation shall be recorded in writing, signed by the parties, and shall be binding on them.</p>
<p>EchoSign participates in the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce. As part of our participation we have agreed to EchoSign dispute resolution for disputes relating to our compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Framework.
