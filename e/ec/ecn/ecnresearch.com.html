            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            By visiting this web site you are accepting the practices described 
            in Iron Traffic, incorporated Privacy Policy. 
            <p>Iron Traffic, Inc. respects your privacy. Please be aware that 
              we appreciate the trust you place in us by providing information 
              on this web site, and our commitment to you is to use this information 
              with both care and sensitivity. The information we collect from 
              visitors to our web site helps us continually improve the products 
              we offer to our valued customers. Types of information collected 
              are outlined as follows:</p>
            <p>Any information you voluntarily enter on our web site is maintained 
              by Iron Traffic, Inc. to help us improve both the web site and product(s) 
              advertised on the web site.</p>
            <p>In addition, we use "cookies" (as do the vast majority of other 
              companies that do business on the World Wide Web) when you visit 
              our site, which are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to 
              your computer's hard drive through your web browser. Information 
              we collect and analyze via cookies includes the Internet Protocol 
              (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, computer 
              and connection information such as browser type and version, operating 
              system and platform, date and time of your visit, and cookie number. 
              If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer, please 
              review the options listed in the Help portion of the toolbar on 
              your computer. The toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to 
              prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the 
              browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable 
              cookies altogether.</p>
            <p>Iron Traffic Inc. periodically sends e-mail offers to its web site 
              visitors on behalf of other businesses. By providing information 
              on this web site, you are agreeing to receive these periodic e-mail 
              offers, which Iron Traffic, Inc. believes may be of interest to 
              you as a consumer. If you do not wish to receive e-mail offers from 
              us, please be sure to scroll down to the bottom of the first e-mail 
              you receive and click on the opt-out link provided, which will remove 
              your e-mail address from our database. You will then receive no 
              further e-mail communications from us. If you do not scroll down 
              to the bottom of the first e-mail you receive (or any e-mails thereafter), 
              you will continue to receive e-mail offers from Iron Traffic, Inc. 
              until you choose to click on the opt-out link that will be provided 
              in each e-mail you receive from us.</p>
            Other than companies we have partnered with, we will not release our 
            customers personal information. 
            <p align="justify">We will, however, release account and other personal 
              information when such release is necessary to comply with any state, 
              federal or international laws, or when, in our judgment, we determine 
              it to be necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of 
              Iron Traffic, Inc. or our valued customers. This includes exchanging 
              information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.</p>
