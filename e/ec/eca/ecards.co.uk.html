<br>
<br>ECards
<br>If you ask us to send an eCard (the "Services"), we need your name and email address and the name and email address of the person you are sending the eCard to. You must have the consent of the recipient to give us their name and email address and also any personal information you disclose in your message to them.  Providing this information is optional, but we cannot send an eCard on your behalf without you providing us with this information. 
<br>
<br>If you insert an image, including a photograph, into an eCard from a source other than the Website, you must have the consent of the person whose image it is and/or the owner of that image to use that image before it is inserted into an eCard and to allow us to store the image for use by you in future eCards from time to time.   In the case of images of children who are not capable of giving consent, you should ensure that the relevant consent is obtained from the child's parent or guardian.
<br>
<br>By inserting an image into an eCard from a source other than the Website, you confirm that you have obtained the necessary consents referred to in the above paragraph.  We do not accept any liability whatsoever for any image inserted by you into an eCard from a source other than the Website without the consent of the person, parent or guardian and/or owner (as the case may be). 
<br>
<br>If you are a recipient of an eCard then before you can open your eCard we will ask you to agree to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, by doing this you consent to us collecting, using and storing your personal information (including any image of you) in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
<br>
