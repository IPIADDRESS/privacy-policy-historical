<br>As well as the personal information that you provide us with, we will also use information obtained about you automatically from cookies (files which are sent by us to your computer). The main reason we use cookies is to gather information on how you and other users use our Website and Services.
<br>
<br>For example, cookies will tell us whether you viewed the Website with sound or with text on your last visit and will allow us to count the number of unique and return users to the Website.
<br>
<br>We may access cookies stored on your computer when you visit our Website in future or when you open an email from us.  We are able to do this by including web beacons (also known as clear GIFS or web bugs) in our emails.  If you want to delete any cookies that are already on your computer, please refer to the instructions for your file management software to locate the file or directory that stores cookies.  Our cookies will have the file name “__utmb.txt, __utmc.txt, __utmz.txt, vis.txt, PHPSESSID.txt, lang.txt, user_cookie.txt”.

<br>Our web beacons do not store additional information on your computer but, by communicating with our cookies on your computer, they can tell us when you have opened emails from us.  If you object to web beacons, we recommend that you follow the instructions for deleting existing cookies and disabling future cookies.  We will still know how many of our emails are opened and we will automatically receive your IP address, a unique identifier for your computer or other access device; but we will not identify you as an individual.

<br><b>Personal information, additional information and information collected via cookies</b>
<br>We use the sender's name and email address and the recipient's name and email address to send an eCard on the sender's behalf. We also use the sender's and recipient's information to notify the sender that we have sent the sender's card and that the sender's card has been read.

<br>We may pass the information you provide to us to third parties who may use this information to decide whether to advertise with us and/or ask us to contact you on their behalf and/or contact you directly with offers of products, services and information that may be of interest to you.  If you are a recipient of an eCard we will not use your data, which has been provided by a sender in order to send you an eCard, in this way.
<br>
<br>We contract with a third party to deliver emails to our database of users.  The third party is an accredited delivery platform which has been white listed with all major ISPs.
<br>
<br>At times, some information may be transferred to other countries including countries outside of the EU but we will always ensure that the country your personal information is transferred to has adequate levels of protection for your rights and freedoms in relation to processing such personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.
<br>
<br>We may disclose your personal information in order to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, such as a request by the police. We may also transfer your data in the event that our business (or part of it) is sold, and the purchaser needs the data to carry on providing services.
<br>
