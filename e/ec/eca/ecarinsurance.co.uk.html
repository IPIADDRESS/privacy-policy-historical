To provide you with a wide range of products and services we work closely with many insurers and services.&nbsp;<br>When we use these providers for your insurance and finance needs, we will endeavour to ensure that we have their agreement to collect and process your data on terms equivalent to those in this privacy policy and to use the information we provide only for the purpose(s) we provide it to them for.&nbsp;<br>Examples of who we need to share your data with are:&nbsp;<br>•<span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Insurers that provide insurance policies<br>•<span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Independent contractors we engage from time to time to ensure we meet and exceed industry standards.<br>•<span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Regulatory, governmental or other supervisory body to which we have to provide or give access.<br>•<span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Credit reference agencies, credit providers and debt collection agencies<br>•<span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Motor insurance, claims and underwriting databases<br>•<span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Anti-Fraud, theft and vehicle registers<br><br>If the products we offer require us to transfer your personal data to an insurer outside of the European Economic Area, we will impose contractual obligations to protect your personal data to the same standard required in the European Economic Area. We will also endeavour to choose insurers that subscribe to 'international frameworks' intended to enable secure data sharing between countries.<br>A full list of insurers we work with can be <a href="/privacy-security/brightside-third-party-list" target="_blank">found here</a>.</p><h4><strong>Credit searching and references&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Our insurers and credit providers need to have the necessary facts to assess your insurance risk, verify your identity, to help prevent fraud and to provide you with their best premium and payment options. Credit searching, scoring and referencing are methods that insurers and credit providers use to verify your information. By applying for a quotation, you agree to these uses of your information.<br>Public and personal data from a variety of sources, including a credit reference agency and other organisations are used at quotation and renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested. The credit referencing agencies record our enquiries but your credit standing will not be affected.<br>This search will appear on your credit report and will be visible to other credit providers. It will be clear that this is a quotation rather than a credit application by you to pay by monthly instalments.<br>Where automatic credit scoring computations are used, acceptance or rejection of your application will not depend the credit scoring process alone.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Anti-fraud registers&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>When dealing with your request for insurance, anti-fraud registers may be searched. We use a number of anti-fraud methods both at and after application including SIRA, a comprehensive fraud prevention and detection solution from Synectics Solutions. We will also pass details to the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register and the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, to check the information provided and prevent fraudulent claims. MIB is the data controller for the Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE) and Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud Theft Register (MIAFTR) databases.<br>Under the conditions of your policy, you must inform the insurer of any incident (such as an accident or a theft) which may, or may not, give rise to a claim. When you inform us of an incident, we’ll pass the information relating to it to the registers.<br>If we identify a discrepancy on the aforementioned registers which does not correspond to the information you have provided, we will apply the correct information to your policy and process this change as a mid-term adjustment. Where applicable, an additional premium will be charged by your insurer. If the correct information is unacceptable to your insurer, cover may be cancelled or voided (which means to treat as if the policy never existed).&nbsp;<br>We may detect and prevent fraudulent claims and/or activities by undertaking searches against your (or any person included on the proposal) Drivers Licence Number (DLN) against details held by the DVLA to confirm your licence status, entitlement and restriction information and endorsement/ conviction data. This helps insurer’s check information to prevent fraud and reduce incidences of negligent misrepresentation and non-disclosure. A search of the DLN with the DVLA should not show a footprint against your (or another relevant person included on the proposal) driving licence.</p><h4><strong>Information security</strong>&nbsp;</h4><p>How we protect your personal information from misuse and abuse is of great importance to us. We regularly review our technical and physical security procedures to protect your personal data from unauthorised access.<br>The Brightside website uses secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology to encrypt sensitive information such as your financial information. When you request a quote from us, we will process the data on a secure server.</p><h4><strong>Payment Security</strong></h4><p>When you purchase a policy, with your consent, your card and bank account details will be stored, safely in accordance with industry standards.&nbsp;<br>If you do not want your credit/debit card being used for this purpose you may contact our customer services team at any time to make alternative payment arrangements.</p><h4><strong>Motor Insurance Database (MID)</strong>&nbsp;</h4><p>Information relating to your motor insurance policy will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (“MID”) managed by the Motor Insurers Bureau (“MIB”). MID and the data stored on it may be used by certain statutory and/or authorised bodies including the Police, the DVLA, the DVA, the Insurance Fraud Bureau and other bodies permitted by law for purposes not limited to but including:<br>i)<span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Electronic Licensing<br>ii)<span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Continuous Insurance Enforcement<br>iii)<span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and/or prosecution of offenders)<br>iv)<span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>The provision of government services and/or services aimed at reducing the level and incidence of uninsured driving.<br>If you are involved in a road traffic incident (either in the UK, the EEA or certain other territories), insurers and/or the MIB may search the MID to obtain relevant information.<br>Persons (including his or her appointed representatives) pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic incident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID.<br>It is vital that the MID holds your correct registration number. If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your vehicle seized by the Police. You can check that your correct registration number details are shown on the MID at www.askmid.com.</p><h4><strong>Links to other websites&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Our website may contain links to other websites of interest.
