<p>Where you elect not to receive marketing information (whether this is all marketing or only marketing in relation to some areas) we would ask that you note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please allow 28 days for the relevant marketing communications to stop completely</li>

<li>This opt out relates to direct marketing only (i.e. marketing which uses your personal data), this will not stop marketing which is not targeted at you personally (for example a mail shot addressed ‘To the Occupier’ where the occupier is not a customer of KCOM)</li>
</ul>
<p>We use third parties to help us manage our marketing database and marketing campaigns and so will share your personal information with them. These companies are:</p>
