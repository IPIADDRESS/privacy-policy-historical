                        					We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use the Channel 4 Online Services. To do this, we may use web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on a Channel 4 Online Service. The type of information we collect includes content viewed, pages, site sections and videos. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see and the number of users responding to campaigns. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from a Channel 4 Online Service on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve the Channel 4 Online Services, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of this website analysis tool by clicking on the following link: <a href="http://webstat.channel4.com/optout.html">http://webstat.channel4.com/optout.html</a>.
