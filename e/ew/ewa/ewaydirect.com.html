		<h1 class="contentPageTitle2">Privacy Policy</h1>
		<div class="contentPageContent1">
			eWayDirect, Inc. places the highest level of importance on respecting the privacy of our clients and their customers. 
			Each of our employees is dedicated to maintaining the security of client data. This privacy statement describes how your personal 
			information is collected and used and applies to the eWayDirect website, products and services.
			<br><br>
			<h2 class="contentPageSubTitle2">Security &amp; Privacy</h2>
			Only employees, in the course of their day-to-day operations, may have access to this private information. 
			Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including 
			possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution.
`			<br><br>
			Be aware that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief 
			that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Website.
			<br><br>
			To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to 
			provide your personal information to third parties as part of legal process.
			<br><br>
			<h2 class="contentPageSubTitle2">Information Collection and Use on our Website</h2>
			eWayDirect is the sole owner of the information collected at our site. We do not sell, share, or rent information to third parties. 
			The information is used to determine the most appropriate information to send to those who request it.
			<br><br>
			The website provides users with registration forms offering the opportunity to request information, demonstrations and to join our mailing list. 
			These forms require users to provide contact information.
			<br><br>
			We collect visitor IP addresses in log files to monitor our site. IP addresses are anonymous and are not linked to personal information.
			<br><br>
			We may share aggregated data with clients or partners. This does not include information that can identify any individual person. 
			Nor does it disclose confidential or proprietary client information.
			<br><br>
			<h2 class="contentPageSubTitle2">Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
			eWayDirect uses cookies to make it easier to navigate our web site and to track and measure the results of a particular marketing campaign. 
			Cookies are small text files placed on a visitor's hard disk and allow eWayDirect to remember the visitor to our web site. When you visit our 
			web site or open our email, we may send you a cookie. The cookies placed by eWayDirect are only readable by eWayDirect. 
			Cookies are not able to access, read or modify any other data on a computer. If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website 
			you may either set your browser to alert you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie or set your browser to refuse all cookies. 
			By not accepting the cookie, you may not be able to take full advantage of our website.
			<br><br>
			The eWayDirect website and emails may also use web beacons. Web beacons are tiny graphic images on web pages or in emails that notify 
			the server anonymously when that page has been visited or the email has been opened. Web beacons are used together with Cookies to let us 
			know which pages are of interest to visitors. If Cookies are disabled, web beacons continue to send anonymous notice of a visit but 
			cannot associate that with other information.
			<br><br>
			Some of our business partners, such as our Web analytics provider, also use cookies on our site. These cookies are used to track visitor behavior, 
			and eWayDirect has no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by eWayDirect only and does not cover 
			the use of cookies by any third parties.
			<br><br>
			<h2 class="contentPageSubTitle2">Opt-Out and Update</h2>
			All non-transactional email sent by eWayDirect, either for its own business or on behalf of its clients will contain clear and concise instructions 
			(such as clicking on the link at the bottom of an email) for how to opt-out of receiving future communications. People clicking on this link will 
			be opted-out of future mailings.
			<br><br>
			Any visitor to the eWayDirect web site has the ability to maintain anonymity and privacy by choosing to disable Cookies in their web browser.
			<br><br>
			In addition, upon request, and after receiving proof of identity, we provide people with access to any and all information that we maintain about 
			them individually. People then have the ability to request that we correct or remove their contact information and we will do so. All requests 
			will be honored within 30 days of the user notification and proof of identity.
			<br><br>
			<h2 class="contentPageSubTitle2">Hosting and Processing Client Data</h2>
			eWayDirect delivers permission-based electronic marketing campaigns on behalf of our clients. Campaigns are sent only to people who have agreed to 
			receive these emails. In doing so:
			<br><br>
			eWayDirect stores information in the form of database lists provided to it by its clients and processes that information under the direction of its 
			clients. These lists may contain email addresses, street addresses, contact information and other information. Confidentiality of the client list is 
			a top priority and they are never shared with other clients or third parties.
			<br><br>
			eWayDirect acts as a data processor when hosting client data and sending emails on behalf of our clients. eWayDirect has no direct relationship with the 
			individuals whose personal data it processes and therefore, any individual who seeks access to, or who seeks to correct, modify, or delete inaccurate 
			data should direct his query to the data controller, which is the eWayDirect client. If the client requests eWayDirect to remove the data, we will 
			respond to their request within 30 days.
			<br><br>
			We track a recipient's ability to support HTML email, as well as whether an HTML email message has been opened or previewed. 
			This capability is used to deliver relevant content to the recipient.
			<br><br>
			We collect information regarding the activity of email recipients, which is only reported to the client who owns the list.
			<br><br>
			If eWayDirect determines a client has knowingly used our system for sending unsolicited email, we may revoke the right of this client to use our system.
			<br><br>
			eWayDirect does not sell, share, or rent the mailing lists of our clients. Content Guidelines
			<br><br>
