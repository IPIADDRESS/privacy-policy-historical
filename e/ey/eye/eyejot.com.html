</p><h3>Information Relating to Children</h3>
<p>
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age. The Eyejot Sites, Products and Services are not directed at children under 13 years of age but, we recognize that with proper adult supervision some parents might permit their children to visit and utilize the Eyejot Sites, Products and Services. COPPA requires that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of the Eyejot Sites, Products and Services.
</p><p>
When your child attempts to register and/or provide personal information to Eyejot (including on any of the Eyejot Sites, Products and Services), we require a parent or legal guardian to:
</p><ul>
<li>complete the registration;
</li><li>review our privacy policy;
</li><li>and verify through the use of an email confirmation that the parent or guardian consents to any applicable Terms of Service and this privacy policy.
</li></ul>
<p>
Once parental notice and consent has been verified, the information we collect will be treated the same as information collected from any other user of the Eyejot Sites, Products and Services. Without verified parental notice and consent, we will not knowingly collect personal information of children under 13 years of age, and if we learn that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will promptly delete it.

</p><h3>How Parents can Access their Children's Personal Information</h3>
In compliance with COPPA, parents and legal guardians may request us to review, delete or stop the collection of the personally identifiable information of their child. You may do so in one of two ways.
<p>
If you know the user name and password, follow the instructions below regarding Changing your Preferences and Personal Information, or you may contact us by letter, phone or email using the address information provided at the bottom of this page.
</p><p>
If you request that no further information about your child be collected or used, we will be required to terminate your child's ability to use the Eyejot Sites, Products and Services that require a user to "sign in."
