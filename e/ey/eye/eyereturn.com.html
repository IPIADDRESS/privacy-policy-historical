        <p><strong>Our commitment to privacy:</strong>  eyeReturn Marketing Inc. ("eyeReturn"), knows that protecting the privacy and confidentiality of your information is important to you. This Privacy Code governs the collection, use and disclosure of your information in any form, whether written or electronic, by eyeReturn. This Privacy Code explains what information may be collected from you and how it is used. It also explains how you can ask questions, make suggestions, and express concerns about our privacy practices. </p>
        <p>This Privacy Code applies only to the information collected by eyeReturn . The collection, use and disclosure of your personal information is governed by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (the “Act”), and any applicable provincial legislation.  eyeReturn does not collect any personally identifying information in connection with the delivery of our clients’ advertisements, nor from the websites on which those advertisements appear.</p>

        <p>Be aware that our websites may contain links to other websites that are maintained by third parties who are not required to comply with this Privacy Code and for which eyeReturn has no responsibility. Please review the privacy policies on any external websites to determine their information handling practices.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Code is available to the public through our website, and in paper form from eyeReturn. If you have any additional concerns or questions, we encourage you to contact us and we will address your concerns to the best of our ability. <strong>Please read this Privacy Code carefully, and check back periodically as we may update it from time to time.  By submitting your personal information to eyeReturn, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Code.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>What is personal information?</strong> Personal information is any information about an identifiable individual.</p>
        <p>eyeReturn is responsible for personal information under its control. eyeReturn has implemented policies and practices to give effect to this Privacy Code, including training and communicating with our employees about the importance of privacy and implementing security procedures that reasonably protect the personal information you provide to us.  In addition, eyeReturn has appointed a Privacy Officer to oversee personal information-handling practices at eyeReturn.</p>
        <p><strong>What is excluded from privacy protection?</strong> This Privacy Code does not impose restrictions on: business contact information, including the name, title, business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization; information collected, used or disclosed solely for journalistic, literary or artistic purposes; publicly available information, such as an individual’s name, telephone number and address when listed in a directory or made available through directory assistance; or information that is aggregated and not associated with a specific individual, including demographic information and statistics. </p>
        <p><strong>Children:</strong> If you are under the age of 18, be sure to obtain your parent or guardian’s permission before you send any information to us, or anyone else. We encourage parents to get involved with their children’s online usage and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating.</p>

        <p><strong>What information do we collect, and why?</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>eyeReturn operates contests and promotions on behalf of its clients. If you enter a contest or other promotion, any personally identifiable information collected belongs solely to the client and will be used solely in accordance with that particular client’s privacy code.  eyeReturn will only use your personal contact information to administer the contest or promotion including contacting, announcing and promoting prize winners.  </li>
            <li>eyeReturn serves advertisements from hundreds of third party advertisers across numerous publisher websites. When you visit one of the publishers’ websites, eyeReturn’s automated system may collect “click stream data” related to your visit to the website. Click stream data is anonymous and can include information such as web pages viewed, the date and time those pages were viewed, banner advertisements that were shown and your interaction with content and advertisements on those websites. This information can also be used for online preference marketing purposes. Technologies used to collect this stream data include cookies, web beacons or pixels.</li>
            <li>We collect demographic information, as well as ads served to you and your response thereto, in order to gain a better understanding of your interests so that we may develop better products and services, and to determine your eligibility for other products and services on behalf of our clients.</li>
            <li>If you use a publishers’ websites where eyeReturn is serving an ad, we may assign an internet cookie. An internet cookie is a unique random number that is assigned to your internet browser that can collect and store information. We use cookies to better understand how you use our websites, to make sure our ads and dynamic content are served correctly and to improve the performance of our websites. For example, a cookie may recall an ad that you have seen so that you do not see the same ad over and over--thus enhancing your website viewing experience. Storing cookies on your web browser allows us to present you with web pages and other content that are attuned with your preferences. These activities are invisible to you, and are generally intended to improve your internet surfing convenience. Unless you have set your preferences so that you will be alerted when a cookie is being stored on your computer, you won’t know about it. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on these publishers’ website. </li>
            <li>If you are concerned about cookies, it is possible to turn them off in your web browser preferences. However, please be aware that by disabling cookies, you may not be able to use all portions of our websites or a publisher’s websites, particularly pages requiring registration.</li>
            <li>We may place advertising or other links on our websites or the websites of publishers who have contracted with us to deliver advertising that originate from outside advertisers. If you view these ads, the advertisers may assign a cookie. eyeReturn does not control these cookies, nor is it responsible for any marketing or other use of your information by these third-party advertisers.</li>
            <li>Publishers’ websites may use Web beacon, gif, pixel, or other technologies to better tailor and manage advertising on those sites. These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across web sites. When you access these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our suppliers. These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you don’t want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies. If you turn off cookies, Web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a></li>

            <li>We may from time to time use IP (internet protocol) addresses, to gather demographic and statistical information about our users, for systems administration and to diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our websites. We may also use IP addresses to display or allow our third party advertising providers to display more targeted advertising and content.</li>
            <li>We may, from time to time, track and analyze anonymous usage and browsing patterns of visitors to our websites to provide our advertisers with more targeted advertising opportunities and to help users see advertising that is most likely to interest them.</li>
            <li>If you choose to opt-out of any use of your information in accordance with our opt-out policy, we will keep your contact information on a list so that your request can be honoured. If you provide a complaint to any of our departments, we will collect your contact information and the nature of your complaint, for the purpose of investigating your concerns and responding to you.</li>
            <li>Other than as permitted or required by law, if we wish to collect, use or disclose your information for purposes that are not contemplated in this Privacy Code, we will identify those purposes at the time of collection. You will be given a reasonable opportunity to opt-out of any such additional purposes. </li>
        </ul>

        <li>Your information may be processed and stored outside of the province in which you reside and/or outside of Canada by us, an affiliate or a third party service provider for the purposes set out in this Privacy Code and, under the laws of these other jurisdictions, in certain circumstances foreign courts, law enforcement agencies or regulatory agencies may be entitled to access your information.</li>
        <li>eyeReturn may disclose your information to third parties if you have violated our terms of service, or if we need to comply with applicable laws and lawful governmental requests, other legal and regulatory authorities and for other legal reasons. </li>
        </ul>
