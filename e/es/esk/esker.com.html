Esker recommends you contact these third parties directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection, and distribution policies.</p><p><b>Third Party Websites.</b> As a convenience to you, the Services and Esker Websites may contain links to a number of other third-party websites that Esker believes may offer useful information.

Esker recommends you contact those websites directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection, and distribution policies.</p><h2>CHOICE</h2><p>When you use the Services, Esker offers its customers a choice to opt-out of uses and disclosures of their data that are incompatible with the purposes for which that data was originally collected or subsequently authorized. Esker operates under the assumption that it is generally your obligation as data controller to obtain from your customers the appropriate consent to transfer and process their data to Esker. As your data processor, Esker will not share, sell, rent, or trade with third parties for their marketing purposes any of your data or your customer's data collected by us, unless you direct us to do so and have the appropriate authorization to do so.

In the event that Sensitive Personal Information is to be used for a new purpose or transferred to the control of a third party not acting as an agent of Esker's, the data subject's explicit consent will be obtained prior to the new use or transfer of the data, unless such new use or transfer is: (1) in the vital interests of the data subject or another person; (2) necessary for the establishment of Esker's legal claims of defenses; (3) required to provide medical care or diagnosis; (4) necessary to carry out Esker's obligations in the field of employment law; or (5) related to data that are manifestly made public by the data subject. In these cases, data subjects are given notice of such use.</p><h2>ACCOUNTABILITY OF ONWARD TRANSFER</h2><p>Except as described in this Policy, Esker will not share your Personal Information with third-party agents without your consent. In those instances in which Esker shares Personal Information, Esker will ensure that the third-party agent is contractually obligated to process your Personal Information only for limited, specific purposes consistent with this Policy. Esker will also ensure that the third-party agent will apply the same level of protection to your Personal Information as the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles and will notify Esker and stop processing your Personal Information if they make a determination that they can no longer meet their obligations. Esker remains responsible and liable under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the Personal Information on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, unless Esker proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p><h2>SECURITY</h2><p>Esker takes reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and organizational precautions to protect your Personal Information in its possession from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

Additionally, Esker annually trains its employees on the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles, the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework, this Policy, its other internal security policies, and makes this Policy available to Esker's business partners.

Esker takes reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures to ensure that Personal Information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, reliable, and current. Esker will retain the Personal Information for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the Personal Information was collected or for which it is to be further processed.

Upon the termination of the Services, Esker discards any record with Personal Information as well as those provided to third parties.
