	<br>
	At C&amp;S Technologies, Inc. (referred to as C&amp;S, "us" or "we" in this 
	Privacy Statement), we are dedicated to serving your needs. We know you care 
	about your personal privacy. Because we care about you we have adopted the 
	practices described in this Privacy Statement.<br>
	<br>
	Our Collection and Use of Your Personally Identifiable Information.<br>
	<br>
	We collect and use information about you where we reasonably believe it will 
	help us administer our business or provide products, services or other 
	opportunities to you. The information you give us allows us to improve our 
	marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze Site usage, improve 
	our content and product offerings and customize our Site's content, layout and 
	Services. Because of the nature of our business our products and services are 
	not designed to appeal to minors, we do not knowingly attempt to solicit or 
	receive any information from children.<br>
	<br>
	It will be necessary for you to provide your birthday, social security number, 
	employment, income and related tax payment information for our software to 
	compute and complete your tax return for e-file. We use tax return information 
	only in accordance with applicable laws and in order to provide the tax return 
	and electronic filing or other services you have requested. Except as described 
	herein we do not disclose tax return information to third parties nor use it to 
	market third parties' products and services. For our records, we may, in our 
	sole discretion, retain original and updated information for reasons such as 
	technical constraints, dispute resolution, troubleshooting and agreement 
	enforcement.<br>
	<br>
	C&amp;S collects information from our users at several different points, 
	including but not limited to the following: <blockquote> <b>Information You Provide To 
			Us</b><br>
		Before you can use the Services (as defined in the User Agreement) on the Site, 
		we ask that you register with C&amp;S and provide to us your Username, e-mail 
		address, Password, Name, Address, Phone Number, Password Prompt Question and 
		Answer. We receive and may store the information you provide to us. Certain 
		information, such as your name and your password must be given to us to access 
		the Site. Other information may be identified as optional, and you may choose 
		whether to provide it. However, if you choose not to provide certain optional 
		information please be aware that it may result in certain features and services 
		not being available to you.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Correspondence</b><br>
		If you correspond with us we may retain such information. In addition, where we 
		have sent an email to you, we may receive confirmation that you have opened it.<br>
		<br>
		<b>URL and IP address</b><br>
		Like many other websites, we collect information about our users' utilization 
		and navigation of our Site. This information helps us to design our Site to 
		better suit our users' needs. We also use your IP address to help diagnose 
		problems with our server and to administer our Site, to gather broad 
		demographic information and to help identify you. Please note, the Internal 
		Revenue Service requires us to provide it with the Internet Protocol address of 
		the computer from which the return originated whenever the tax return is filed 
		electronically.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Cookies</b><br>
		Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a user's hard 
		drive for record-keeping purposes. Like many websites, we use cookies at our 
		Site. Cookies can make using the Internet easier by, among other things, saving 
		your passwords and preferences for you. For example, a cookie lets the Site 
		remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future 
		activities at our Site, and which allows you to enter your password/log in ID 
		less frequently when visiting our Site. We may also use cookies to deliver 
		content specific to your interests. There are products commercially available 
		that are designed to help you disable cookies. Although we want you to be aware 
		that such products exist, please note that if you choose to use them we may not 
		be able to provide you with personalized service, your use of the Site may be 
		slowed, and it may result in certain features and services not being available 
		to you.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b><br>
		From time-to-time, our Site may request information from you via surveys or 
		contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary 
		and you may choose whether or not to disclose this information. Information 
		requested may include but is not limited to contact information (such as name 
		and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age 
		level).<br>
		<br>
		<b>Information from Other Sources</b><br>
		We may receive information about you from other sources, such as our agents, 
		vendors and service providers and from publicly available sources. For example, 
		sometimes we receive updated address information from third parties that we may 
		use to update our records.<br>
		<br>
	</blockquote><b>Restrictions on Disclosing Information To Third Parties.</b><br>
	<br>
	We are not in the business of selling or renting your personally identifiable 
	information to others. We do not reveal personally identifiable information 
	about you to third parties (outside of any affiliate or subsidiary we may have) 
	for their independent use unless: (1) you request or authorize it; (2) the 
	information is provided to help provide a service or complete a transaction for 
	you; (3) the information is provided to comply with the law, enforce our User 
	Agreement or other agreements we have with you, or to protect our rights, 
	property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of others; (4) the 
	disclosure is done as part of a purchase, sale or transfer of services or 
	assets (for example, if substantially all of our assets are acquired by another 
	party, your information may be one of the transferred assets); or (5) the 
	information is provided to our agents, vendors or service providers who perform 
	functions on our behalf. We may also gather aggregated data about you and 
	disclose the results of such aggregated (but not personally identifiable) 
	information to third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.<br>
