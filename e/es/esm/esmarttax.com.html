We know you care about your personal privacy. Because we care about you we have adopted the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</strong>

							<div class="mainbodytext">
<!-- Covered Website -->
								<p><span class="subtitle">Covered Website</span></p>
									<p>This Privacy Policy applies to use of our online income tax preparation service.  It does not apply to other portions of our website or to services offered through our office locations.</p>
<!-- The Information We Collect -->
								<p><span class="subtitle">The Information We Collect</span></p>
									<p>We collect your tax related information such as your name, address, income, birth date, social security number, employment and other information necessary to prepare and electronically file your tax return.  You also provide to us your Username, Password, Password Prompt Question, e-mail address and telephone number as part of the registration process to use this service.  We also collect the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer from which the return originated (see discussion under “URL and IP Address” below).   If you pay by credit card, we also collect your credit card type, number, and expiration date.  If you pay by e-check or request direct deposit of your tax refund, we collect the bank name, and bank account and routing number. </p>
<!-- The Way We Use Information -->
								<p><span class="subtitle">The Way We Use Information</span></p>
									<p>The tax return information that we collect is used to prepare and, if requested, electronically file your tax return.  The tax return information is used only as authorized by you or as allowed by law.</p>
									<p>The IRS requires us to provide to them the IP address of the computer from which the return originated, as well as the e-mail address of the person who electronically filed the return.</p>
									<p>Your credit card information or bank account information will be shared with credit card processing companies to bill you for services purchased.</p>
									<p>The information you give us also allows us to statistically analyze Site usage, improve our content and product offerings and customize our Site's content, layout and services. </p>
									<p>We will send you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  For instance, we might send you an e-mail announce the start of the IRS filing season and our service each year, the filing status and result for your tax return, actions required to complete your e-file, or if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance. </p>
									<p>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications because our tax e-file services include e-file, processing, submission, result analysis and possibly resubmission required for the tax return.  Without these communication, you may not find out if the tax return has been accepted by the IRS or not, resulting in refund delay or other difficulties. </p>
									<p>We will send you tax related information in a newsletter to your email address if you have authorized it.</p>
<!-- Choice/Opt-Out -->
								<p><span class="subtitle">Choice/Opt-Out</span></p>
									<p>If you do not wish to receive tax information, including the newsletter, you may opt-out of receiving it by following the instructions included in each email or on the Update Profile page by visiting the following URL:  <a href="https://libertytax.esmarttax.com/ChangePersonalProfile.asp">https://libertytax.esmarttax.com/ChangePersonalProfile.asp</a>. </p>
<!-- Restrictions on Disclosing Information To Third Parties. -->
								<p><span class="subtitle">Restrictions on Disclosing Information To Third Parties.</span></p>
									<p>We are not in the business of selling or renting your personally identifiable information to others. We do not reveal personally identifiable information about you to third parties (outside of any affiliate or subsidiary we may have) for their independent use unless: (1) you request or authorize it; (2) the information is provided to complete a transaction for you; (3) the information is provided to comply with the law or in response to a subpoena or other legal process; or (4) the disclosure is done as part of a purchase, sale or transfer of services or assets (for example, if substantially all of our assets are acquired by another party, your information may be one of the transferred assets). </p>
<!-- URL and IP Address -->
								<p><span class="subtitle">URL and IP Address</span></p>
									<p>Like many other websites, we collect information about our users' utilization and navigation of our Site through the use of log files.  This information helps us to design our Site to better suit our users' needs.  We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Site, to gather broad demographic information and to help identify you.  Our log files are tied to your personally identifiable information in order to facilitate the resolution of Site and user-specific problems.</p>

									<p>Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a user's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.  Like many websites, we use cookies at our Site.  Cookies can make using the Internet easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you.  For example, a cookie lets the Site remember that you have registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our Site, and which allows you to enter your password/login ID less frequently when visiting our Site.  Cookies allow us to track the user's activities and to determine the customer's preference.  You may choose to decline the cookie, however by doing so, you may be limited to access some parts of the website.

We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. </p>
<!-- Security Measures to Protect Information -->
								<p><span class="subtitle">Security Measures to Protect Information</span></p>
									<p>To help protect the privacy of data you transmit through use of this Site, Liberty Tax Service uses security policies and procedures that include administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to (a) ensure the security and confidentiality of nonpublic customer information, (b) protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security of such nonpublic customer information, and (c) protect against unauthorized access or use of such nonpublic customer information.   All transmissions of your tax return and credit card information between your computer and our website are SSL encrypted.  We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis.  In addition, we train our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the security of your information.  We commit to taking appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce our employee's privacy responsibilities.  It is also important for you to help protect against unauthorized access by signing off of our Site each time you finish using it. </p>
<!-- Your Access To Your Personally Identifiable Information -->
								<p><span class="subtitle">Your Access To Your Personally Identifiable Information</span></p>
									<p>We provide you with access to certain of your personally identifiable information in our database.

									<p>By using this Site you agree to the terms and conditions in this Privacy Policy and the Liberty Tax Service User Agreement also provided on this site.  It is our goal to make our policies easy to understand.  While we try to maintain consistent policies between our Privacy Policy and our User Agreement, there may be a case where the two policies conflict.  In those rare instances, the User Agreement shall be the controlling document. </p>
									<p>As our business changes from time to time, this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement are expected to change.  We reserve the right to amend the Privacy Policy and User Agreement at any time, for any reason.
