(referred to as C&amp;S, "us" or "we" in this Privacy Statement), we are dedicated to serving your needs. We know you care about your personal privacy. Because we care about you we have adopted the practices described in this Privacy Statement.</strong>							
						</div><br><br>

						<div class="mainbodytext">
							<p><span class="subtitle">Our Collection and Use of Your Personally Identifiable Information.</span></p>
								<p>
We collect and use information about you where we reasonably believe it will help us administer our business or provide products, services or other opportunities to you. The information you give us allows us to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze Site usage, improve our content and product offerings and customize our Site's content, layout and Services. Because of the nature of our business our products and services are not designed to appeal to minors, we do not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children.									
								</p>
								<p>
It will be necessary for you to provide your birthday, social security number, employment, income and related tax payment information for our software to compute and complete your tax return for e-file. We use tax return information only in accordance with applicable laws and in order to provide the tax return and electronic filing or other services you have requested. Except as described herein we do not disclose tax return information to third parties nor use it to market third parties' products and services. For our records, we may, in our sole discretion, retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, troubleshooting and agreement enforcement.									
								</p>
								<p>
C&amp;S collects information from our users at several									different points, including but not limited to the following:									
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										<span class="subtitle">Information You Provide To Us</span><br>
Before you can use the Services (as defined in the User Agreement) on the Site, we ask that you register with C&amp;S and provide to us your Username, e-mail address, Password, Name, Address, Phone Number, Password Prompt Question and Answer. We receive and may store the information you provide to us. Certain information, such as your name and your password must be given to us to access the Site. Other information may be identified as optional, and you may choose whether to provide it. However, if you choose not to provide certain optional information please be aware that it may result in certain features and services not being available to you.											
										
									</p>
									<!--<p>
									'	<span class="subtitle">Correspondence</span><br>
																				
									'	</p> -->

									<p> 
										<span class="subtitle">Choice/Opt-Out</span><br>
If you no longer wish to receive information regarding our products and promotional programs, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each mail or on the Update Profile page by visiting the following URL: <a href="https://www.eSMARTtax.com/ChangePersonalProfile.asp" title="Change Personal Profile">https://www.eSMARTtax.com/ChangePersonalProfile.asp</a>.																				
										</p>

									<p>
										<span class="subtitle">Service-related Announcements</span><br>
We will send you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  For instance, we might send you an e-mail announce the start of the IRS filing season and our service each year, the filing status and result for your tax return, actions required to complete your e-file, or if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance.																				
									
										</p>
										<p>
Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications because our tax e-file services includes e-file, processing, submission, result analysis and possibly resubmission required for the tax return.   Without these communication, you may not find out if the tax return has been accepted by the IRS or not, resulting in refund delay or other difficulties.										
										</p>

									<p>
										<span class="subtitle">URL and IP address</span><br>
Like many other websites, we collect information about our users' utilization and navigation of our Site. This information helps us to design our Site to better suit our users' needs. We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Site, to gather broad demographic information and to help identify you. Please note, the Internal Revenue Service requires us to provide it with the Internet Protocol address of the computer from which the return originated whenever the tax return is filed electronically.																				
									
										</p>
									<p>
										<span class="subtitle">Cookies</span><br>
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a user's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Like many websites, we use cookies at our Site. Cookies can make using the Internet easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you. For example, a cookie lets the Site remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our Site, and which allows you to enter your password/log in ID less frequently when visiting our Site. Cookies allow us to track the user's activities and to determine the customer's preference. You may choose to decline the cookie, however by doing so, you may be limited to access some parts of the website. We may also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. There are products commercially available that are designed to help you disable cookies. Although we want you to be aware that such products exist, please note that if you choose to use them we may not be able to provide you with personalized service, your use of the Site may be slowed, and it may result in certain features and services not being available to you. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.																				
									
										</p>
									<p>
										<span class="subtitle">Surveys &amp; Contests</span><br>
From time-to-time, our Site may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you may choose whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include but is not limited to contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level).																				
									
										</p>
									<p>
										<span class="subtitle">Information from Other Sources</span><br>
We may receive information about you from other sources, such as our agents, vendors and service providers and from publicly available sources. For example, sometimes we receive updated address information from third parties that we may use to update our records.
