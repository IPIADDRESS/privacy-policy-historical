<a name="eztoc21805_0_1_2_1" id="eztoc21805_0_1_2_1"></a><h4>Mandatory Personal Information</h4><p>As a general rule, to enable ESMO to correctly identify you, to provide you with the products and services you have requested and to communicate with you, the following minimum information must be provided in order for your order, request, application, etc. to be processed:</p>
<ul>

<li>Title</li>

<li>First Name(s)</li>

<li>Last Name(s)</li>

<li>Full Postal Address (work)</li>

<li>Email address</li>

<li>Gender</li>

</ul>

<a name="eztoc21805_0_1_2_2" id="eztoc21805_0_1_2_2"></a><h4>Optional Personal Information</h4><p>Other personal information may be requested to help identification (eg date of birth, nationality by country, etc.) or to enable ESMO to understand your profile so you can be provided with better and more appropriate products and services (eg Professional Interests and Topics of Interest).</p>
<a name="eztoc21805_0_1_2_3" id="eztoc21805_0_1_2_3"></a><h4>Credit Card Information</h4><p>
Credit Card information, along with other information related to specific transactions, is collected at the time of your order, request or application, and is used only for the purposes of that particular transaction. For your protection, the Credit Card information is not retained in ESMO system for later use for other transactions. The record of the transaction is kept for 10 years for legal and audit reasons.<br>ESMO takes every precaution to ensure that this information is stored in a safe location and that it cannot be accessed by unauthorised parties. For further information about security, please refer to Data Security.</p>
<a name="eztoc21805_0_1_2_4" id="eztoc21805_0_1_2_4"></a><h4>Email address information</h4><p>
Your email address is mandatory when you use ESMO electronic services on the ESMO Web Site<br>
Electronic communication is for most purposes ESMO’s preferred method of communication because it is generally convenient, rapid, environmentally friendly and efficient<br>
You are required to supply your email address when you create your ‘My ESMO’ account on ESMO Web Site, which enables you to access a variety of services online.<br>Please note that each email address must be unique and that you are not allowed to share email addresses with another person.</p>
<a name="eztoc21805_0_1_2_5" id="eztoc21805_0_1_2_5"></a><h4>Unique Email Address</h4><p>
For your convenience and security, your email address is unique to you in the system. (ESMO does not permit two different persons to have the same email address in the system). You are strongly recommended to use an email address which is personal to you and that is not shared with others. This is to ensure that communications which are sent to you personally are not read by others, and that others do not gain access to the information in your ‘My ESMO’ account. Furthermore, ESMO may use your email address to communicate with you about value added products linked either to your membership or your congress attendance.<br>Your unique email permits automated retrieval of your login details, which are sent to your personal email address.</p>
<a name="eztoc21805_0_1_2_6" id="eztoc21805_0_1_2_6"></a><h4>Data from surveys and questionnaires</h4><p>ESMO conducts a number of surveys or questionnaires every year whereby we collect data from volunteer respondents about a certain number of topics that are of interest to us as a society or to the practice of oncology. The respondent data remains completely anonymous, unless the respondents specifically choose to share their contact data. Upon completion of the survey or questionnaire, to ensure confidentiality, information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to the survey tool platform. Data entered are stored on the survey tool server, which is accessible through a dedicated ESMO account only. When exported, data are stored on ESMO's internal server. To ensure the complete anonymity of all respondents, all data collected are kept confidential and no individual respondent’s answers will be disclosed at any time by ESMO or Rare Cancers Europe.</p>
<a name="eztoc21805_0_1_3" id="eztoc21805_0_1_3"></a><h3>How ESMO uses personal information</h3><p>

</ul>
<p>
You can manage the extent to which ESMO communicates with you by using the e-News section in your ‘My ESMO’ homepage. Here you are asked to indicate whether or not you wish to receive ESMO generated emails.<br>
If you decide that you do wish to receive email communications from ESMO you can select which categories of news interest you. All mailings sent to you offer the possibility to unsubscribe.<br>If you indicate that you do not wish to receive ESMO generated emails you will only receive emails directly related to the transactions you have with ESMO (eg confirmation of registration, membership renewal, etc.) and other necessary individual communications.</p>
<a name="eztoc21805_0_1_3_7" id="eztoc21805_0_1_3_7"></a><h4>How long personal information is kept</h4><p>
Personal information supplied during a transaction with ESMO: As a general rule, personal information is kept for 10 years as from the moment of transacting with ESMO.<br>This limit does not apply to ESMO Committee members, whose personal information is kept for indefinitely.</p>
<a name="eztoc21805_0_1_3_8" id="eztoc21805_0_1_3_8"></a><h4>Disclosure of information and marketing</h4><p>

ESMO staff and contractors have a responsibility to keep your information confidential.<br>
ESMO may supply your information to its contractors to perform specific services (such as to the publishers to deliver ESMO journals, etc.). Otherwise, ESMO does not disclose personal information to any other person or organisation without your consent.<br>If you are a delegate at an ESMO organised Congress or meeting, and you visit exhibiting company stands, presenting your badge may enable them to retrieve the following personal data: first name(s), last name(s), address, telephone, fax, email, and professional activity information. For more information about this, please visit the ESMO Event Terms and Conditions page.</p>

<a name="eztoc21805_0_1_4_9" id="eztoc21805_0_1_4_9"></a><h4>Access to Personalised Services</h4><p>You do not need to register to access most of ESMO Web Site, but you do have to register to use personal services online and access certain web content.</p><p>The details you provide ESMO may be combined with information from other ESMO records to:</p>
<ul>

<li>provide you with online services like Abstract Submission, Registration for Congresses, etc.</li>

<li>save you having to keep giving the same information for different ESMO services</li>

<li>allow you to access specific web content reserved for ‘My ESMO’ users</li>

</ul>

<a name="eztoc21805_0_1_4_10" id="eztoc21805_0_1_4_10"></a><h4>Accessing your personal information</h4><p>You may at any time manage your personal information held by ESMO by accessing the ‘My ESMO’ area. If you are an ESMO Member, or have used ESMO products and services in the last three years, a record will already exist for you which you can potentially access by logging in online through:</p>
<ul>

<li>use of your existing login details (username and password)</li>

<li>the ‘Retrieve your Login’ feature which, if your email address is recognised, will automatically send details of your username and a newly generated password (for your protection) to the email address given</li>

</ul>
<p>Please note that ESMO does not permit more than one ‘My ESMO’ account per person to ensure accuracy in communication. So, if an account already exists for you in the ESMO system, your new account will be matched to it, within a reasonable timeframe, but longer during or after ESMO organised conference/meeting periods for technical reasons.</p><p>If you do happen to create a second account, then you should be aware that ESMO will merge your&nbsp; membership and other information regarding products and services used between your accounts, and your contact details held by ESMO will be replaced by the new ones you entered.</p>
