This information includes the Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), and clickstream data.

Our partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities in order to provide you with advertising that is based on your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you with interest-based ads, you may opt out. If you are in the United States, go to <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/</a>. If you are located in the European Union, go to <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>.

<p id="question3"><strong>With whom does Esri share my personal information?</strong></p>
<p>We use third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill customers for services, an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf, or technical service providers for customer support. When you sign up for our services, we will share your personal information only as necessary for the third party to provide that service. In addition, Esri may share your personal information within your organization, with third parties such as an Esri distributor, affiliate, or service provider within or outside the United States. Esri may also share or publish non-personal information, such as statistical data that provides information on how our users are using our software applications and services and how many people are visiting our websites. Our affiliates and vendors are also committed to protecting personal information as described in their privacy statements/policies. Under certain circumstances, we may remain liable for the acts of our third-party agents or service providers who perform services on our behalf for their handling of EU Personal Data that we transfer to them.</p>
<p>Esri will disclose your personal information when required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to legal requirements, such as to comply with a subpoena or valid national security or law enforcement requests, or prevent fraud or imminent harm or (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Esri.</p>



<p id="question4"><strong>Is my personal information secured?</strong></p>

If you have any questions about security on our website, you can visit <a href="http://trust.arcgis.com">http://trust.arcgis.com</a>, or you can report a problem at <a href="http://doc.arcgis.com/en/trust/security-concern/">http://doc.arcgis.com/en/trust/security-concern/</a>.
