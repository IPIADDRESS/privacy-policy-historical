				<h1>ESPN.com.au PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
                        <div>
                        
For over 25 years, ESPN has taken great pride in the relationships that it has developed with its fans. In keeping with this tradition, we at ESPN.com (“ESPN”) are dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal information we obtain from you with care and respect. This Privacy Policy is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies and principles.  <br> <br><h2>Sections</h2><br><ul><li><a href="#q1">What information does this Privacy Policy cover?</a>  </li><li><a href="#q2">What types of personally identifiable information do we collect about our fans?</a>  </li><li><a href="#q3">How is your personally identifiable information used and shared?</a>  </li><li><a href="#q4">What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information?</a>  </li><li><a href="#q5">What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?</a>  </li><li><a href="#q6">What kinds of additional privacy protections do we take for children under 13 and children between the ages of 13 and 17?</a>  </li><li><a href="#q7">How can you update your contact information?</a>  </li><li><a href="#q8">How will you know if we amend this Privacy Policy?</a>  </li></ul><br><br><br><h3><a name="q1"></a>Q1 What information does this Privacy Policy cover?</h3><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"> A1</span> Except as specifically described below in A2 and A7, this Privacy Policy applies only to personally identifiable information collected on the Web sites where this Privacy Policy is posted and does not apply to any other information collected by ESPN, Inc. or The Walt Disney Family of Companies through any other means, unless expressly set out otherwise in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>This Privacy Policy applies to use and sharing of personally identifiable information collected before, on, and after the date that this Privacy Policy is posted. We will also apply this Privacy Policy to personally identifiable information collected in the course of Non-Registered Transactions (as defined in A3) that occurred prior to the date that this Privacy Policy is posted, but only if the guest accepts the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. <br> <a href="http://www.espn.com.au/"><br>ESPN.com.au</a> (the "Web Site") is controlled and run by ESPN, Inc., part of The Walt Disney Family of Companies. As used in this Privacy Policy, "The Walt Disney Family of Companies" includes The Walt Disney Company and all of its subsidiaries and affiliated entities, as well as companies that generally offer their products and services under the “Disney” brand name, and are referred to in this Privacy Policy as "we,” "us," "our," and "ourselves."<br><br>In keeping with its mission and the sports tradition, ESPN refers to its visitors to its Web sites as fans.  When this Privacy Policy uses the term "personally identifiable information," we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual’s name, postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number. When other information, such as consumer product preferences or number of children, is directly associated with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy. Personally identifiable information is sometimes referred to in this Privacy Policy as “personal information.” Finally, the terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to all applicable laws.  <br><br><br><br><h3><a name="q2"></a>Q2 What types of personally identifiable information do we collect about our fans?</h3><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">A2</span> We collect several types of personally identifiable information about our fans. <br> <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Information You Provide to Us </span><br> <br>Much of the personally identifiable information we receive comes directly from fans who are interested in obtaining various products and services from us. Typically, this information includes the guest’s name, postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number. We may also collect other types of information such as gender, age, number of children, and personal interests, which we may associate with personally identifiable information. If you purchase products or services from us, we will note, for example, credit card information, the type of services or products ordered or purchased, and the date of the order or purchase. We collect personal information when you register on, log on, or visit our Web sites, including when you participate in activities on our Web sites, such as sweepstakes, contests, games and promotional offers. <br> <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Information Collected Through Technology </span><br> <br>We collect information through technology to make our sites more interesting and useful to you. For instance, when you come to one of our sites we collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone your IP address is not personally identifiable. We also may use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our fans visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information. <br> <br>Our Web sites also use cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web site. We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For instance, when you return to one of our sites after logging in, cookies provide information to the site so that the site will remember who you are. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won’t have access to many features that make your Web experience smoother (like the features mentioned above) and some of our services will not function properly.  <br> <br>Our Web sites use a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites. We also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Web sites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Web sites. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our fans to determine whether our fans have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable. <br> <br>Many advertisements are managed and placed on our Web sites by third parties. These companies are called “network advertisers.” Network advertisers who place advertisements on our Web sites may also use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information when you click on or move your cursor over one of their banner advertisements. You may not realize this information is being collected. In some cases, we may have access to information from Web beacons and cookies used by network advertisers on our sites and this information may permit us to identify other sites that you have visited that are also associated with the network advertiser. Finally, once you’ve clicked on an advertisement and have left our Web sites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their site. <br> <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Information That We Collect from Others </span><br> <br>We may supplement personally identifiable information that we have collected directly from our fans with other information that we obtain from third parties and other members of The Walt Disney Family of Companies. In addition, we may obtain information about individuals who are not yet users of our Web sites. In addition, when we associate information that we obtain from third parties or other members of The Walt Disney Family of Companies with personally identifiable information that we have collected under this Privacy Policy, we will treat the acquired information like the information that we collected ourselves and, except as permitted by this Privacy Policy, the information will not be shared with third parties.  <br> <br><br> <br><h3><a name="q3"></a>Q3 How is your personally identifiable information used and shared?</h3><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"> A3</span> As described below and subject to your choices as described in A4, The Walt Disney Family of Companies may use your personally identifiable information in many ways, including sending you promotional materials, and sharing your information with third parties so that these third parties can send you promotional materials. (By “promotional materials,” we mean communications that directly promote the use of our Web sites, or the purchase of products or services.)  <br> <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Disney Family of Companies, Licensees and Co-Branding Participants </span><br> <br>The Walt Disney Family of Companies may use your personal information for what are referred to as “Operational Uses.”) For example, we may use your information to complete transactions requested by you (such as your purchase of a product or service offered on our Web sites), or to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our Web sites, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy. As another example of Operational Uses, we may share your personal information with the Walt Disney World © Resort telephone reservations center so that the reservations center operators are able to respond immediately to your questions or requests when you call, rather than asking you to provide your information a second time. <br> <br>In addition to the Operational Uses, the Walt Disney Family of Companies may also use your personal information to send you promotional materials about goods and services (including special offers and promotions) either offered by The Walt Disney Family of Companies or offered by third parties. These promotional materials may be sent to you by postal mail, e-mail or other means. Please keep in mind, however, that when you purchase or request products or services from The Walt Disney Family of Companies, promotional materials may accompany delivery of that product or service. We refer to sending you promotional materials in these circumstances as “Fulfillment Uses” of your personal information. <br> <br>Subject to your choices under A4, in addition to using your personal information within The Walt Disney Family of Companies, The Walt Disney Family of Companies may share your personal information with companies that offer products and/or services under the ESPN brand or other brand names of The Walt Disney Family of Companies. These companies are called “licensees.” For example, a company that publishes and sells books under the “Disney” brand would be such a licensee. The Walt Disney Family of Companies may also share your information with companies that offer products and/or services that are co-branded using brand names of The Walt Disney Family of Companies. These companies are called “co-branding participants.” For example, an ESPN Visa card may be co-branded with the bank that issues that credit card. When The Walt Disney Family of Companies shares personal information with third parties acting as licensees and co-branding participants, these licensees and co-branding participants are restricted by contract from using the personal information for any marketing or promotional purpose that is not related to a licensed or co-branded product or service. <br> <br>You may engage in transactions (such as purchasing products or services) without registering and logging on our Web sites. These transactions may be either with us or with other members of The Walt Disney Family of Companies. (We refer to all of these transactions that you engage in without registering and logging on our Web sites as “Non-Registered Transactions.”) An example of a Non-Registered Transaction would be when you purchase items through a Disney e-commerce service without registering and logging on that Web site. When you engage in Non-Registered Transactions your information will not be shared with third parties and will not be used by any member of The Walt Disney Family of Companies to send you promotional materials other than the member involved in your transaction, except as separately permitted by other provisions of this Privacy Policy. <br> <br>Finally, The Walt Disney Family of Companies may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon the right of The Walt Disney Family of Companies to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and The Walt Disney Family of Companies may use and/or share with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information in any way. <br> <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Third Parties Offering Promotions, Products, or Services </span><br> <br>Subject to your choices under A4, The Walt Disney Family of Companies may share your personal information with selected third parties so that they can send you promotional materials about goods and services (including special offers and promotions) offered by them. (We call this type of sharing “promotional sharing” or sharing for “promotional purposes.”) When sharing your information for promotional purposes, The Walt Disney Family of Companies attempts to select only reputable companies that offer high quality products and services. Moreover, The Walt Disney Family of Companies will not share your e-mail address with third parties for promotional purposes, except when you consent to such sharing in the course of your participation in a Sponsored Activity as described below. When The Walt Disney Family of Companies shares your personal information with a third party under any circumstance described in this “Third Parties Offering Promotions, Products, or Services” section, your personal information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your personal information. <br> <br>In addition to the promotional sharing that is subject to your choices under A4, The Walt Disney Family of Companies may also share your information when you engage in certain activities on our sites that are sponsored by third parties, such as purchasing products or services offered by a third party, electing to receive information or communications from a third party, or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored in whole or in part by a third party. The Walt Disney Family of Companies may also share your personal information when you respond to promotional materials from The Walt Disney Family of Companies and authorize a third party to use your personal information for purposes such as, for example, sending you additional promotional materials, providing you a product or service, or entering you in a contest, sweepstakes or game. (We refer to all of these activities and requests as “Sponsored Activities.”) When you participate in Sponsored Activities, you will either be required or requested to agree that the sponsor or business associate may use your personal information (including, in some cases, your e-mail address) in accordance with the sponsor or business associate’s privacy practices.  <br> <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Companies That Facilitate Communications and Transactions with You </span><br> <br>Sometimes The Walt Disney Family of Companies hires companies to help deliver products or services, like a shipping company that delivers a package or a company that helps fulfill prizes for a sweepstakes. In those instances, there is a need to share your information with these companies. Sometimes The Walt Disney Family of Companies also works with other companies who help either gather your information or communicate with you. E xcept as separately permitted by other provisions of this Privacy Policy, these companies are allowed to gather, receive, and use your information only for the purposes described in this paragraph or as required by law. <br> <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Companies That You Previously Authorized to Obtain Your Information </span><br> <br>In certain circumstances, your dealings with a third party may have authorized that third party to obtain your personal information from The Walt Disney Family of Companies and to use that information in accordance with the third party’s own privacy practices and policies. For example, in using an online shopping service (such as the shopping services offered by Internet portals that refer the portal’s users to third-party merchants), you may have authorized that shopping service to obtain from the service’s participating third-party merchants (including The Walt Disney Family of Companies) information about your purchases conducted through the shopping service. The Walt Disney Family of Companies will provide such companies only the information that you authorized (except as separately permitted under other provisions of this Privacy Policy). In the example given above, the shopping service would be provided only information concerning purchases you made from The Walt Disney Family of Companies through that shopping service, and would not be provided any other information concerning you, unless any additional sharing of your personal information were separately permitted under another provision of this Privacy Policy. <br> <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Purchase or Sale of Businesses </span><br> <br>From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale. In the event that we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so. In the event that we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy). In light of this protection, nothing in this paragraph will affect our right to transfer your information to a purchaser in these circumstances. The provisions of this paragraph will also apply in the event that one or more businesses of any other member of The Walt Disney Family of Companies are sold and personal information subject to this Privacy Policy is transferred to a purchaser of those businesses. <br> <br>Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Web Sites, The Walt Disney Family of Companies and Others <br> <br>Regardless of any choices that you make under A4, you consent to The Walt Disney Family of Companies disclosing personal information when it believes in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and security of our Web sites, The Walt Disney Family of Companies, and/or third parties, including the safety and security of property that belongs to The Walt Disney Family of Companies or third parties. <br> <br><br><br><h3><a name="q4"></a>Q4 What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information?</h3><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"> A4</span> ESPN provides fans with the opportunity of deciding whether to receive unsolicited communications from ESPN and share personal information. This applies to information sent to Third Parties for promotions, products, and/or services unrelated to a specific transaction and information shared with the Walt Disney Family of Companies, licensees, co-branding participants, and others from time to time. You may make this decision when you first register on the Web Site and you may change your decision at any time by visiting <a href="http://registration.ESPN.com.au/">http://registration.ESPN.com.au</a>.<br><br>his decision to receive communications or share information will not apply to information used by the Disney family of companies for <br>Operational Uses), disclosures required by law, or disclosures to help protect the security and safety of our web sites.  <br> <br><br><br><h3><a name="q5"></a>Q5 What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?</h3><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">A5</span> The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect guest information from unauthorized access and improper use. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. <br> <br> <br><br><h3><a name="q6"></a>Q6 What kinds of additional privacy protections do we take for children under 13 and children between the ages of 13 and 17?</h3><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"> A6</span> Building on our general Privacy Policy, we recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections when children visit the sites. Below we explain how we do that for “kids.” Also, when we use the term “parent” below, we mean to include legal guardians.<br><br>Kids can surf <a href="http://ESPN.com.au/">ESPN.com.au</a> and other Walt Disney Company sites, view content, and play many games without any personal information being collected. We do not collect personal information from kids unless they register on ESPN or Walt Disney Company sites. Typically, kids will register in order to participate in sweepstakes or contests or to participate in a special activity. We collect the following information from kids during our registration process: the kid’s first and last name, the pronunciation for the kid’s name (in some jurisdictions), the kid’s email address, the parent’s email address, and the kid’s birth date, member name, password, address, and telephone number. We collect birth dates to validate the ages of our fans, including kids. We do not collect any other personally identifiable information from kids during our registration process.<br><br>If a kid is under 13 and registers with us, we will send an e-mail to the parent confirming the kid’s registration. No personal information collected from a kid under 13 will be used for any marketing or promotional purposes, either by ESPN or its affiliates. Moreover, for a kid under 13, no information should be submitted to or posted to ESPN or any Disney affiliate without consent of the parent.<br><br>If a kid is 13 to 17 years old and register s with us, we will send an e-mail to the parent confirming the kid’s registration. If a kid is 13 to 17 years old, we may, if a kid asks us, send the kid information or keep the kid informed about new activities on our web sites.<br><br>We may collect personal information from parents in order to allow kids to participate in certain features located on our Web sites and within our kids’ subscription products, such as Disney’s Toontown Online. These features may include instant message chatting (for example, Secret Friends in Disney’s Toontown Online), sending e-mail, posting on message boards, interacting with pen-pals, and other similar activities. In the course of a kid’s participation in these features, a kid may also provide us additional information about himself or herself, such as the contents of his or her chat or message board postings. If a parent allows us to collect personal information about their kid, we may link certain information collected through technology (see the “Information Collected Through Technology” section of A2) to that personal information.<br><br>If a kid wins a competition or sweepstakes, we may publish a winner’s first name, first initial of last name, city, and region of residence on our Web sites. Other procedures for competitions and sweepstakes are in the Terms of Use and in the rules for such competitions and sweepstakes, if any. <br> <br><br><br><h3><a name="q7"></a>Q7 How can you update your contact information and opt-in choices?</h3><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">A7</span> You can access and update the contact information you gave us during registration (that is, your postal address, e-mail address, or any other information that would directly enable us to contact you), or modify your opt- in choices, by going to our member services centers. Simply click on this link: <a href="http://ESPN.com.au/">http://ESPN.com.au</a> to log in with your member name and password to access and modify your preferences.<br><br>Parents can also use this process to refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their kid and can request that any personal information we have collected be deleted from our records. Parents can also access, change, or delete the personally identifiable information that we have collected from their kids. There are instructions on the start page of the link above to help you recover your password if you’ve forgotten it. If you need to recover your password, you can also request the hint to remember it or request a new password at <a href="http://registration.ESPN.com.au/">http://registration.ESPN.com.au</a>.<br><br>Finally, you may unsubscribe from certain e-mail communications by clicking on unsubscribe links in those e-mails.  <br>  <br> <br> <br><h3><a name="q8"></a>Q8 How will you know if we amend this Privacy Policy?  </h3> <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">A8</span> We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail at the last e-mail address that you provided us, and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on the Web sites covered by this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on the Web sites covered by this Privacy Policy.<br><br>Please note that, at all times, you are responsible for updating your personal information to provide us your current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any other reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice. In any event, changes to this Privacy Policy may affect our use of personal information that you provided us prior to our notification to you of the changes. If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your information, you must notify us prior to the effective date of the changes that you wish to deactivate your account with us.<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Posted: December 28, 2007 </span><br>
