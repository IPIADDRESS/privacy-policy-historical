			<h1>Escapia Information Policy</h1>

	</div>
	<p class="first">Escapia has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information-gathering and dissemination practices for this site. </p>
	<p>We use your Internet protocol (IP) address to help diagnose problems with our server, as well as to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. We may use your IP address to help protect ourselves and our partners from fraud. For system administration purposes, we also log IP server addresses and catalog traffic patterns through our site and our members' sites. However, we do not link this information to users' personal information. </p>
	<p>Our site uses cookies to identify your session only and to save your username so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. You have the option to accept or reject the cookie, and your choice will not affect your ability to access our site. The only difference in our site's features if you reject the cookie will be that you will have to re-enter your username each time you visit our site. Our site's cookies are not linked to any personally identifiable information. </p>
	<p>The membership form and the rental application form require users to provide us with contact information (such as their name and e-mail address), financial information (such as their bank account or credit card numbers) and demographic information (such as their zip code). We use customer contact information from both forms to send the user information about our company, as well as to contact the user when necessary (such as when a customer attempts payment with an expired credit card). Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the section entitled "Choice/Opt-Out" below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services, as well as to verify the user's identity and to prevent fraud. </p>
	<p>This site may contain links to other sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are 'clicking' to another Web site. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their privacy policies may differ from ours. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. </p>
	<p>We collect demographic and profile data at our site. This data is used to compile usage statistics and other data regarding the use of the Escapia service. We share with our customers and partners aggregated statistical data that includes users' demographic information but does not identify them. This statistical data helps us and our participating customers to profile resident categories and to develop rental products that have appeal in the marketplace. We reserve the right to sell and provide any and all such aggregated and non-individually identifiable data to third parties. </p>
	<p>If a visitor chooses to apply for an apartment, we share the visitor's submitted information with our customers (property owners and managers) who use the submitted information to process the apartment application, to evaluate the user's eligibility and to process the rental transaction. These customers may have their own privacy policies that apply to the handling of users' personal information received from visitor applications. Property owners and managers are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that pertain to their rental practices. Although we contractually require them not to disclose confidential consumer information to others, we have no direct control over their information-handling practices. </p>
	<p>Escapia offers features and services on our site where, by necessity, we will need to provide some of the information publicly available on our members' sites to third-party search engines offering search services. Escapia may do the following with such information: distribute member product and service information as well as information about the site, the user's Web site address (URL), the user's contact information and other information to such search engines and various other comparative shopping and search services, and create a database of publicly available information about users or their businesses to its search partners with the express purpose of driving Internet user traffic to member sites, provided that such information is useful to the end users of the member sites. Publicly available information means information available to the public on a user's Web site, and may include the following: information about the products or services offered through the member site, the user's business address, operating hours and business contact information, the user's URL and other such information. In no event, however, will Escapia disclose any user's financial information. </p>
	<p>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Escapia employs Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology to transmit sensitive credit card data between a user's browser and the Escapia Web server. To use our Web site, a user will need an SSL-capable browser such as MS Internet Explorer 3.0 (or higher) or Netscape Navigator 2.0 (or higher). Our database and our Web server operate separately from each other, and each is protected by an electronic and physical firewall keeping users' data secure. </p>
	<p><strong>Choice/Opt-Out</strong><br>
	Users should send an e-mail to accounts@escapia.com if they would like to change or remove their information from our database and halt future communications. When writing, please supply your instructions, your username used to sign up, and the URL of the site to which you originally provided your information. </p>
	<p><strong>Contacting the Web Site</strong><br>
	If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of our Web site or your dealings with our Web site, you can contact:</p>
