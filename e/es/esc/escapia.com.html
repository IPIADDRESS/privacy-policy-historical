Escapia has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our
firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the
information-gathering and dissemination practices for this site.
</p>

<p>
We use your Internet protocol (IP) address to help diagnose
problems with our server, as well as to administer our Web site. Your IP
address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic
information. We may use your IP address to help protect ourselves and our
partners from fraud. For system administration purposes, we also log IP
server addresses and catalog traffic patterns through our site and our
members' sites. However, we do not link this information to users'
personal information.
</p>

<p>
Our site uses cookies to identify your session only and to
save your username so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit
our site. You have the option to accept or reject the cookie, and your
choice will not affect your ability to access our site. The only
difference in our site's features if you reject the cookie will be that
you will have to re-enter your username each time you visit our site. Our
site's cookies are not linked to any personally identifiable information.
</p>

<p>
The membership form and the rental application form require
users to provide us with contact information (such as their name and
e-mail address), financial information (such as their bank account or
credit card numbers) and demographic information (such as their zip code).
We use customer contact information from both forms to send the user
information about our company, as well as to contact the user when
necessary (such as when a customer attempts payment with an expired credit
card). Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the section
entitled "Choice/Opt-Out" below. Financial information that is collected
is used to bill the user for products and services, as well as to verify
the user's identity and to prevent fraud.
</p>

<p>
This site may contain links to other sites. Please note that
when you click on one of these links, you are 'clicking' to another Web
site. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked
sites as their privacy policies may differ from ours. We are not
responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
</p>

<p>
We collect demographic and profile data at our site. This
data is used to compile usage statistics and other data regarding the use
of the Escapia service. We share with our customers and partners
aggregated statistical data that includes users' demographic information
but does not identify them. This statistical data helps us and our
participating customers to profile resident categories and to develop
rental products that have appeal in the marketplace. We reserve the right
to sell and provide any and all such aggregated and non-individually
identifiable data to third parties.
</p>

<p>
If a visitor chooses to apply for an apartment, we share the
visitor's submitted information with our customers (property owners and
managers) who use the submitted information to process the apartment
application, to evaluate the user's eligibility and to process the rental
transaction. These customers may have their own privacy policies that
apply to the handling of users' personal information received from visitor
applications. Property owners and managers are subject to federal and
state laws and regulations that pertain to their rental practices.
Although we contractually require them not to disclose confidential
consumer information to others, we have no direct control over their
information-handling practices.
</p>

<p>
Escapia offers features and services on our site where, by
necessity, we will need to provide some of the information publicly
available on our members' sites to third-party search engines offering
search services. Escapia may do the following with such information:
distribute member product and service information as well as information
about the site, the user's Web site address (URL), the user's contact
information and other information to such search engines and various other
comparative shopping and search services, and create a database of
publicly available information about users or their businesses to its
search partners with the express purpose of driving Internet user traffic
to member sites, provided that such information is useful to the end users
of the member sites. Publicly available information means information
available to the public on a user's Web site, and may include the
following: information about the products or services offered through the
member site, the user's business address, operating hours and business
contact information, the user's URL and other such information. In no
event, however, will Escapia disclose any user's financial information.
</p>

<p>
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss,
misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Escapia
employs Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology to transmit
sensitive credit card data between a user's browser and the Escapia Web
server. To use our Web site, a user will need an SSL-capable browser such
as MS Internet Explorer 3.0 (or higher) or Netscape Navigator 2.0 (or
higher). Our database and our Web server operate separately from each
other, and each is protected by an electronic and physical firewall
keeping users' data secure.
</p>

<p>
<b>Choice/Opt-Out</b><br>
Users should send an e-mail to accounts@escapia.com if they would like to change or remove
their information from our database and halt future communications.
When writing, please supply your instructions, your username used to sign
up, and the URL of the site to which you originally provided your information.
