Customer Data</h2><p>Our Service provides a technology that is installed in third-party mobile applications (“apps”) belonging to our Customers, and which provides our Customers with real-time analytics and tools to create a better experience for their end users. When a Customer uses our Service, the Customer’s app may collect personal information from end users (“Customer Data”) that is shared with Estimote. This Customer Data is owned and controlled by our customers, and any Customer Data that we maintain or process we consider to be strictly confidential. We collect and process Customer Data solely on behalf of our customers, and in accordance with our agreements with the customers. We do not use or disclose Customer Data except as authorized and required by our customers and provided for in our agreements with our customers.</p><p>In this Section, we describe the type of data that is collected through our Customers’ apps and shared with Estimote. Apps that use Estimote may use only some of the features and information that Estimote can collect. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to the data collection and use practices ofEstimote’s website, and does not apply to Customer Data or to the data collection practices of our third party Customers that use our Service. It is always a good idea to carefully read the privacy policy of each mobile app you install and use on your mobile device to be sure you understand the app’s data collection and use practices.</p><p><b>Data Collected through the Service.</b> Through the course of providing our Service to our Customers, our Customers’ apps will collect information from an end user’s device any time the end user’s app comes within range of an Estimote beacon (a small device that uses Bluetooth technology to identify Estimote- enabled Customer apps and may be placed in retail stores or other Customer locations). Estimote relies on an app-specific identifier that is used to identify a unique app user. This identifier is associated only with the specific Customer app and is not tied to your mobile device. If you delete the Customer app from your device, this identifier will be deleted as well. Relying on this app-specific ID, we collect your location (latitude/longitude coordinates) and the time of day and your location when your device is near any of our beacons. We also collect device information, such as the device type, model and operating system version, and current IP address. We use this information to identify when you enter or leave the range of a particular beacon in a Customer’s retail store or location where they have placed a Beacon in order to provide analytic tools to help our Customers better serve and understand their end users. We never collect personally identifying information such as a name, mobile phone number, email address, or other contact information from our Customer’s end users. If you do not want the Estimote beacon to identify your mobile device, you can: (a) delete the Customer app or adjust the in-app settings of the Customer app if the app makes that option available, or (b) turn “off” your Bluetooth through your device’s Settings feature.</p><h2 class="u-mb-">4.
