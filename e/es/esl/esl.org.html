    <td align="left" valign="top" width="536">At ESL, we know 
      that trust is the foundation of our members’ relationship with us. We 
      understand the need and desire of our members to have information 
      regarding their personal finances kept confidential. Therefore, ESL has 
      always had a strict policy regarding the protection of our members’ 
      information. This policy, explained below, details how we use information 
      from and regarding you (our member), how we keep it private, and when 
      information can or must be shared by ESL.
      <ol>
        <li>ESL and its employees will, within strict guidelines, safeguard any 
        information you share with us. Access to your information by employees 
        will be reasonably limited to those employees that have a business 
        reason for such access. Employees that do not follow these guidelines 
        will be subject to our normal disciplinary procedures. 
        </li><li>We will collect, retain and use information about you only where we 
        believe it necessary or useful in order to operate our business and to 
        make available products, services, and other opportunities to you. 
        </li><li>We will share information regarding you with third parties only 
        when, in our judgment, either (a) you have authorized the sharing of 
        information, (b) we have previously informed you in disclosures that we 
        will share information, (c) we are compelled by law or valid court order 
        to do so, or (d) we have entered into an agreement with a third party 
        for support services (in which case the third party will also agree to 
        maintain the confidentiality of our members’ information). 
        </li><li>ESL does not share or sell marketing lists to third parties. ESL may 
        share information with its subsidiaries and affiliates within the limits 
        of applicable law. 
        </li><li>We will attempt to keep all member information up-to-date wherever 
        feasible. Please inform us immediately if any information about you is 
        inaccurate. 
        </li><li>Any information provided to ESL or its affiliates through our Web 
        sites will be maintained according to the above privacy principles. 
        </li><li>In order to provide better service or to address security hazards,
