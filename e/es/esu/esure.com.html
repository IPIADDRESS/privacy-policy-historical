We will send you marketing about similar products and services by post, telephone, email, SMS and through digital channels. Digital channels includes social media and similar such digital marketing channels. We may upload and match the personal data you provide to us with the data you provide to social media and similar such digital marketing channels. This allows us to improve our knowledge of you and, in return, serve you with relevant marketing messages.<br><br>
You can object to receiving marketing from us at any time. Please provide your details via the following online form: <a href="/unsubscribe">www.esure.com/unsubscribe</a>; follow the unsubscribe link in our marketing emails or SMS; or send us your name, address and date of birth via email to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@esure.com">unsubscribe@esure.com</a> or by post to: Data Protection Officer, esure, The Observatory, Reigate, RH2 0SG.<br><br>
We consider that it is within our legitimate interests to send you information about our products and services for marketing purposes.</p>

<details open=""><summary>Automated decisions and profiling</summary><p class="details-wrapper"><br>
We use the personal data you provide to us, information about you provided by third parties (please see “How we collect information about you” for further details), and aggregated data of other individuals who match your risk profile, to enable us to evaluate and predict your behaviour when asking for a quote or processing a claim.</p>

<p class="details-wrapper">We use algorithms to check any claims, fraud, credit history, data about your local area and the vehicle or home you wish to have insured; and whether your conduct accessing our products or services suggests a risk of fraud. You may automatically be considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk if our processing of your personal data reveals your behaviour to be consistent with that of known fraudsters or money launderers; or inconsistent with your previous submissions; or you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity. This activity is essential to allow us to decide whether to offer you a quote, the appropriate insurance premium to offer you, and whether there is a risk of fraud. These decisions may be made by entirely automated means (that is, without human intervention) and through profiling. As with all insurers, where we are taking on more risk in terms of the likelihood of damage to your vehicle or home and the cost of fixing, replacing it or dealing with third party claims and/or there is a higher risk of our being defrauded, we will charge a higher insurance premium, and in some circumstances may refuse to offer a quote or continue to provide services.</p>

<p class="details-wrapper">We consider that, to the extent our decisions based solely on automated processing produce legal or similarly significant effects for you, those decisions are necessary for entering into, or performance of, our contract of insurance with you. However, you have the right to contact us to express your point of view (including providing any additional information that you want us to consider) and to contest such decisions. A member of our team will then re-consider it. If you wish to exercise these rights, please contact us by emailing: <a href="mailto:dpo@esure.com">dpo@esure.com</a> or by post: Data Protection Officer, esure, The Observatory, Reigate, RH2 0SG.</p>

<details open=""><summary>Consequences of processing</summary><p class="details-wrapper"><br>
If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a risk of fraud or money laundering, we may refuse to provide the products, services and financing you have requested. We may also stop providing existing services to you. A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by us and the fraud prevention agencies. It may also result in others refusing to provide products, services, financing or employment to you. If you have any questions about our processing of your data for fraud purposes, please contact our Data Protection Officer at the details provided above.</p>
