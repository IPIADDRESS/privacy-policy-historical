		<b>What information do we collect?</b><br>
		When you join esnipe, we ask for some information that will identify you to us as
		a user. This information includes your name, email address, eBay username and
		eBay password. We require your eBay username and password in order to place bids
		on your behalf. Without these, esnipe could not place a bid on eBay for you.
		We also ask you to supply a handful of demographic statistics. This is for
		aggregate purposes only. It is not stored with your other information, and can
		not ever be associated with you or your account - even by esnipe.<p></p>
		We also collect statistical data about the bids being placed by the esnipe
		servers. This information is also aggregrate, and is not associated with
		you or your account.		
		<p></p>
		
		<b>What do you do with this information?</b><br>
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">
		esnipe <b>never</b> supplies your personal information to any third party. We will
		occasionally use your email address to send you information regarding esnipe and
		the services we provide. The demographic information we collect is supplied to
		our advertisers in a summarized form, and never contains any member information.
		Your eBay username and password are stored securely in our database, and can only
		be changed by yourself once you have logged into the system. This username and
		password is transmitted to eBay when esnipe places a bid on your behalf.<p></p>
		The information we collect about bids is summarized, and we provide basic
		information to our advertisers on the general product categories our
		members are interested in. Again - your personal information is never
		provided to any third party.<p></p>
		esnipe works with a third party that serves ads to this site. To find out more about
		how Engage Media manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads
		on this site, please go to <a href="http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html">http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html</a>. 		
		<p></p>
		
		<b>Is my information secure?</b><br>
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">
		Your personal information is protected by your password. Never share this
		password with anyone. esnipe will never contact you unsolicited to ask
		for your password. We have taken steps to ensure our databases are secure,
		and are confident in our ability to keep your information safe. However,
		please note that the bid pages on eBay are not encrypted, and therefore
		when esnipe, or yourself for that matter, places a bid - your username
		and password is sent over the Internet without encryption. Because of
		this, esnipe can not guarantee 100% protection of your password when
		a bid is being placed.
		<p></p>

		<b>What about cookies?</b><br>
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">
		esnipe stores a cookie on your computer to track you while you are on
		the site.  The information in this cookie is a string of characters
		that is meaningless to everyone and everything except our server. No
		personal information or bid information is stored in the cookie. The
		information in the cookie can not be used by another individual to
		gain access to your account information.

		<b>Still have questions?</b><br>
