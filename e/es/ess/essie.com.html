						&nbsp;<br>
							<em>Last updated: January 13, 2010</em>
						    <p>
							Essie.com knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. <strong>By visiting essie.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							What personal information about customers does essie.com gather?<br>
							The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at essie.com. Here are the types of information we gather.
							How secure is information about me?
							</p><ul>
								<li><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> We receive and store any information you enter on our web site or give us in any other way. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, improving our site and communicating with you.</li>
								<li><strong>Automatic Information:</strong> We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses essie.com. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at essie.com, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.</li>
							</ul>
						<p></p>
						<p>
							<strong>What about cookies?</strong><br>
							Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser
							The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of essie.com's coolest features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Does essie.com share the information it receives?</strong><br>
							Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries essie.com controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
							</p><ul>
								<li>Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</li>
								<li>Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that essie.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</li>
								<li>Protection of essie.com and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of essie.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.</li>
								<li>With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</li>
							</ul>
						<p></p>
						<p>
							How secure is information about me?
							</p><ul>
								<li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.</li>
								<li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.</li>
							</ul>
						<p></p>
						<p>
							<strong>What choices do I have?</strong><br>
							The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Conditions of use, notices, and revisions</strong><br>
							If you choose to visit essie.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of New York. If you have any concern about privacy at essie.com, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.
							Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also. You should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Information you give us</strong><br>
							You provide most such information when you search, buy, post, participate in a contest or questionnaire, or communicate with customer service. For example, you provide information when you search for a product; or communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form.
