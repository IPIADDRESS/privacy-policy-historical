<br>&nbsp;

<p><b><font size="-1">&nbsp;Date revised and posted: 04/99</font></b></p></center>



<p><b><font size="-1">Essence Communications, Inc.'s Web Site Privacy Policy

has been developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the finest

quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing

with our customers.&nbsp; The Policy guides how we collect, store and use

information about customers and prospects, and it will be continuously

assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers’

changing needs.</font></b>

</p><p><b><font size="-1">Our Policy recognizes two kinds of personal data that

deserve different levels of protection.&nbsp; Personally-Identifiable Information

includes, for example, e-mail addresses, billing information, employment

status and “click stream” data that tracks visitor activity on a Web site

or online service.&nbsp; A subset of that category, Sensitive Data, deserves

additional safeguards.&nbsp; Sensitive Data includes, by way of example,

Social Security numbers, mothers’ maiden names, personal financial data

(such as specific salary, portfolio or net worth information), information

about specific medical conditions and most information about children.&nbsp;

Our business units collect Personally-Identifiable Information and Sensitive

Data only when there is a legitimate business reason to do so.</font></b>

</p><p><b><font size="-1">Our Policy provides the following:</font></b>

</p><p><b><u><font size="-1">Notice:</font></u></b><b><font size="-1"></font></b>

</p><p><b><font size="-1">Our Website does not automatically collect any individually

identifiable information from visitors.&nbsp; We collect the e-mail addresses

of those who communicate with us via e-mail and any information volunteered

by the customer, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

This information is used by our editors to better understand our subscribers

and by our advertisers to target their advertisements. It is not required

for magazine fulfillment and should be submitted at the subscriber's discretion.</font></b>

</p><p><b><font size="-1">We need to collect and store your name, address, and

other basic Personally-Identifiable Information, for example, to fulfill

your subscription or to provide other products or services you requested,

as well as for billing purposes.&nbsp; This information also enables us

to develop and customize products to better meet your needs and preferences

and to offer you products from Essence Communications, Inc. and other sources

that may be of interest to you.</font></b>

</p><p><b><font size="-1">From time to time, we are approached by companies and

organizations that have a product or service that we believe may be of

interest to you.&nbsp; We may share your Personally-Identifiable Information

with these companies in an effort to help you find these resources.&nbsp;

We do not expect to receive any consideration from those companies or organizations

for providing this information; however, we reserve the right to do so.</font></b>

</p><p><b><font size="-1">If your relationship with us includes providing us

with Sensitive Data, we will protect that information with extra care.

We will not distribute Sensitive Data outside of Essence Communications,

Inc.

<br><br>

We contract with DoubleClick to sell and manage the advertisements that you see on the site.  DoubleClick makes available both its policies and information practices at 

<a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/">www.doubleclick.net </a> and has voluntarily opened its practices and systems for third party auditing. <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/nf/general/onpriset.htm">Click here</a> to read their privacy statement or email them at mailto:info@doubleclick.net if you have any additional questions.

</font></b>

</p><p><b><u><font size="-1">Security:</font></u></b>

<br><b><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></b>

<br><b><font size="-1">We will maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure

the security, integrity and privacy of your Personally-Identifiable Information.</font></b>

</p><p><b><u><font size="-1">Review and Correction:</font></u></b><b><font size="-1"></font></b>

</p><p><b><font size="-1">We are continuing to enhance our procedures to enable

you to review and correct, upon request, the Personally-Identifiable Information

we collect from you.&nbsp; Currently, most of our units require that you

make such a request in a manner that can be verified.</font></b>

</p><p><b><u><font size="-1">Questions or comments?:</font></u></b><b><font size="-1"></font></b>

</p><p><b><font size="-1">The Essence Communications, Inc. Web Site Privacy Policy

has been developed out of respect for the privacy preferences and choices

of our customers and prospects.&nbsp; We have established procedures to

ensure that every reasonable effort is made to address your concerns.&nbsp;
