<br>
<b></b><ol><b></b><li><b>Overview</b><br>
E-Sports Entertainment, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, "ESEA" or "we" or "our") respect your privacy. This privacy policy (this "Policy") informs you of our privacy practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected online and how that information is used.<br>
<br>
This Policy applies to all websites, servers and services owned or provided by ESEA (collectively, "ESEA Sites"). ESEA may add new sites, domain names or services from time to time. As explained below, this Policy applies only to websites owned and services maintained by ESEA and not to websites or services to which links may be provided on ESEA Sites.<br>
<br>
BY USING THIS SITE, OR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE OFFERED ON THIS SITE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY.<br>
<br>
ESEA Sites may provide links to independent websites for your convenience and information. If you access these links, you will leave our site. ESEA does not control these independent sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from this Policy. ESEA does not endorse or make any representations about any independent websites. The personal data you choose to provide to, or that is collected directly by, these independent sites is not covered by this Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of each and every website you visit on the Internet before submitting your personal information.</li>
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Children Under 13</b><br>
ESEA Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13.

This requirement will be posted at points of data collection within ESEA Sites, such as registration for services.<br>
<br>
We encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. We also urge parents and guardians to instruct their children never to give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers without parental permission when using the Internet. If any parent or guardian has any concern about any ESEA Site or their respective services, or wish to cancel your child's registration, please contact us at the address set forth below.</li>
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Collection of Personal Information</b><br>

In certain instances, you may also submit similar information about other people (such as when shipping products purchased on ESEA Sites).</li>
<br>
<li><u>Automatic Data Collection Tools.</u>  In addition to the information you provide us, ESEA may also collect information during your visit to any ESEA Site through the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, which may include cookies, web beacons and other commonly used information-gathering tools. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website such as your browser type and language and access times. These tools may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address, clickstream behavior (i.e., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take in connection with ESEA Sites) and products and services you use. ESEA may also use some of these Automatic Data Collection Tools in connection with certain emails sent from ESEA and therefore may collect information using these tools when you open the email or click on a link contained in the email. Automatic Data Collection Tools are discussed further below.</li>
<br>
<li><u>Commingled Information.</u>  ESEA may also collect information from commercially available sources that it deems credible. Such information may include your name, address, email address and demographic data. The information ESEA collects from its commercial sources may be used along with the information ESEA collects when you visit ESEA Sites. For example, ESEA may compare the geographic information acquired from commercial sources with the IP address collected by Automatic Data Collection Tools to derive your general geographic area.</li>
<br>
<li><u>Community Tools.</u>  From time to time, ESEA may make message boards, chat rooms, forums, news groups and other community tools available to you on ESEA Sites.
