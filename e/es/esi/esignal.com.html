you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to be legally bound 
by it.<br>
In addition, if you register as a user of any of the features of our Website (a 
“Subscriber”), during the registration process (and from time to time 
as eSignal may require) you will be prompted to click an “I Accept,” 
“Submit” or similar button, which further confirms your agreement 
to be legally bound by this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<font color="006699"><a name="2x" id="2x"></a>2.0 Scope of Policy</font><br>
This Privacy Policy applies only to information you provide to us online or that 
we collect from you while visiting or using our Website. It does not apply to 
information we have obtained offline or through other means. <br>
<br>
<font color="006699"><a name="3x" id="3x"></a>3.0 What Information We Collect 
and Use</font> <br>
eSignal reserves the right to use and control the information collected on the 
Website. We will not share this information with any third party, other than as 
disclosed in this Privacy Policy. eSignal collects information from users at different 
points on our Website and through our software, as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
<p> 3.1. Registration: In order to subscribe to eSignal products and services, 
we require that you complete a registration form. This form may ask for contact 
information, such as name, address, email address, telephone number, company name, 
fax number and other basic contact information (“Registration Information”). 
After submitting your Registration Information, you can view and modify this information 
within the self-maintenance area of the Website. You agree to notify eSignal of 
any change to your billing address within thirty (30) days of such change. eSignal 
will record the date and time that your Registration Information is created or 
modified by you.</p>
<p>3.2. Order: When you subscribe to an eSignal product or service, we request 
the appropriate billing information on our order form. This information includes 
your credit card number, expiration date and billing address (“Order Information”). 
Order Information is kept with your Registration Information in a database and 
will be retained for future purchases.</p>
<p>3.3. eSignal Software: While accessing and operating an eSignal product, the 
eSignal software will record general statistical and tracking information, such 
as the date and time a client accesses his or her product and the time spent using 
it. The eSignal software transfers this information to eSignal’s servers, 
and such information is used exclusively for internal resource management purposes.</p>
<p>3.4. Other: eSignal may automatically receive and record information in our 
server logs from your browser, including your IP address (the Internet address 
of your PC), your computer’s name, the type and version of your web browser, 
referrer addresses and other generally-accepted log information. We may also record 
page views (hit counts) and other general statistical and tracking information, 
which will be aggregated with that of other users in order to understand how our 
Website is being used.</p>
<p>3.5. Cookies: What is a cookie? A cookie is a small amount of data, which often 
includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a 
website’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies 
can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience and to make it easier 
for you to use the Website upon a future visit. eSignal will also use cookies 
to recognize you when you return to our Website. Most web browsers are set to 
accept cookies by default, though you can manually disable the cookies feature 
of your browser. You should review the online documentation of your browser or 
consult with the provider of your browser for instructions on how to disable cookies. 
Please note that if you disable cookies on your computer, some parts of this Website 
may not function properly.</p>
<p>3.6. Referrers: A “referrer” is the information passed along by 
a web browser that references the web URL you linked from and is automatically 
collected by our web server. This information is collected and used by eSignal 
to understand the websites referring traffic to our Website and to present appropriate 
content to our potential customers. eSignal tabulates referrer information on 
an aggregate basis to identify trends and traffic patterns.</p>
<p>3.7. Partners: eSignal may enter into agreements with other companies that 
market software or services that either function similarly to eSignal software 
or that enhance or extend eSignal’s functionality. Some of these may be 
third party products that may utilize components of eSignal software. Under the 
terms of these agreements, we may be required to collect information about your 
sessions and your use of these third party products and share this information 
with these third parties.</p>
<p>3.8. Providers: A provider is an entity that agrees to pay for the eSignal 
services being provided to you. We have entered into contractual agreements with 
these providers governing the provider arrangement. Under the terms of these agreements, 
we may be required to collect information about your sessions and your use of 
your eSignal product and share this information, along with your personally identifiable 
information, with the provider paying for your eSignal service. This information 
is kept strictly confidential, and is not shared with other third parties, except 
as provided for in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>3.9. Computer Configuration: In order to determine whether your computer is 
supported by our system, we may collect certain anonymous information. This information 
includes, but may not be limited to, your operating system and browser, as well 
as the presence of the eSignal software or other third party software on your 
computer. This information is kept strictly confidential and is not shared with 
third parties, except as provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><font color="006699"><a name="4x" id="4x"></a>4.0 What We Do with Information 
We Collect and Use</font> <br>
In general, except as provided in this policy, we will not disclose your personally 
identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties without your express consent. 
There are, however, some limited circumstances in which we may need to disclose 
personally identifiable information about a user without express consent, including, 
but not limited to, the circumstances set forth below:</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>4.1. eSignal Website Vendors: We may employ other companies to perform functions 
on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, providing customer service, sending 
print and electronic mail, processing credit card payments, or other functions 
necessary to our business. In order to allow these companies to perform their 
obligations, we may need to share your personally identifiable information with 
them. However, we will provide these companies with only that information necessary 
to perform their functions on our behalf, and we will not allow them to use your 
personally identifiable information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>4.2. Resellers: eSignal may from time to time enter into agreements with companies 
that resell eSignal’s products or services, either on eSignal’s behalf, 
or on their own behalf on a private labeled basis and/or on a co-branded basis. 
Under the terms of these agreements, we may be required, and therefore we reserve 
the right, to share your personally identifiable information with such resellers. 
Once your personally identifiable information is provided to such resellers, it 
will no longer be covered by this privacy policy. In those instances, your personally 
identifiable information will be governed by the privacy policy of the resellers 
to whom it is provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, eSignal will not share 
your Order Information with any reseller that is not billing you directly for 
the re-marketed, private labeled and/or co-branded eSignal services to which you 
subscribe. </p>
<p>4.3. eSignal Publishers and Merchants: eSignal reserves the right to provide 
to publishers and other merchants for whom eSignal sells or distributes products 
or services any personally identifiable information as is necessary to fulfill 
any requests you may make for their products or services. In addition, merchants 
of the products you purchase or to which you subscribe through eSignal may request 
additional personally identifiable information from you. eSignal will provide 
the merchants of such products the information you supply in response to those 
requests and, following such disclosure by eSignal, your personally identifiable 
information will no longer be covered by this policy. In those instances, your 
personally identifiable information is governed by the privacy policy of the merchants 
whose products you have purchased or to which you have subscribed.</p>
<p>4.4. Imminent Harm: We may reveal your personally identifiable information 
to attorneys, private investigator organizations or law enforcement agencies if 
we believe that you are harming or interfering (or will imminently harm or interfere) 
with other eSignal users or anyone else or violating (either intentionally or 
unintentionally) our Website Terms and Conditions of Use or infringing any of 
eSignal’s legal rights.</p>
<p>4.5. Legal: eSignal will reveal your personally identifiable information, to 
the extent we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law. If we receive 
legal process calling for the disclosure of any of your personally identifiable 
information we will attempt to notify you via the email address you supplied during 
registration within a reasonable amount of time before we respond to the request, 
unless such notification is not permitted.</p>
<p>4.6. Transfer of Website: eSignal shall be entitled to transfer to a third 
party information it collects, including any personally identifiable information, 
in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of its assets. </p>

<p><font color="006699"><a name="5x" id="5x"></a>5.0 Changing or Removing Personal 
Information; Opting Out </font><br>
To ensure that you have appropriate control over your personally identifiable 
information, you can access your account (after supplying your user name and password) 
in the Self-Maintenance area of our Website to update and/or correct the information 
you have previously submitted. <br>
In addition, we provide you with the ability to decline -- or “opt-out of” 
-- certain mailings and other materials we may offer. For these materials, you 
will be able to specify whether you wish to opt-out by following directions provided 
in the Self-Maintenance area, as further detailed in Section 6.0 (Communications 
to out Users) of our Privacy Policy, below. <br>
Finally, if you request, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable 
information from our databases. Please understand, however, that it may be impossible 
to remove this information completely, due to backups and records of deletions. 
If you wish to remove your name and other personally identifiable information 
from our database, please create an email with the term “Unsubscribe” 
in the subject line, and send the email to the address listed in Section 12.0 
of this Privacy Policy. As an alternative, you may write to us with your request, 
at the mailing address set forth in Section 12.0. You will be removed from our 
databases generally within ten business days of our receipt of your request. <br>
<br>
<br>
<font color="006699"><a name="6x" id="6x"></a>6.0 Communications to our Users</font></p>
<blockquote> 
<p>6.1. eSignal: eSignal sends emails and/or postal mailings to new subscribers 
and to provide to existing subscribers information regarding their specific eSignal 
products. Periodically, eSignal will send news and information to subscribers 
and other parties who have expressed interest in eSignal and its products. These 
communications are an information service to users who have indicated a preference 
to receive promotions relating to eSignal’s products, Website and services, 
and to receive special offers relating to third-party products, sites and services. 
You can opt out of receiving these promotional communications through the Self-Maintenance 
area of our Website. For so long as you use eSignal products and services or otherwise 
maintain a business relationship with eSignal, however, you may not opt out of 
receiving communications from eSignal relating specifically to those products 
and services or business relationship.</p>
<p>6.2. Third Parties: Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share 
personally identifiable information with anyone, unless we have informed you of 
a change to our Privacy Policy and given you the opportunity to then choose to 
opt out. Once you have indicated that your information may be shared with third 
parties or you have responded to an offer by any third party on the Website, eSignal 
can no longer update any of your personally identifiable information that has 
been transferred to such third parties or opt you out of such third parties so 
that you no longer receive their promotional and/or marketing information. Instead, 
you must either contact that third party or refer to its privacy policy to update 
your personally identifiable information or to let the third party know that you 
no longer want to receive promotional and/or marketing information about its products, 
services or offerings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="006699"><a name="7x" id="7x"></a>7.0 Security of Personally Identifiable 
Information </font><br>
eSignal maintains controls to protect the financial information you provide us, 
including credit card details, during the product purchase process. These controls 
include: (1) the use of SSL encryption to safeguard information when transmitted 
from your web browser to eSignal; (2) the logical authentication security within 
the databases that store customers’ credit card numbers; and (3) use of 
encryption of credit card numbers. <br>
eSignal employees are required to acknowledge that they understand and will strictly 
abide by our corporate policies with respect to the confidentiality of personally 
identifiable information. Moreover, eSignal only gives access to databases containing 
personally identifiable information to employees on a need-to-know basis. Internal 
policies require that passwords be changed regularly, pursuant to security protocols. 
Our security procedures are reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that they remain 
current.<br>
Accordingly, we have put in place security systems designed to prevent unauthorized 
disclosure of information you provide to us. These systems are structured to deter 
and prevent hackers and others from accessing this information. Due to the nature 
of Internet communications and evolving technologies, however, we cannot provide, 
and disclaim, assurance that the information you provide us will remain free from 
loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain 
unauthorized access.<br>
<br>
<font color="006699"><a name="8x" id="8x"></a>8.0 Children</font> <br>
Persons under the age of eighteen (18) are not permitted to register for the eSignal 
service and eSignal does not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personally 
identifiable information from persons under the age of eighteen (18). If we learn 
that a child under (18) has provided us with personally identifiable information, 
we will delete this information from our databases, subject to any technical limitations 
on our ability to do so.<br>
<br>
<font color="006699"><a name="9x" id="9x"></a>9.0 Notification of Changes</font> 
<br>
eSignal reserves the right to change or modify this Privacy Policy from time to 
time, or to terminate this Privacy Policy. We will post notice of the new policy 
from the Privacy Policy link on the homepage of our Website. Your use of our Website 
following any such change constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by 
the Privacy Policy, as changed. If we make any significant changes regarding disclosure 
of personally identifiable information to third parties, we will attempt to notify 
you prior to the date the modified policy takes effect.<br>
