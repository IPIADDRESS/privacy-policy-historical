        Collect and Use</font> <br>
        eSignal reserves the right to use and control the information collected 
        on the Website. We will not share this information with any third party, 
        other than as disclosed in this policy. eSignal collects information from 
        users at different points on our Website and through our software, as 
        follows:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> 3.1. Registration: In order to subscribe to eSignal products and services, 
          we require that you complete a registration form. This form may ask 
          for contact information, such as name, address, email address, telephone 
          number, company name, fax number and other basic contact information 
          ("Registration Information"). After submitting your Registration 
          Information, you can view and modify this information within the Self-Maintenance 
          area of the Website. You agree to notify eSignal of any change to your 
          billing address within thirty (30) days of such change. eSignal will 
          record the date and time that your Registration Information is created 
          or modified by you.</p>
        <p>3.2. Order: When you subscribe to an eSignal product, we request the 
          appropriate billing information on our order form. This information 
          includes credit card number, expiration date and billing address ("Order 
          Information"). Order Information is kept with your Registration 
          Information in a database and will be retained for future purchases.</p>
        <p>3.3. eSignal Software: While accessing and operating an eSignal subscription, 
          the eSignal software will record general statistical and tracking information, 
          such as the date and time a client accesses his or her product and the 
          time spent using it. The eSignal software transfers this information 
          to eSignal's servers, and such information is used strictly and exclusively 
          for internal resource management purposes.</p>
        <p>3.4. Other: eSignal may automatically receive and record information 
          in our server logs from your browser, including your IP address (the 
          Internet address of your PC), your computer's name, the type and version 
          of your web browser, referrer addresses and other generally-accepted 
          log information. We may also record page views (hit counts) and other 
          general statistical and tracking information, which will be aggregated 
          with that of other users in order to understand how our Website is being 
          used.</p>
        <p>3.5. Cookies: What is a cookie? A cookie is a small amount of data, 
          which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to 
          your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's 
          hard drive. Cookies can be used to provide you with a tailored user 
          experience and to make it easier for you to use the Website upon a future 
          visit. eSignal will retain cookies that are set on our Website and will 
          use them to recognize you when you return to our Website.</p>
        <p>3.6. Referrers: A "referrer" is the information passed along 
          by a web browser that references the web URL you linked from and is 
          automatically collected by our web server. This information is collected 
          and used by eSignal to understand the websites referring traffic to 
          our Website and to present appropriate content to our potential customers. 
          eSignal tabulates referrer information on an aggregate basis to identify 
          trends and traffic patterns.</p>
        <p>3.7. Partners: eSignal may enter into agreements with other companies 
          that market software or services that either function similarly to eSignal 
          software or that enhance or extend eSignal's functionality. Some of 
          these may be third party products that may utilize components of eSignal 
          software. Under the terms of these agreements, we may be required to 
          collect information about your sessions and your use of these third 
          party products and share this information with these third parties.</p>
        <p>3.8. Providers: A provider is an entity that agrees to pay for the 
          eSignal services being provided to you. We have entered into contractual 
          agreements with these providers governing the provider arrangement. 
          Under the terms of these agreements, we may be required to collect information 
          about your sessions and your use of your eSignal product and share this 
          information, along with your personally identifiable information, with 
          the provider paying for your eSignal service. This information is kept 
          strictly confidential, and is not shared with other third parties, except 
          as provided for in this privacy policy.</p>
        <p>3.9. Computer Configuration: In order to determine whether your computer 
          is supported by our system, we may collect certain anonymous information. 
          This information includes, but may not be limited to, your operating 
          system and browser, as well as the presence of the eSignal software 
          or other third party software on your computer. This information is 
          kept strictly confidential and is not shared with third parties, except 
          as provided for in this privacy policy.</p>

        We Collect and Use</font> <br>
        In general, except as provided in this policy, we will not disclose your 
        personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties without 
        your express consent. There are, however, some limited circumstances in 
        which we may need to disclose personally identifiable information about 
        a user, including, but not limited to, the circumstances set forth below:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>4.1. eSignal Site Vendors: We may employ other companies to perform 
          functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, providing customer 
          service, sending print and electronic mail, processing credit card payments, 
          or other functions necessary to our business. We may need to share your 
          personally identifiable information with these companies. However, we 
          will provide them with only that information necessary to perform their 
          functions, and we will not allow them to use your personally identifiable 
          information for any other purpose.</p>
        <p>4.2. eSignal Publishers and Merchants: eSignal reserves the right to 
          provide to publishers and other merchants for whom eSignal sells or 
          distributes products or services any personally identifiable information 
          as is necessary to fulfill any requests you may make for their products 
          or services. In addition, merchants of the products you purchase or 
          to which you subscribe through eSignal may request additional personally 
          identifiable information from you. eSignal will provide the merchants 
          of such products the information you supply in response to those requests 
          and, following such disclosure by eSignal, your personally identifiable 
          information will no longer be covered by this policy. In those instances, 
          your personally identifiable information is governed by the privacy 
          policy of the merchants whose products you have purchased or to which 
          you have subscribed.</p>
        <p>4.3. Imminent Harm: We may reveal your personally identifiable information 
          to attorneys, private investigator organizations or law enforcement 
          agencies if we believe that you are harming or interfering (or will 
          imminently harm or interfere) with other eSignal users or anyone else 
          or violating (either intentionally or unintentionally) our Terms and 
          Conditions of Use or infringing any of eSignal's legal rights.</p>
        <p>4.4. Legal: eSignal will reveal your personally identifiable information, 
          to the extent we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law. 
          If we receive legal process calling for the disclosure of any of your 
          personally identifiable information we will attempt to notify you via 
          the email address you supplied during registration within a reasonable 
          amount of time before we respond to the request, unless such notification 
          is not permitted.</p>
        <p>4.5. Transfer of Site: eSignal shall be entitled to transfer to a third 
          party information it collects, including any personally identifiable 
          information, in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of 
          its assets.</p>

        To ensure that you have appropriate control over your personally identifiable 
        information, you can access your account (after supplying your user name 
        and password) in the Self-Maintenance area of our Website to update and/or 
        correct the information you have previously submitted.</p>
      <p>In addition, we provide you with the ability to decline -- or “opt-out 
        of” -- certain mailings and other materials we may offer. For these 
        materials, you will be able to specify whether you wish to opt-out by 
        following directions provided in the Self-Maintenance area, as further 
        detailed in Section 6.0 (Communications to out Users) of our Privacy Policy, 
        below. <br>
        Finally, if you request, we will remove your name and other personally 
        identifiable information from our databases. Please understand, however, 
        that it may be impossible to remove this information completely, due to 
        backups and records of deletions. If you wish to remove your name and 
        other personally identifiable information from our database, please create 
        an email with the term "Unsubscribe" in the subject line, and 
        send the email to the address listed in Section 12.0. As an alternative, 
        you may write to us with your request, at the mailing address listed below. 
        You will be removed from our databases generally within ten business days

        Users</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>6.1. eSignal: eSignal sends emails and/or postal mailings to new subscribers 
          and to provide to existing subscribers information regarding their specific 
          eSignal products. Periodically, eSignal will send news and information 
          to subscribers and other parties who have expressed interest in eSignal 
          and its products. These communications are an information service to 
          users who have indicated a preference to receive promotions relating 
          to eSignal's products, Site and services and to receive special offers 
          relating to third-party products, sites and services. You can opt out 
          of receiving these promotional communications through the Self-Maintenance 
          area of our Website. For so long as you use eSignal products and services 
          or otherwise maintain a business relationship with eSignal, however, 
          you may not opt out of receiving communications from eSignal relating 
          specifically to those products and services or business relationship.</p>
        <p>6.2. Third Parties: Except as described in this privacy policy, we 
          do not share personally identifiable information with anyone, unless 
          we have informed you of a change to our privacy policy and given you 
          the opportunity to then choose to opt out. Once you have indicated that 
          your information may be shared with third parties or you have responded 
          to an offer by any third party on the Website, eSignal can no longer 
          update any of your personally identifiable information that has been 
          transferred to such third parties or opt you out of such third parties 
          so that you no longer receive their promotional and/or marketing information. 
          Instead, you must either contact that third party or refer to its privacy 
          policy to update your personally identifiable information or to let 
          the third party know that you no longer want to receive promotional 
          and/or marketing information about its products, services or offerings.</p>

      <p><font color="006699"><a name="7x" id="7x"></a>7.0 Security of Personally 
        Identifiable Information </font><br>
        eSignal maintains controls to protect the financial information you provide 
        us, including credit card details, during the product purchase process. 
        These controls include: (1) the use of SSL encryption to safeguard information 
        when transmitted from your web browser to eSignal; (2) the logical authentication 
        security within the databases that store customers' credit card numbers; 
        and (3) use of encryption of credit card numbers.<br>
        <br>
        eSignal employees are required to acknowledge that they understand and 
        will strictly abide by our corporate policies with respect to the confidentiality 
        of personally identifiable information. Moreover, eSignal only gives access 
        to databases containing personally identifiable information to employees 
        on a need-to-know basis. Internal policies require that passwords be changed 
        regularly, pursuant to security protocols. Our security procedures are 
        reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that they remain current.<br>
        <br>
        Accordingly, we have put in place security systems designed to prevent 
        unauthorized disclosure of information you provide to us. These systems 
        are structured to deter and prevent hackers and others from accessing 
        this information. Due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving 
        technologies, however, we cannot provide, and disclaim, assurance that 
        the information you provide us will remain free from loss, misuse, or 
        alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized 
        access.<br>

        Persons under the age of eighteen are not permitted to register for the 
        eSignal service and eSignal does not knowingly collect, either online 
        or offline, personally identifiable information from persons under the 
        age of eighteen. If we learn that a child under 18 has provided us with 
        personally identifiable information, we will delete this information from

        third parties, we will attempt to contact you prior to the date the modified 
        policy takes effect. We will also post notice of the new policy from the
