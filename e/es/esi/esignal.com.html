              we request the appropriate billing information on our order form.
              This information includes your credit card number, expiration date
              and billing address (“Order Information”). Order Information
              is kept with your Registration Information in a database and will be
              retained for future purchases.&nbsp; You may also provide personal
              information to us when you voluntarily communicate with us, such as
              for requesting information or submitting an application for employment.&nbsp; We
              may retain such information for use and disclosure consistent with
              this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>3.3. eSignal Software: While accessing and operating
              an eSignal product, the eSignal software will record general statistical
              and tracking information, such as the date and time a client accesses
              his or her product and the time spent using it. The eSignal software
              transfers this information to eSignal’s servers, and such
              information is used exclusively for internal resource management
              purposes.</p>
          <p>3.4.
              Other: eSignal may automatically receive and record information
              in our server logs from your browser, including your IP address
              (the Internet address of your PC), your computer’s name,
              the type and version of your web browser, referrer addresses and
              other generally-accepted log information. We may also record page
              views (hit counts) and other general statistical and tracking information,
              which will be aggregated with that of other users in order to understand
              how our Websites are being used.</p>
          <p>3.5. Cookies: A cookie is a small amount of data, which
              often includes unique, but anonymous, code, which is sent to your
              browser from a website’s
              computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies
              can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience and
              to make it easier for you to use the Websites upon a future visit.
              eSignal will also use cookies to recognize you when you return
              to our Websites. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by
              default, though you can manually disable the cookies feature of
              your browser. You should review the online documentation of your
              browser or consult with the provider of your browser for instructions
              on how to disable cookies. Please note that if you disable cookies
              on your computer, some parts of the Websites may not function properly.</p>
          <p>3.6. Referrers: A “referrer” is
              the information passed along by a web browser that references the
              web URL you linked from and is automatically collected by our web
              server. This information is collected and used by eSignal to understand
              the websites referring traffic to our Websites and to present appropriate
              content to our potential customers. eSignal tabulates referrer
              information on an aggregate basis to identify trends and traffic
              patterns.</p>
          <p>3.7.
              Partners: eSignal may enter into agreements with other companies
              that market software or services that either function similarly
              to eSignal software or that enhance or extend eSignal’s functionality.
              Some of these may be third party products that may utilize components
              of eSignal software. Under the terms of these agreements, we may
              be required to collect information about your sessions and your
              use of these third party products and share this information with
              these third parties.</p>
          <p>3.8. Providers: A provider is an entity that agrees to pay
              for the eSignal services being provided to you. We have entered into
              contractual agreements with these providers governing the provider
              arrangement. Under the terms of these agreements, we may be required
              to collect information about your sessions and your use of your eSignal
              product and share this information, along with your personally identifiable
              information, with the provider paying for your eSignal service. This
              information is kept strictly confidential, and is not shared with other
              third parties, except as provided for in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>3.9. Computer
              Configuration: In order to determine whether your computer is supported
              by our system, we may collect certain anonymous information. This information
              includes, but may not be limited to, your operating system and browser,
              as well as the presence of the eSignal software or other third party
              software on your computer. This information is kept strictly confidential
              and is not shared with third parties, except as provided in this Privacy
              Policy.</p>

      <p><font color="006699"><a name="4x" id="4x"></a>4.0 What We Do with Information 
We Collect and Use</font> <br>
In general, except as provided in this policy, we will not disclose your personally
identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties without your express consent
or allowing you to decline to permit the disclosure. There are, however, some
limited circumstances in which we may need to disclose personally identifiable
information about a user without express consent, including, but not limited
to, the circumstances set forth below:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>4.1. eSignal Website Vendors: We may employ
        other companies to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders,
        providing customer service, sending print and electronic mail, processing
        credit card payments, or other functions necessary to our business. In order
        to allow these companies to perform their obligations, we may need to share
        your personally identifiable information with them. However, we will provide
        these companies with only that information necessary to perform their functions
        on our behalf, and we will not allow them to use your personally identifiable
        information for any other purpose.</p>
    <p>4.2. Resellers: eSignal may from time to
        time enter into agreements with companies that resell eSignal’s products
        or services, either on eSignal’s behalf,
        or on their own behalf on a private labeled basis and/or on a co-branded
        basis. Under the terms of these agreements, we may be required, and therefore
        we reserve the right, to share your personally identifiable information
        with such resellers. Once your personally identifiable information is
        provided to such resellers, it will no longer be covered by this privacy
        policy. In those instances, your personally identifiable information
        will be governed by the privacy policy of the resellers to whom it is
        provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, eSignal will not share your
        Order Information with any reseller that is not billing you directly
        for the re-marketed, private labeled and/or co-branded eSignal services
        to which you subscribe.</p>
    <p> 4.3. eSignal Publishers and Merchants: eSignal reserves the right to provide
        to publishers and other merchants for whom eSignal sells or distributes products
        or services any personally identifiable information as is necessary to fulfill
        any requests you may make for their products or services. In addition, merchants
        of the products you purchase or to which you subscribe through eSignal may
        request additional personally identifiable information from you. eSignal
        will provide the merchants of such products the information you supply in
        response to those requests and, following such disclosure by eSignal, your
        personally identifiable information will no longer be covered by this policy.
        In those instances, your personally identifiable information is governed
        by the privacy policy of the merchants whose products you have purchased
        or to which you have subscribed.</p>
    <p>4.4. Protection of Rights: We may reveal
        your personally identifiable information to attorneys, private investigator
        organizations or law enforcement agencies if we believe that you have
        harmed or interfered with&nbsp; (or will imminently
        harm or interfere) other eSignal users or anyone else or violating (either
        intentionally or unintentionally) our Website Terms and Conditions of Use
        or infringing any of eSignal’s legal rights, or harming the legal
        rights, property, or health or safety of any other person.</p>
    <p>4.5. Required by Law: eSignal
        will reveal your personally identifiable information, to the extent we
        reasonably believe we are required to do so by law. If we receive legal
        process calling for the disclosure of any of your personally identifiable
        information we will attempt to notify you via the email address you supplied
        during registration within a reasonable amount of time before we respond
        to the request, unless such notification is not permitted.</p>
    <p>4.6. Asset Transfers: eSignal shall be entitled to transfer to a third party
        information it maintains, including any personally identifiable information,
        in connection with a transaction or proceeding involving a transfer of some or
        all of the assets relating to the Websites or a business in connection with which
        such information is maintained.

<p><font color="006699"><a name="5x" id="5x"></a>5.0 Changing or Removing  Personal
    Information; Opting Out </font><br>
    To ensure that you have appropriate control over your personally identifiable
    information, you can access your account (after supplying your user name
    and password) in the Self-Maintenance area of our Websites to update and/or
    correct the information you have previously submitted. <br>
    <br>
In addition, we provide you with the ability to decline -- or “opt-out
of” -- certain mailings and other materials we may offer. For these materials,
you will be able to specify whether you wish to opt-out by following directions
provided in the Self-Maintenance area, as further detailed in Section 6.0 (Communications
to out Users) of our Privacy Policy, below.</p>
<p>Finally, if you request, we will remove
    your name and other personally identifiable information from our active databases.
    Please understand, however, that it may be impossible to remove this information
    completely, due to backups and records of deletions. If you wish to remove
    your name and other personally identifiable information from our database,
    please create an email with the term “Unsubscribe” in
    the subject line, and send the email to the address listed in Section 12.0 of
    this Privacy Policy. As an alternative, you may write to us with your request,
    at the mailing address set forth in Section 12.0. You will be removed from our
    databases generally within ten business days of our receipt of your request.
    You may also request to review or amend any personal information that we maintain
    about you, by sending a written request to the same address, subject to our verification
    of your identity acceptance of any proposed revision. </p>
<p><font color="006699"><a name="6x" id="6x"></a>6.0 Communications to our Users</font></p>
<blockquote> 
<p>6.1. eSignal: eSignal sends emails and/or postal mailings to new subscribers
    and to provide to existing subscribers information regarding their specific
    eSignal products. Periodically, eSignal will send news and information to
    subscribers and other parties who have expressed interest in eSignal and
    its products. You can opt out of receiving these promotional communications
    through the Self-Maintenance area of our Websites. For so long as you use
    eSignal products and services or otherwise maintain a business relationship
    with eSignal, however, you may not opt out of receiving communications from
    eSignal relating specifically to those products and services or business
    relationship.</p>
6.2. Third Parties: Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share
personally identifiable information with anyone, unless we have informed you
of a change to our Privacy Policy and given you the opportunity to then choose
to opt out. eSignal can no longer update any of your personally identifiable
information once it has been transferred to such third parties and cannot implement
or impose your opt out requests upon such third parties. Instead, you must either
contact that third party or refer to its privacy policy to update your personally
identifiable information or to let the third party know that you no longer want
to receive promotional and/or marketing information about its products, services
or offerings.</blockquote>
<p><font color="006699"><a name="7x" id="7x"></a>7.0 Security of Personally Identifiable 
Information </font><br>
eSignal maintains controls to protect the financial information you provide us,
including credit card details, during the product purchase process. These controls
include: (1) the use of SSL encryption to safeguard information when transmitted
from your web browser to eSignal; (2) the logical authentication security within
the databases that store customers’ credit card numbers; and (3) use of
encryption of credit card numbers. <br>
<br>
eSignal employees are required to acknowledge that they understand and will strictly
abide by our corporate policies with respect to the confidentiality of personally
identifiable information. Moreover, eSignal only gives access to databases containing
personally identifiable information to employees on a need-to-know basis. Internal
policies require that passwords be changed regularly, pursuant to security protocols.
Our security procedures are reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that they
remain current.</p>
 Accordingly, we have put in place security systems designed to prevent unauthorized
 disclosure of information you provide to us. These systems are structured to
 deter and prevent hackers and others from accessing this information. Due to
 the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, however, we
 cannot provide, and disclaim, assurance that the information you provide us
 will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties who, despite
 our efforts, obtain unauthorized access. 
 <p><font color="006699"><a name="8x" id="8x"></a>8.0 Children</font> <br>
     Persons under the age of eighteen (18) are not permitted to register for
     the eSignal service and eSignal does not knowingly collect, either online
     or offline, personally identifiable information from persons under the age
     of eighteen (18). If we learn that a child under the age of eighteen (18)
     has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will attempt
     to delete this information from our databases, subject to any technical
     limitations on our ability to do so.<br>
     <br>
     <font color="006699"><a name="9x" id="9x"></a>9.0 Notification of Changes</font> 
     <br>
     eSignal reserves the right to change or modify this Privacy Policy from
     time to time, or to terminate this Privacy Policy. We will post notice of
     the new policy from the Privacy Policy link on the homepage of our Websites.
     Your use of our Websites following any such change constitutes your agreement
     to follow and be bound by the Privacy Policy, as changed. If we make any
     significant changes regarding disclosure of personally identifiable information
     to third parties, we will attempt to notify you prior to the date the modified
     policy takes effect.<br>
