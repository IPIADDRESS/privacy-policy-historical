<h3>What this Privacy Policy Covers</h3>
<p>This Privacy Statement applies to Edfinancial Services and governs data collection and usage at all Edfinancial Services sites and services such as <a title="Edfinancial Services - servicing federal and private student loans" href="http://www.Edfinancial.com">www.Edfinancial.com</a>.</p>
<p>Edfinancial Services is a servicer of student loans and provides various online services for other providers of educational funding. You may access some services provided by Edfinancial Services with pages that are co-branded through the site of one of our partner lenders. It is important to note that this privacy policy does not apply to other areas of that lender's site that are not provided by Edfinancial Services.</p>
<p>Some areas of our websites may provide links to non-Edfinancial Services sites. If you link to a site that is not an Edfinancial Services website, the privacy policy of that site and its terms of Use of use apply to you. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policy of any third party before giving personal information to them.</p>
<h3>Use of Personal Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Edfinancial Services does not collect any nonpublic personal information from visitors to our sites unless you expressly provide it to us through one of our online services. Edfinancial Services does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. If you choose to register on an Edfinancial Services website in order to utilize an online service that requires you to log in, Edfinancial Services will collect basic information such as name, email address and brief demographic information. If you choose to submit an online loan application, Edfinancial Services will collect information such as your Social Security Number, and that of your endorser or co-borrower, if applicable, date of birth, driver's license number, phone number, and references required for the completion of a student loan application.&nbsp; If you choose to select a lender that is not serviced by Edfinancial Services and wish your request to be submitted to your school,&nbsp; Edfinancial Services will collect information such as the borrower and/or student name, phone number and e-mail address and the lender name, code and phone number.&nbsp; Edfinancial Services will store this information for six (6) months for purposes of research, resend requests, and to send via batch to your school.</p>
<p>We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The type of information we collect includes, pages visited, product, school and lender codes, IP address, the type of browser you are using, the websites you visit immediately before and immediately after you visit our websites, and other anonymous data involving your use of our websites. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used.</p>
<p>Edfinancial Services enables you to voluntarily provide personal information to third parties such as college or university admissions departments. This information will not be provided by Edfinancial Services to any third party other than the colleges or universities that you select. The selected university will be communicating with you, and the university's use of your data is governed by its privacy policy.</p>
<p>If you elect to use our referral service for informing a friend about one of our sites, Edfinancial Services will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting them to view the article that you are sending them. Edfinancial Services does not store this information, and it is for the sole purpose of sending the one-time email.</p>
<p>If you choose not to uncheck the Newsletter box on your registration form, you agree that Edfinancial Services may periodically send you an e-mail newsletter which includes educational or marketing information to the email address with which you registered. If you choose not to uncheck the Offers box on your registration form, you agree that Edfinancial Services or Edamerica, Inc. may periodically send educational or marketing information to the email address with which you registered.&nbsp; You may unsubscribe to either service at any time in the newsletter or registration areas of the sites or by visiting <a title="Edfinancial Services - servicing federal and private student loans" href="https://loans.edfinancial.com/LoginApp/Default.aspx">our login manager</a>. After logging into your account, select edit my account information.&nbsp; You may then opt out of the Newsletter or Offers by unchecking the appropriate box.&nbsp; If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may also opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication.&nbsp; You may also contact us for assistance at <a href="mailto:info@edfinancial.com">info@edfinancial.com</a> or by calling 1-800-337-6884. You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.</p>
<p>Certain processes, such as online loan applications, will require that you provide your social security number and date of birth if you choose to continue with the online process. Once this information is provided, it will be associated by Edfinancial Services with the user account that is then logged on, and you will not need to provide it again. Thereafter, you will only need your username and password to access your account information or to complete forms in other processes. For your security, the social security number that you enter cannot be used with any other account.</p>
<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law where in we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
<h3>Minimum Age Requirement</h3>
<p>By law, Edfinancial Services cannot collect any information from persons who are not yet 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, you can utilize the information provided in many areas of our site, but you are not authorized to create an account.</p>

This information is then used to improve the usefulness of the sites.</p>
<h3>Confidentiality and Security</h3>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.&nbsp; When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).&nbsp; [To learn more about SSL, visit <a title="Information on secure socket layers" href="http://info.ssl.com/article.aspx?id=10241">http://info.ssl.com/article.aspx?id=10241</a>.]</p>
<p>In addition to the use of SSL technology, we follow industry accepted best practices for protecting personal information; both during transmission and at rest on our systems. While no method of communication over the Internet, or electronic storage is ever 100% secure; we have gone to great lengths to protect your personal information through the use of layered firewalls, intrusion detection/protection systems, file level encryption of data while at rest and encryption of data while in transit over our network. All systems provide extensive logging and automated reporting of issues enabling timely response, interdiction and corrective actions if necessary.</p>

<p>If you forget your password, there is a link on the log-in page that will enable you to enter your Username or Email address with which you originally registered.
