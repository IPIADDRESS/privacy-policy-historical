By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors. We do not link an IP address with the identity of a computer user.</p>
<p>
	Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law where in we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.</p>

<h3>
	Website Use Information</h3>
<p>
	Web servers at Edfinancial Services automatically recognize your domain name, but not your email address. No nonpublic personal information is collected unless you choose to provide it to us through one of our online services.

<h3>
	Confidentiality and Security</h3>
<p>
	The security of your personal information is important to us.&nbsp; When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).&nbsp; To learn more about SSL, visit <a href="http://info.ssl.com/article.aspx?id=10241">http://info.ssl.com/article.aspx?id=10241</a>.</p>
<p>
	In addition to the use of SSL technology, we follow industry-accepted best practices for protecting personal information, both during transmission and at rest on our systems. While no method of communication over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% secure, we have gone to great lengths to protect your personal information through the use of layered firewalls, intrusion detection/protection systems, file level encryption of data while at rest and encryption of data while in transit over our network. All systems provide extensive logging and automated reporting of issues enabling timely response, interdiction and corrective actions if necessary.</p>

<h3>
	Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>
	Edfinancial Services may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect company and customer feedback. We encourage you to periodically review this Policy to be informed of how Edfinancial Services is protecting your information. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days.</p>

<aside class="make-modal" id="loan-types"><h3 class="modal-heading" data-icon="question">
	Which loan type do you have?</h3>
<p>
	<strong>There are two types of federal student loan programs: Direct Loans and FFELP Loans.</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program Loans (Direct Loans)</strong>: As of July 1, 2010, all federal student loans are funded by the federal government through the Federal Direct Loan Program. Loan types include Direct Stafford, Direct Parent PLUS, Direct Graduate Student PLUS (GradPLUS) loans, and Direct Consolidation loans. These student loans have low interest rates and flexible repayment terms. There are a limited number of organizations designated by the U.S. Department of Education to service these loans. If you have Direct Loans, your billing statement will reference “Direct” and/or “Edfinancial.com/DL”.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Federal Family Education Loan Program Loans (FFELP Loans)</strong>: FFELP loans were available through private lenders prior to July 1, 2010 (you may have chosen a private lender from a list when you originated your loan) and were guaranteed by the federal government.&nbsp; FFELP loan types include Stafford, Parent PLUS, GradPLUS, and Consolidation loans. FFELP loans have similar terms and conditions to Direct Loans, but there are some differences in repayment plans, loan forgiveness programs, borrower benefits, and interest rates.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Private student loans:</strong> Not guaranteed by the federal government, private loans are similar to bank loans, and their interest rates may be based on an index, such as Prime or LIBOR. The interest rate for private loans will depend on the borrower’s, and sometimes the co-borrower’s, credit history. Private loans are intended to close the gap between the amount students can borrow under the federal student loan programs and the cost of higher education.</p>
<p>
