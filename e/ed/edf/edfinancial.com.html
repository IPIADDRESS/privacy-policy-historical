<h3>
	What this Privacy Policy Covers</h3>
<p>
	This Privacy Statement applies to Edfinancial Services and governs data collection and usage at all Edfinancial Services sites and services such as <a href="http://www.Edfinancial.com">www.Edfinancial.com</a>.<br>
	<br>
	Edfinancial Services is a servicer of student loans and provides various online services for other providers of educational funding. You may access some services provided by Edfinancial Services with pages that are co-branded through the site of one of our partner lenders. It is important to note that this privacy policy does not apply to other areas of that lender's site that are not provided by Edfinancial Services.<br>
	<br>
	Some areas of our websites may provide links to non-Edfinancial Services sites. If you link to a site that is not an Edfinancial Services website, the privacy policy of that site and its terms of use apply to you. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policy of any third party before giving personal information to them.</p>
<h3>
	Use of Personal Identifying Information</h3>
<p>
	Edfinancial Services does not collect any nonpublic personal information from visitors to our sites unless you expressly provide it to us through one of our online services. Edfinancial Services does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Certain processes, such as our secure <a href="https://www.edservicing.com/customercarequestions" title="email contact form">email contact form</a>, will require that you provide your student loan account number and date of birth so that we may answer specific questions to assist you with your account(s).</p>
<p>
	We currently use Google Analytics to track visitors by collecting anonymous statistics with first-party cookies, small text files with a single string of anonymous text or numbers. We do not collect any personally identifiable information about website visitors using this tool. The type of information we collect includes pages visited, product, school and lender codes, IP address, the type of browser you are using, the websites you visit immediately before and immediately after you visit our websites, and other anonymous data involving your use of our websites. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. We do not link an IP address with the identity of a computer user.</p>
<p>
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law where in we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
<h3>
	Data Retention</h3>
<p>
	We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us via our <a href="https://www.edservicing.com/customercarequestions" target="_blank" title="email contact form">email contact form</a>. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<h3>
	Minimum Age Requirement</h3>
<p>
	By law, Edfinancial Services cannot collect any information from persons who are not yet 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, you can utilize the information provided in many areas of our site, but you are not authorized to create an account.</p>
<h3>
	Updating Personal Information</h3>
<p>
	You may update or modify or delete basic personal information associated with your student loan account(s) by logging into the <a href="/MMA" title="Manage My Account">Manage My Account</a> borrower portal or by contacting us via our <a href="https://www.edservicing.com/customercarequestions" target="_blank" title="email contact form">email contact form</a>.</p>
<h3>
	Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>
	If you choose to register with the Edfinancial Services Sites in order to utilize a service that requires you to log in, your user ID will be stored in a temporary "cookie" on your web browser. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server to help us identify you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. The cookie that manages your login will be removed as soon as you close your browser. Other cookies that are used are for customization of content and contain no personally identifying information. Our cookies are not used to collect any nonpublic personal information. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
<h3>
	Website Use Information</h3>
<p>
	Web servers at Edfinancial Services automatically recognize your domain name, but not your e-mail address. No nonpublic personal information is collected unless you choose to provide it to us through one of our online services. Our web server does collect information such as domain name, number of hits, pages visited and length of user session in order to compile website statistics that enable us to analyze how our websites are used. This information is then used to improve the usefulness of the sites.</p>
<h3>
	Confidentiality and Security</h3>
<p>
	The security of your personal information is important to us.&nbsp; When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).&nbsp; To learn more about SSL, visit <a href="http://info.ssl.com/article.aspx?id=10241">http://info.ssl.com/article.aspx?id=10241</a>.</p>
<p>
	In addition to the use of SSL technology, we follow industry-accepted best practices for protecting personal information, both during transmission and at rest on our systems. While no method of communication over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% secure, we have gone to great lengths to protect your personal information through the use of layered firewalls, intrusion detection/protection systems, file level encryption of data while at rest and encryption of data while in transit over our network. All systems provide extensive logging and automated reporting of issues enabling timely response, interdiction and corrective actions if necessary.</p>
<p>
	If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us via our <a href="https://www.edservicing.com/customercarequestions" target="_blank" title="email contact form">email contact form</a>.</p>
<h3>
	Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>
	Edfinancial Services may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect company and customer feedback. We encourage you to periodically review this Policy to be informed of how Edfinancial Services is protecting your information. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days.</p>
