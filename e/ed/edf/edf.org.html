</p><p> This means information

  card to make a donation). 

        </p><p>If you visit our sites

          releases, we collect and store only the following information about 
          you: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for 
          example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, 
          or princeton.edu if you are connecting from Princeton University's domain); 
          the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the

        </p><p>If you ask for 
          one of our many personalized or enhanced services, we will ask you to 
          provide us with personally identifiable information. On our Scorecard 
          website, it might be your zip code, so we can guide you to information 
          about your local neighborhood. In other cases you might be asked for 
          your name, address, etc. as part of registering to use Action Network, 
          to become a member, or to use other services<b>. </b>We want to be very 
          clear: we will not obtain this kind of personally-identifying information
