<p><b><a name="cookieprefs"></a><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">How 
  to Change Your Cookie Preferences</font></b></p>
<font size="4">
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In <b>Netscape</b>, select 
  "edit" from top menu bar, and choose "preferences". A dialog box will open revealing 
  a menu of "categories". Choose "advanced" and on the bottom right, there are 
  three cookie options. You can choose among "Accept all cookies," "Accept only 
  cookies that are sent back to the generating server" or "Disable cookies." </font></p>
</font> 
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Below these choices you 
  may also choose "Warn me before accepting a cookie," which will instruct your 
  computer to alert you when a website is trying to place a cookie, which you 
  can either accept or cancel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In <b>Internet Explorer</b>, 
  select "tools" from top menu bar and choose "internet options". Click on the 
  "security" tab at the top of the dialog box. Click "custom level" button. A 
  new box opens called "security settings." Scroll down to the cookies section. 
  There are two options. "Allow cookies that are stored on your computer" gives 
  three choices about cookies that will remain on your computer unless you delete 
  them. "Disable" will instruct websites to not place a cookie onto your computer. 
  "Enable" will allow cookies to be stored on your computer. "Prompt" will ask 
  you each time whether you would like to accept a cookie from a particular site.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"Allow per-session cookies" 
  will give you the same three options, but the computer will only save a cookie 
  while your browser window is open during your time online. These cookies will 
  not be permanently stored on your computer.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Choose which option 
          you would like to implement and hit the "okay" button. The 
          Securities option dialog box will close. Hit the "okay" button 
          in the Internet options dialog box, and your cookie preferences will 
          be set until you change them again.</font></p>
