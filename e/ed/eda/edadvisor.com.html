Cookies are text files that are placed in your computer's browser by a Web page server, and that can be used to help recognize you as an Edvisors user. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies may store user preferences and other information, and can be deleted or blocked by changing the settings on your Web browser. You may also be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.  However, choosing to decline cookies may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on Edvisors websites.</p>

<p><b>Analytics Tools and Third Party Cookies:</b> Edvisors uses temporary cookies to help us determine how people travel through our site. A temporary cookie expires when you close your browser. This website also uses third-party analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) to collect information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use this information only to improve this site. Such tools use permanent cookies to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Edvisors. Third-parties providing such analytics tools may also transfer this information to other third-parties where required to do so by law, or where such third-parties process the information on their behalf. The third-party analytics provider cannot associate your IP address with your personally identifiable information. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by a third-party click tracking analytics provider in the manner and for the purposes set out above. </p>

<p><b>Online Advertising Networks and Third Party Cookies:</b> Edvisors sometimes runs online ad campaigns that display Edvisors ads to you based on your likely interests. We may learn your likely interests when you use our websites and from other companies and websites that help us understand your likely interests. These types of ads are often called "interest-based ads" or "online behavioral advertising." We hire "ad networks" to display these ads on websites across the Internet.</p>

<p>The ad networks we hire to display these ads set their own cookies on your browser and use web beacons to measure the effectiveness of these ads and to understand your likely interests. Our ad networks and Edvisors both learn which Edvisors ads are shown to you, which ads are clicked on, and on which web page the ads were displayed.</p>
