<b>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b><br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Use CODE/SYNTAX tags</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">Code  or logs posted in messages should be enclosed in code tags, this limits  the space they occupy and makes them easier to read and understand by  showing indents and highlighting keywords. Please read </font><a href="http://www.edaboard.com/announcements31.html" target="_blank"><font color="#1155cc"><u>this</u></font></a><font color="#000000"> tutorial that explains how to apply them.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Select the proper section and don’t post duplicates</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">Please  post your question in the proper forum section, this will help you get  replies faster. If your question can fit in more than one category then  select the section that seems more appropriate. If you're not sure where  to post, ask a moderator first.</font><br>
<font color="#000000">Duplicates  or cross posting are not allowed, avoid creating multiple threads with  similar questions, ask all related questions in one thread.</font><br>
<font color="#000000">There  are specific sections for education, jobs and business promotion so use  them correctly and don’t post content that belongs in these sections to  any other categories.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Use descriptive titles</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">Use  proper descriptive titles related to the content of your post without adding useless prefix like "urgent" or "help me" or excessive punctuation like "...." or "!!!!" etc.  Give a  short summary of your problem IN THE SUBJECT . Titles like the following  are considered completely useless and will result in the deletion of  the thread and an infraction:</font><br>
<ul><li style=""><font color="#000000">Help me</font></li><li style=""><font color="#000000">You must know the answer</font></li><li style=""><font color="#000000">Very urgent</font></li><li style=""><font color="#000000">I have a question</font></li><li style=""><font color="#000000">Stupid question</font></li><li style=""><font color="#000000">Newbie needs help</font> </li></ul><br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Blog content</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">Blogs are not the place to advertise your website or business neither ask questions. Post there only articles or own ideas that you want show to others.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Uploaded files</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">Don’t  upload files that are widely available in the internet and can be found  easily like datasheets or application notes, this is a waste of  valuable bandwidth, post a link instead.</font><br>
<font color="#000000">Also  format your image attachments properly, use an image  resolution that  is easily readable, not too big or too small and use gif, png, or jpeg  extension to reduce the size of the file.</font><br>
<font color="#000000">Avoid  using bmp image format, it occupies a huge size compared to the formats  described above and can’t be shown directly in a browser which is an  additional inconvenience.</font><br>
<font color="#000000">If your code is long prefer to use a zip file to attach it in the post instead of directly posting it.</font><br>
<font color="#000000">Don’t  upload your files to external servers and post the links, these files  will be deleted after a while and the thread will become useless, attach  your files in the post. Moderators </font><font color="#000000"><b>will delete</b></font><font color="#000000"> any posts that includes files uploaded to file sharing servers like Rapidshare, 4shared etc. Try to uploads compressed formats that are easily opened by different operating systems, zip is preferred over rar or 7zip and note that the attachments should never be password protected.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Do not share or request copyright material</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">Do  not upload, attach, or otherwise post any copyrighted material which  you are not free to redistribute (subject to the licensing terms of the  specific item).

<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Do not create multiple accounts</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">Don’t  create multiple accounts in order to bump your thread or give helpful  ratings to yourself or your friends. Members found to have duplicate  accounts will be banned</font><font color="#000000"><b>.</b></font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Thread bumping is not allowed</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">Don't  bump your thread with useless followups like “please help” or “no one”  etc. and don’t be in a hurry to get a reply, be patient. If you have any  additional info to provide (like results gathered after the posted  question or additional info) then you are welcome to post them in order  to explain better your problem.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Do not spam or self-promote in the forums</b></font><br>

<font color="#000000">Spamming also includes sending private messages to a large number of different users.</font><br>
<font color="#000000"> If you intend to reply to a question with a content existing in your blog then you should include the content in the actual reply and provide an optional link to the article but not just a bare link. Do not search the forum for convenient question which match a content in your blog so that you can post a link and self-promote </font><br>

<br>
<font size="5"><b><font color="#000000"><b>FAQ</b></font></b></font><br>
<br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>What happens if I see a thread/post which has broken a rule?</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">Please  report the thread/post to the moderators using the report link which  appears  in the right-hand corner under each post. This report will be  sent to all moderators of that particular forum who will respond to the  incident as quickly as possible.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>I see something that is definitely spam. Should I do anything?</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">If  you see someone posting advertisements which are irrelevant to the  thread topic or simply any other form of spamming, please report the  post by clicking the "Report post" button.</font><br>
<font color="#000000">Please </font><font color="#000000"><b>Do Not</b></font><font color="#000000">  post any replies to that message such as "Go away, idiot," or "You're  stupid.", this only bumps the thread back to the top of the forum  listing, and makes the spammer's post(s) visible for a longer period of  time. Once you've reported the post or thread, a moderator will soon  take care of it as needed.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>What happens if I break a rule?</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">If  you break a rule, then you will either be warned or banned. A ban of  your user account may either be temporary or permanent. While a ban will  normally involve only a ban of your user account, in extreme  circumstances, it is possible to block your IP address from the forums.</font><br>
<font color="#000000">The  administrators and moderators also have the right to edit, delete, move  or close and thread or post as they see necessary, without prior  warning.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Editing and Deleting Your Posts</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">The  administrators have decided to prevent users from deleting their own  posts. In the past, deleting the first post of a thread would delete the  entire thread, making it impossible for others to be able to read and  learn from the information posted. There is also a limited amount of  time in which you are allowed to edit your post, after that the post  can’t be edited.</font><br>
<font color="#000000">As  a rule we do not remove or delete content from our forums so before you  post consider this rule. If you don’t want to share a schematic or code  then don’t post it but don’t expect to get help and then delete your  post, users in the forum spend valuable time in order to reply in your  post so this info should remain available for users that may have a  similar question in the future.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Why do some usernames appear in blue or red text?</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">Any  user who is an administrator or moderator will have their username  appear in a bold, red font. This addition has been made to the forum to  help make it obvious for new users to see who is in charge. A full list  of the moderators and the forums they moderate is available</font><a href="http://www.edaboard.com/showgroups.php" target="_blank"><font color="#1155cc"><u> here</u></font></a><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>What are the consequences of warnings and infractions</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">Warnings  serve as a reminder to you of the forum's rules which you are expected  to understand and follow. When you break a rule then you receive a  warning and if you keep breaking the rule then you get infraction  points. </font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>What are sticky threads?</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">'Sticky'  threads are created by moderators or administrators, and remain 'stuck'  to the top of the listing, even if they haven't had any posts recently.  Their purpose is to keep important information visible and accessible  at all times.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>I get a "no permission error", what do I do?</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">This  happens as you did not complete the registration process. To complete  the registration you must use the activation link in the e-mail sent to  you. This is to confirm the true identity of you. If you have not  received a registration e-mail, look in the spam folder as sometimes the  email is flagged as spam. If the e-mail has not been flagged as spam  then please</font><a href="http://www.edaboard.com/register.php?do=requestemail" target="_blank"><font color="#1155cc"><u> request another activation e-mail</u></font></a><font color="#000000">.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>I forgot my password. What can I do?</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">If you forget your password, you can click on the '</font><a href="http://www.edaboard.com/login.php?do=lostpw" target="_blank"><font color="#1155cc"><u>Forgotten Your Password</u></font></a><font color="#000000">' link. This will appear on any page that requires you to fill in your password.</font><br>
<font color="#000000">This  link brings up a page where you should enter your registered email  address. An email will be sent to that address shortly, with  instructions for resetting your password.</font><br>
<font color="#000000">Since  passwords are encrypted, there is no way to resend your original  password. This option provides you with the ability to reset your  password.</font><br>
<font color="#000000">You  must be able to receive emails to your registered email address for  this to work. You may need to check your spam filters and folder if you  do not see this email in a few minutes.</font><br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="5"><b><font color="#000000"><b>Guidelines</b></font></b></font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>USE SEARCH FIRST!</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">There  is a pretty good chance that unless you have some really odd or unique  problem that it has been addressed on this forum before (or even  hundreds of times before for some issues).</font><br>
<font color="#000000">Use  the forum's search feature first to see if there are already some good  threads on the subject. It's easy to search - just click the "Search"  button at the top left of the page.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Be descriptive</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">Take  the time to explain the problem you are facing properly and attach in  the post any available code, schematic or other related content.</font><br>
<font color="#000000">Posting  a huge code doesn’t help solve the problem, isolate the part where the  problem is and provide info about the error message you get and the line  number where it occurs.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Post content</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">Links  to external sites can often become "dead" or broken when these external  sites change their format or simply cease to exist, unfortunately there  are already several cases of old threads that have become useless this  way. The following measures will ensure the viability of the post,  regardless of the state of external sites.</font><br>
<font color="#000000">When  possible all posts should contain source code, simulation files,  schematics, photos, etc with the appropriate credit for the source of  these materials given. If the source code consists of multiple files or  is simply too lengthy to be posted directly, it should be compressed and  uploaded to the forum as an attachment.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Only you know what "doesn't work" means</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">Please  tell us what your circuit or code  is supposed to do and why it  "doesn't work".When you come in and say "it doesn't work" or just "it  has errors", that means NOTHING. There could be a million things wrong  and no one will know where to look.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Signature and Avatar Guidelines</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">The  contents of your sig must be acceptable for our community and shall not  contain any profanity, vulgarity, or insults/disparaging comments to  our community or its members. In addition, comments and/or advertising  links are not allowed.</font><br>
<br>
<br>
<ul><li style=""><font color="#000000">Keep  your signature and avatar in good taste, the contents of your signature  must be acceptable for the community: no vulgarity, lewd men/women,  profanity or insults to other community members.</font></li><li style=""><font color="#000000">Animation should be kept to a minimum and both your signature and avatar shouldn't be too distracting.</font></li><li style=""><font color="#000000">Do not include spam, harassing links or affiliate links in your signature.</font> </li></ul><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000">Any  signature violating these rules will be considered spam, they will be  deleted and the offending member will be addressed by our moderators.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Put your code in CODE or SYNTAX tags</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">When you include code in your posts you should always use </font><font color="#000000"><b>CODE </b></font><font color="#000000">or </font><font color="#000000"><b>SYNTAX </b></font><font color="#000000">tags,  these tags limit the length of the code and show the indents properly  so that the code is easier to read and doesn't occupy too much space.  Please read this tutorial to learn how to use code tags.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Solved threads</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">Please  mark your threads as solved when you have solved your problem so that  other users know that you don’t need any more help. If you find the  solution yourself please take the time to explain the solution so that  other users have similar issues can benefit from it.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><b>Replies</b></font><br>
<font color="#000000">Please  avoid replies like “google it” or “read the datasheet” or if you give  such answers provide a couple of links or the specific chapter/page that  the user should read.</font><br>
<font color="#000000">Don’t  reply to posts when you can’t help with the asked question and don’t  intrude in threads with a different subject or follow up with questions  unrelated to the thread content.</font><br>
