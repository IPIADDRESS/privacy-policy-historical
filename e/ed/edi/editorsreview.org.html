<h2>Legal Bases for Processing (For EEA Users)</h2>

<p>If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have a legal basis for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal basis depends on the services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:</p>

<ol>
	<li>It is necessary for the performance of a contract, such as to provide you with the services you requested, including to operate the services, provide customer support and personalized features, and to protect the safety and security of the services, including all processing necessary for the performance of our contract(s) with you;</li>
	<li>It satisfies a legitimate interest <em>that is not outweighed by your data protection rights and interests</em>, such as for research and development, to market and promote our services, and to protect our legal rights and interests;</li>
	<li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or</li>
	<li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of our information, including the data we collect about you described in this policy, is stored in the United States of America.</p>

<h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>

<p>We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction.</p>

<ol>

	<li>To contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them;</li>
	<li>To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Ad Practitioners’ assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by Ad Practitioners about our Websites users is among the assets transferred;</li>
	<li>To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it;</li>
	<li>For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information; and</li>
	<li>With your consent.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li>To comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request;</li>
	<li>To enforce or apply our Terms &amp; Conditions or Privacy Policy and other agreements; and</li>
	<li>If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Ad Practitioners, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Choices About How We Use and Disclose Information</h2>

<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:</p>

<ol>
	<li><em>Marketing Emails</em>. You can review and change your personal information in our marketing systems by using the unsubscribe function on our marketing emails.</li>

If you do not wish to have your contact information used by the Company to promote our own, you can opt out by checking the relevant box located on the form on which we collect your data. If we have sent you a promotional email, you may send us a return email asking to be omitted from future email distributions or use the opt-out feature in the email.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Third party links</h2>

<p>The Website contains links to websites operated and maintained by third parties over which Company has absolutely no control. Any information you provide to third party websites will be governed under the terms of the privacy policy of those respective third parties. Accordingly, we strongly encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing any information to the operators of third party websites, and to familiarize yourself with their privacy practices by reviewing their privacy policies.</p>

<p>inclusion of third party websites on or through our Websites in no way constitutes an express or implied endorsement of such websites' policies.</p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding Company’s Privacy Policy and or related practices, please feel free to contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:legal@editorsreview.org">legal@editorsreview.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Methods used to protect your information</h2>

<p>We use HTTPS to protect the confidentiality of your personal information including the use of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol and/or TLS (Transport Layer Security). We also use password encryption to protect all of the information stored in our database. In addition, our business practices are reviewed periodically for compliance with policies and procedures governing the security and confidentiality of its information. Our business practices limit employee access to confidential information and limit the use and disclosure of such information to authorized persons.</p>

<p>Our Websites use commercially reasonable technologies, processes and procedures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all personal data.</p>

<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Websites like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Websites.</p>

<p>However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and no data system can guarantee that it is free from error. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant that it will be safe from theft, loss, damage, and/or corruption. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. By using our Websites, you hereby agree that Company and its officers, directors, employees, shareholders, insurers, attorneys, vendors, agents and representatives, shall not be liable for any theft, loss, damage and/or corruption to your information, including but not limited to your personally identifiable information. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Websites, in this Privacy Policy, or on our Terms and Conditions.</p>

<h2>Your rights</h2>

<p>You have the right to know what data is being collected from you, where it’s being processed, how it’s being used, how long it is stored for, and who we share the information with. If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party have a legitimate interest in doing so, you have the right to object to that use. However, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Websites or our services. You may also request that we transfer or erase your personal data.</p>

<h2>How you can access or correct your information</h2>

<p>We do our best to respect your privacy rights and provide you access and control over your data. You can make any of the following requests regarding your data by sending an e-mail to compliance@editorsreview.org:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Access and review your data;</li>
	<li>Correct your data or request that we delete some or all of it;</li>
	<li>Obtain copies of your data in human and/or machine-readable format suitable for importing to other software; and</li>
	<li>Restrict us from using or processing your data.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because we use Amazon Web Services to backup our information, we cannot delete your specific information from our backups. The Amazon Web Services creates images of our database every day and stores them for 7 days. After 7 days have passed, the oldest images are deleted. Furthermore, during critical stages of system changes, we sometimes create manual backups. We retain these backups for no more than 7 days.</p>

<p>We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change or delete information if we believe the change or deletion would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.</p>

<p>If you delete your User Contributions from the Websites, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or might have been copied or stored by other Websites users. Proper access and use of information provided on the Websites, including User Contributions, is governed by our Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>

<h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>

<p>California Civil Code § 1798.83 permits users of our Websites that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to <a href="mailto:compliance@editorsreview.org">compliance@editorsreview.org</a>.</p>

<h2>How long your data is stored</h2>

<p>How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.</p>

<p><strong>Account information:</strong> We retain your account information until you delete your account. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations and to continue to develop and improve our Websites and Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.</p>

<p><strong>Information you share on the Services:</strong> If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display comments and content you provided to our Websites.</p>

<p><strong>Marketing information:</strong> If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences unless you specifically ask us to delete such information. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.</p>

<h2>Changes to privacy policy</h2>

<p>If Company’s Privacy Policy or procedures change, Company will immediately post those changes to the website. Any such changes will be effective immediately upon being posted, unless otherwise stated in the change.</p>
