                <div class="hr"></div>
                Generally, we do not collect information that personally identifies individuals except when individuals knowingly and voluntarily provide such information to us.  For example, we will gather information about individuals when they submit comments, questions or requests for information to us on this Website.

If you decide to register for a User Account or a Corporate Account (collectively, "<b>Accounts</b>"), you will be required to provide us with your name and contact information (including organization information for Corporate Accounts), and to choose a username and password.  For each Account, we will maintain and allow Account holders to view order history and order shipment status.  Account registrants may, but are not required to, provide us their credit card information for express checkout for orders on our Website (so that credit card information does not have to re-entered next time an order is placed from the Account); set up birthday or gift reminders within their Accounts; and create address book entries for recipients of the EDIBLE ARRANGEMENTS<sup>®</sup> arrangements or other products they order on this Website.  We will use this information to customize the experience on our Website.  We utilize industry-standard SSL technology to allow for the encryption of all Account registrations on our Website.
