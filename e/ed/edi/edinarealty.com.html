		</p><p><span class="reg">At Edina Realty Home Services, we know how important your personal privacy is to you. We recognize that you expect privacy and security when it comes to information that personally identifies you and allows you to be individually contacted ("Personal Information"). Edina Realty Home Services has adopted the following privacy policy because we understand the need to safeguard the information you may be providing to us at our web site.</span>

		</p><p><span class="bold">Why we request information about you.<br></span>
		<span class="reg">Edina Realty Home Services offers a variety of programs and services to you from personalized home searches to online mortgage applications. We collect and retain information about you only when we believe it will help us provide you with the services and products that you desire. When you sign up for our personalized home search, we may use that information to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to our web site, new Edina Realty Home Services products or services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, return to the <a href="/misc/myprofile/login.asp?source=&amp;propertyln=&amp;hotline="><b>My Profile</b></a> to change your preferences. 

		</span></p><p>When you request other information from us through our various order forms, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address and telephone numbers so we can be sure to get in touch with you when and how you ask us to. For instance, when you apply for an on-line mortgage loan, we need to know your name, social security number, e-mail address, mailing address, income, debt and asset information. This information is necessary to process your mortgage application and to obtain your credit report. We will not obtain your credit report without your authorization, but we cannot approve you for a mortgage loan without it. We can, however, pre-qualify you for a mortgage loan without your credit report.

		</p><p><span class="bold">How we protect your financial information.<br></span>
		<span class="reg">When you apply for an on-line mortgage loan, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure socket layer software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. You can tell you're protected by the small lock symbol in the corner of your Internet browser. The information we receive from you also is protected against unauthorized access once we receive it. We limit access to your information to employees who have a business reason for accessing it. We also educate our employees about the importance of your privacy through our educational programs and company policies.</span>

		</p><p><span class="bold">We use "cookies."<br></span>
		<span class="reg">Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies allow us to welcome you back to our site and provide you with your personalized home searches. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser to prevent cookies from being placed on your computer without your consent. You can still use our regular home search feature and every other function on our site even though your computer will not accept cookies. Display ads on our site may also contain cookies. Cookies received with ads are collected by our advertising company, and we do not have access to this information. Some customer data may be shared with the advertising companies. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to discover your identity and we do not know your identity unless you tell us.</span>

		</p><p><span class="bold">We do not disclose your information to parties outside of our affiliated companies.<br></span>
		<span class="reg">Edina Realty Home Services is a member of a family of companies, which includes HomeServices.com, Iowa Realty, First Realty Better Homes &amp; Gardens, CBS HOME Real Estate, J.C. Nichols Residential, Paul Semonin Realty, Long Realty and their affiliates. We do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise reveal Personal Information or other personally identifiable data about you to parties outside our affiliated companies for their independent use unless: (a) you specifically request or authorize it; (b) the information helps to complete a transaction initiated by you; (c) it is necessary to comply with the law or a good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary to comply with the law; (d) it is to protect and defend our rights; (e) the information is provided to a reputable credit bureau or similar information reporting agency in connection with the completion of your on-line mortgage application; (f) or it is necessary for personal safety (i.e., home security). 

		</span></p><p><span class="bold">Links to other web sites.<br></span>
		<span class="reg">Our web site contains links to and from other web sites and may be in the form of display advertising.

We also are not responsible for the content of web sites other than edinarealty.com.</span>

		</p><p><span class="bold">Opt-in/Opt-out<br></span>
		<span class="reg">Our web site generally requires that if you want us to contact you or provide your Personal Information to outside businesses, you must instruct us to do so ("opt-in"). Otherwise, we will not contact you and your Personal Information will be kept private by us. There are some features on our web site, such as the personalized home search, which will allow us to collect information which allows us to contact you as described in the section "Why we request information about you" above. However, you will have the opportunity to "opt-out" of receiving communications from us and our affiliates at the point where we request information about you. We also provide you with the option of modifying or correcting your information or removing it from our database unless it is required for a transaction initiated by you.<br>
