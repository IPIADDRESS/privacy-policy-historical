                Website Visitors
            </p>
            <p>
                Like most website operators, EditorsDepot collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. EditorsDepot’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how EditorsDepot’s visitors use its website. From time to time, EditorsDepot may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
            </p>
            <p>
                EditorsDepot also collects potentially personally-identifying information like internet protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and people viewing prototype URL’s. EditorsDepot only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

                Personal Information
            </p>
            <p>
                Certain visitors choose to interact with EditorsDepot in ways that require EditorsDepot to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that EditorsDepot gathered depends on the nature of the interaction.
                For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at editorsdepot.com to provide their name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with EditorsDepot — by purchasing access to our premium services or subscriptions for example — are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.
                In each case, EditorsDepot collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with EditorsDepot. Data relating to the transaction carried out through our site and the fulfillment of your orders will be stored. EditorsDepot does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them. Users have the right to data portability. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

                Statistics
            </p>
            <p>
                EditorsDepot may collect statistics about the behavior of the visitors to its website.
                For instance, EditorsDepot may monitor the most popular templates on the editorsdepot.com site to see hur servers perform under the strain or analytics to measure where users spend their time in the platform.
                EditorsDepot may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
                However, EditorsDepot does not disclose personally identifying information other than as described below.
                Additionally, EditorsDepot may monitor a website user's behavior and use that data customize EditorsDepot according to your individual interests.

                Protection of Personal Information
            </p>
            <p>
                EditorsDepot discloses potentially personal information only to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on EditorsDepot’s behalf or to provide services available at EditorsDepot’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using EditorsDepot’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. EditorsDepot will not rent or sell personal information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, EditorsDepot discloses potentially personal information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when EditorsDepot believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property rights of EditorsDepot, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of EditorsDepot and have supplied your email address, EditorsDepot may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with EditorsDepot and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your feedback or to help us support other users.
                EditorsDepot takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personal information. All user data is kept private, except the user's name and avatar, which can be showed if the user has personally submitted a public review of our products.
