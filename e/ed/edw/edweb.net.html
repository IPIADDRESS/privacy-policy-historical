<div id="title">Privacy Policy</div>

<p>Last Updated:  July 29, 2010</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how the edWeb, LLC ("we" or "us") collects, 
protects, uses and shares information about you when you use the edWeb.</p>

<p>The edWeb is a professional networking website for the education community.  When you register 
you are asked for professional information that can help us connect you with other members of 
the education community based on your job function, your educational interests, the kind of 
institution you work in, and your geographic location.  Your profile on the edWeb can be viewed by 
any other member of the edWeb.  Since this is a professional site, this will encourage greater 
collaboration.  Do not include any information in your personal profile that you do not want 
to share with the entire edWeb community.</p>

<p>You can adjust your personal settings to limit who can contact you on the edWeb.  These 
settings can be updated at any time by clicking on "My Settings" on your personal 
member page.</p>

<div class="faqsQuestionContainer">
<div class="faqsQuestion">Your Profile Information</div>
<div class="faqsRule"></div>
<div class="faqsAnswer">
<p>When you register on the edWeb, you create a personal profile that includes your full name, 
title, department, institution, city, state/province, zip/postal code, and country. 
You have the option to add a personal photo, a biography, your educational interests, and 
organizations you are affiliated with.  This information is displayed as your profile information 
to all members of the edWeb.</p>

<p>When you join the edWeb you take a survey of your functions and interests in the educational 
community.  This information helps us connect you with other members of the edWeb who have 
similar roles and interests.  It also helps us place appropriate advertising and messages on 
the pages you view on the site.  Your survey responses are not displayed publicly on the edWeb.</p>

<p>Your user ID (login) is your email address and you create a private password.  Your email 
address is not displayed by the edWeb. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality 
of your password and for all activities that occur under your password.</p>

<p>When you register for the edWeb, you can control which members of the edWeb can contact you: 
contacts and friends, members of your communities, members of selected segments of the 
education community, all members of the edWeb, or no one. You can change these settings at 
any time by going to the "My Settings" link on your personal home page.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faqsQuestionContainer">
<div class="faqsQuestion">Sharing Content on the edWeb</div>
<div class="faqsRule"></div>
<div class="faqsAnswer">
<p>As an edWeb Member, you can share content, such as a blog, photos, and resource files you have 
uploaded. This information will be available to other members of the edWeb if you allow access to 
the information through your privacy settings. You can customize who on the edWeb is allowed access 
to your information.</p>

<p>You can also form edWeb communities to make it easier to share information and resources 
and collaborate with a group of your peers. If you form the community, you are the administrator 
and control the community settings. The administrator is responsible for determining how other 
members of the edWeb may access the community and to what degree the community's discussions, 
blog, files and other content are accessible to other members of the edWeb. A community may be 
public, private or hidden and the content within the community may have a variety of policies 
governing how other members of the site interact with it.</p>

<p>Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to the content of your personal 
and community pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. 
We also cannot control the actions of other members whom you may allow to access your profile. 
Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your information will not be viewed by unauthorized 
persons.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faqsQuestionContainer">
<div class="faqsQuestion">How We Use Your Information</div>
<div class="faqsRule"></div>
<div class="faqsAnswer">
<p>We will not disclose any personally identifiable information about edWeb members except as 
described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>With the exceptions that we explain here, we do not give or sell individual information 
to advertisers. We use aggregated information to help edWeb members connect with other members 
who share common roles, interests, and characteristics.  We also use aggregated information to 
help the advertisers reach the target audience they want to reach. We may also disclose aggregate 
information in order to describe our membership audience and services to prospective partners, 
advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.</p>

<p>The edWeb is created as an advertiser-supported site so we can continue to make edWeb 
services available for free to educators.  It is our intent to provide only education-related 
advertisements that might be of interest to you. We may use information in your profile without 
identifying you individually for the purpose of placing advertisements on pages that you view. 
Our own servers serve all advertisements that appear on the site. The site will not provide 
any personally identifiable information about you to any advertiser on the site.  If you 
click on an advertisement on the edWeb that takes you to third party page, it is your choice 
to provide your personal contact information.</p>

<p>The edWeb uses members' institution information to append additional information from public 
and private sources on school demographic characteristics.  The purpose of this is to help edWeb 
members from schools with similar characteristics or in the same school district to connect with 
one another, and also to enable advertisers to offer more targeted products and services.</p>

<p>We may conduct research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based upon the 
information you provide us or in response to polls/surveys of members. This research would be 
compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.  Your responses are kept anonymous.</p>
 
<p>We may disclose personally identifiable information under the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>When you register for the site, if you have selected the option to receive information from 
edWeb partner organizations, we may provide your name, job function, email address, location, and institution 
contact information to our partner organizations so they can contact you directly.</li>
<li>If you join a community that is hosted by or sponsored by one of our partner organizations, 
we may provide your name, job function, email address, location, and institution contact 
information to that organization so they can contact you directly.</li>
<li>If you send e-mail from the Site, your address will appear as the return address of that e-mail.</li>
<li>If you ask us to put you on our opt-out email list, we will provide this information to our 
authorized service providers so you DO NOT receive additional emails from us.  This is required 
by federal CAN-SPAM legislation.</li>
<li>If we conduct campaigns to invite other members of the education community to join the edWeb, 
we will provide your contact information to our authorized service providers so you DO NOT 
receive duplicate email invitations from us.</li>
<li>We employ subcontractors and service providers who help us develop and maintain the edWeb. 
They have access to our user information, so that they can perform their services for us, 
including maintaining our core engine, hosting services, and performing system maintenance and 
enhancement. These parties are subject to confidentiality agreements that restrict their use and 
disclosure of information they obtain through their relationship with us.</li>
<li>As required by applicable law, or in response to legal process, to protect our rights or 
property, or to protect our safety or the safety of our users or others.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the edWeb may use your personal information to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Contact you by email or phone regarding your membership and activities on the site.</li>
<li>To assist you if you have lost your user ID or need help changing your user ID or password.</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>

<div class="faqsQuestionContainer">
<div class="faqsQuestion">Email Communications</div>
<div class="faqsRule"></div>
<div class="faqsAnswer">
<p>Email communication is an important aspect of the edWeb. When you register for the edWeb you 
give us your permission to use email to send you periodic updates and information and to use 
your email address to send you notifications of activities related to your participation on the 
site.  You can update your permissions at any time in "My Settings" to customize the 
email notifications you receive.  If at any time you are concerned about the volume of email 
you are receiving from the edWeb, please contact us at info@edweb.net.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faqsQuestionContainer">
<div class="faqsQuestion">Cookies and Other Technologies We Use</div>
<div class="faqsRule"></div>
<div class="faqsAnswer">
<p>When we track activity on the edWeb, we collect information such as your IP address, browser 
type and version, and pages you view. We receive an IP address each time you view the Site, 
because our server automatically reports it to us. We may collect your connection information 
including details of IP addresses, operating systems, browsers, versions, and the URLs of web
pages with links which you use to get to the Site
(but not e-mail addresses) as part of our analysis of the site. 
We use this information in our business for various purposes, including diagnosing service or 
technology problems, assessing and maintaining system security, and/or displaying the most 
appropriate advertising messages. We do not track any URLs that you type into your browser that 
are not URLs associated with the site and we do not track you across the Internet once you leave 
our site. We gather this information for all edWeb members. By accessing the site, you 
unconditionally consent to allow us to collect your connection information and use that 
information in accordance with this Privacy Policy for any purpose not prohibited by applicable 
law.</p>

<p>We use "session cookies" to manage your experience on our site. A session cookie is a 
small piece of information we ask your browser to send to us along with each request you make 
to view a page on the edWeb. We use this information so that you can best take advantage of the 
features of the site during your visit. Your browser will no longer send session cookies to 
us either when you close your browser or when you log out. The next time you visit us, 
you will be given new session cookies. This is what differentiates session cookies from 
permanent cookies; permanent cookies are stored on your computer, and your browser will be 
able to send the same information during your visit as was sent during earlier visits. 
We use permanent cookies to understand more fully how members are using the edWeb and how
we can improve it.</p>

<p>When we send you emails, we may use a variety of mechanisms including the use of embedded 
images to determine the number of members who open our emails. These images would also allow 
us to count users who have visited the edWeb and to deliver co-branded services. When you 
click on a link in an email, we may record this individual response to allow us to 
customize our offerings to you. Embedded images may also be used to conduct research on 
behalf of some partners on their websites for auditing purposes and/or to determine aggregate 
information about users, including demographic and usage information. Embedded images are not 
used to access your personally identifiable information, but they are a technique we may use 
to compile aggregated statistics about usage of the edWeb. Embedded images collect only a 
limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, 
originating IP address, and a description of the page on which the embedded images resides. 
If you find our site using a search engine, the search engine and the search term used may 
be transmitted back to our ad-serving service providers via a cookie. This information is 
anonymous and does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. 
This information is used only in the aggregate to evaluate how users reach our site.</p>

<p>In addition, some of our advertisers use third-party networks to serve their advertisements 
on the edWeb. Often, these third-party advertising companies use cookies, web beacons, 
and similar technologies to measure advertisement effectiveness. We do not control, nor do we 
have access to, their cookies or the information they obtain. Use of their tracking technology 
is subject to their own privacy policies.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faqsQuestionContainer">
<div class="faqsQuestion">Security</div>
<div class="faqsRule"></div>
<div class="faqsAnswer">
<p>We believe we take appropriate precautions to protect the personal information submitted to 
us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Certain parts of the site use a secure web 
server, which allows web browser programs to interact with the server via an encrypted 
session using a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection between you and us. Users may move 
in and out of secured areas on the Site. You should be able to identify when you are in a secure 
area by "https" or a lock appearing on the screen. This will depend on the type of 
browser used.</p>

<p>Do not share your password with anyone. We will never ask you for your password. If you are 
using a computer to which others have access, such as one in a computer lab, Internet cafe, 
or public library, always remember to log out and close your browser window when leaving the site.  
Do not save your password on a public or shared computer.</p>

<p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. 
While we strive to use appropriate means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee 
the absolute security of any information you disclose via the edWeb, including via e-mail. 
When disclosing any personal information, you should remain mindful of the fact that it is 
potentially accessible by unauthorized persons. By disclosing any information, you accept 
the inherent security risks of providing information and dealing online over the Internet and 
will not hold us responsible for any breach of security. We disclaim all liability for the 
security of information transmitted through the Internet.</p>

<div class="faqsRule"></div>
<div class="faqsAnswer">
<p>You may invite individuals who are qualified members of the education community to become a 
member of the edWeb and to become a linked "Contact &amp; Friend" of yours. If you are 
the administrator of an edWeb community, you may invite individuals to join your community 
and be added as a linked "Contact &amp; Friend." If you choose to use our invitation 
service for personal or community purposes, we will ask you to enter your colleague's 
email address. We will automatically send an email inviting that individual to join the 
edWeb. We store the email address used to send this invitation so that we can verify that 
the recipient has a valid invitation to join the edWeb and also to register a linked connection 
between you, your community, if applicable, and your contact or friend. We may periodically send 
reminders to individuals who do not reply. We do not use this information for any other purposes.</p>
