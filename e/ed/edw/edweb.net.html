Effective December 17, 2007<br>
<br>
edWeb, LLC ("we" or "us") places the highest importance on respecting and maintaining 
your privacy. We hope the information provided here increases your confidence and the value you 
gain from using the edWeb website (<a href="http://www.edweb.net">www.edweb.net</a>) (the "Site,") and the services provided 
thereon (the "Services"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, protect, use and share 
information about you when you use the Site and/or Services. This Privacy Policy is incorporated 
into and subject to the edWeb <a href="http://www.edweb.net/userAgreement">User Agreement</a>. Each time that you use the Site, you signify that 
you agree to be bound by the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the 
terms of this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the Services and terminate your membership.
<br>
<br>
<div class="faqsQuestionContainer">
<div class="faqsQuestion">Information We Collect</div>
<div class="faqsRule"></div>
<div class="faqsAnswer">
When you visit the edWeb we collect two types of information: personal information you choose to 
disclose when you register or update your user profile, and information collected by us as you 
interact with the Site.
</div>
</div>
<div class="faqsQuestionContainer">
<div class="faqsQuestion">User-Provided Information</div>
<div class="faqsRule"></div>
<div class="faqsAnswer">
We collect personal information from you when you register with our Site, update your profile, 
and use various features of our Site. When you register with the Site, you provide your full name, 
your email address, your job function, title and status, the institution where you work, and the 
city, state/province, zip/postal code, and country of your institution. We do not ask for any 
personal information such as your home address, phone number or any other information about you. 
When you complete our registration form you will be able to access the Site. Once you are 
registered, you have the option to add to your profile a personal photo and additional 
professional information including a brief biography, your areas of interest, and associations 
with whom you maintain affiliations. If you are interested in connecting with other members of 
the site for networking purposes, you also have the opportunity to select those areas from a checklist.
We may also collect information regarding your interaction with other Users and your use of the 
Site. From time to time we may also collect information about you through other methods, including 
information we obtain from third parties, including verification services, data compilers, as well 
as public sources. We use this information to continually offer you the most value as an edWeb member.
<br>
<br>
Each member of the edWeb has a personal home page and associated sub-pages connected to the 
personal home page. The personal home page displays the profile information described above, as 
well as any Content that you have uploaded or added to your personal home page. Your personal 
home page does not display your email address or the networking interests you may have selected 
in your profile. Your email address is not displayed anywhere publicly on the site, unless you 
choose to disclose it in any Content you post. Your networking interests are not displayed 
anywhere on the Site, either. These interests are used in our search functionality to enable 
like-minded members interested in similar topics to meet.
<br>
<br>
By using the permission settings on your profile, you can control which members of the Site have 
access to your personal profile data. By default, these permission settings are set to show your 
profile only to members of the Site who are in your "My Contacts &amp; Friends" list. You can change 
these settings at any time by going to the "My Settings" link in your personal navigation bar. 
You can set your profile to be seen by all members of the Site, only linked "Contacts &amp; Friends," 
or even no one.
<br>
<br>
Please note: the Site is a professional site and does not use screen names or nicknames to hide a 
member's identity. While you have control over who can access your profile and other Content on 
your home page, your full name and profile picture, if you have uploaded a photo, cannot be hidden 
and will always be viewable by all members of the Site when they visit your personal home page, 
when they access the Site's list of members, and when you add Content, such as a discussion or blog 
post, to a public community or the edWeb Forums.
<br>
<br>
Your name and profile picture also will be available to all members of the Site when they use the 
Site's search functionality. This is primarily so your existing contacts and friends can find you 
and send a request to become a linked connection of yours on the Site. Members of the Site can also 
use the search function to find other members who share similar networking interests. However, 
members who see your name in search results will not be able to read your profile information unless 
they have a relationship with you (i.e. they are a linked Contact &amp; Friend) or your privacy settings 
allow all members of the edWeb to access your profile. 
<br>
<br>
As an edWeb Member, you can share personal Content, such as a blog, files you have uploaded and 
multimedia such as photos. Please be aware that by using any of these features, your personally 
identifiable information may be accessible to other members of the edWeb, and we have no control 
over how other members may use your personally identifiable information.
<br>
<br>
Profile information you submit to the Site and Content you post to your personal home page and 
sub-pages will be available to other members of the Site you allow to access the information 
through your privacy settings. You may set your privacy settings to allow all members of the edWeb 
to access your profile, only linked Contacts &amp; Friends, or no one.  These permissions are set 
within each of the tools provided on the personal home page. To protect 
your privacy, we recommend that you choose your profile and Content viewing preferences with care. 
We also recommend that you avoid posting personal or private information in discussions, on forums 
or blogs, or in any files you choose to upload and share with other members, as any information you 
provide may be viewable by other members of the Site and authorized edWeb staff.
</div>
</div>
<div class="faqsQuestionContainer">
<div class="faqsQuestion">Security of Your Personal Information on the edWeb</div>
<div class="faqsRule"></div>
<div class="faqsAnswer">
Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your profile and the Content of 
your personal home and sub-pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or 
impenetrable. We also cannot control the actions of other members whom you may allow to access 
your profile. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your profile will not be viewed by 
unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or 
security measures contained on the Site. 
</div>
</div>
<div class="faqsQuestionContainer">
<div class="faqsQuestion">Cookies and Other Technologies We Use</div>
<div class="faqsRule"></div>
<div class="faqsAnswer">
When we track activity on the edWeb, we collect information such as your IP address, browser 
type and version, and pages you view. We receive an IP address each time you view the Site, 
because our server automatically reports it to us. We may collect your connection information 
including details of IP addresses, operating systems, browsers, versions, and the website that 
you visited prior to the Site (but not e-mail addresses) as part of our analysis of the Site. We 
would use this information in our business for various purposes, including diagnosing service or 
technology problems, assessing and maintaining system security, and/or displaying the most 
appropriate advertising or content.  We do not track any URLs that you type into your browser 
that are not URLs associated with the Site and we do not track you across the Internet once you 
leave our Site. We gather this information for all edWeb members. By accessing the Site, you 
unconditionally consent to allow us to collect your connection information and use that 
information in accordance with this Privacy Policy for any purpose not prohibited by applicable law.
<br>
<br>
We use "session cookies" to manage your experience on our Site. A session cookie is a small 
piece of information we ask your browser to send to us along with each request you make to view 
a page on our Site.  We use this information so that you can best take advantage of the features 
of the Site during your visit.  Your browser will no longer send session cookies to us either 
when you close your browser or when you log out.  The next time you visit us, you will be given 
new session cookies.  This is what differentiates session cookies from permanent cookies; 
permanent cookies are stored on your computer, and your browser will be able to send the same 
information during your visit as was sent during earlier visits.  We do not use permanent cookies.  
<br>
<br>
Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can configure yours to refuse cookies or 
notify you when you've received one.  Browsers differ, so check your "Help" menu to learn how to 
change your cookie preferences.  However, if you reject cookies on the Site, you may not be able 
to access all areas of the Site or use some of its features.
<br>
<br>
When we send you emails, we may use a variety of mechanisms including the use of embedded images 
to determine the number of members who open our emails. These images would also allow us to count 
users who have visited the Site and to deliver co-branded services. When you click on a link in 
an email, we may record this individual response to allow us to customize our offerings to you.  
Embedded images may also be used to conduct research on behalf of some partners on their websites 
for auditing purposes and/or to determine aggregate information about users, including demographic 
and usage information. Embedded images are not used to access your personally identifiable 
information, but they are a technique we may use to compile aggregated statistics about usage 
of the Site. Embedded images collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, 
time and date of a page view, originating IP address, and a description of the page on which the 
embedded images resides.  If you find our Site using a search engine, the search engine and the search term used may be 
transmitted back to our ad-serving service providers via a cookie. This information is anonymous 
and does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. This information is 
used only in the aggregate to evaluate how users reach our site.
<br>
<br>
In addition, some of our advertisers use third-party networks to serve their advertisements on 
the Site. Often, these third-party advertising companies use cookies, web beacons, and similar 
technologies to measure advertisement effectiveness. We do not control, nor do we have access to, 
their cookies or the information they obtain. Use of their tracking technology is subject to 
their own privacy policies.

<div class="faqsQuestionContainer">
<div class="faqsQuestion">Communities and the edWeb Forums</div>
<div class="faqsRule"></div>
<div class="faqsAnswer">
Members should be aware that Content they submit to edWeb communities is governed by a different set of 
permissions. On your personal home page, you can decide who may access your profile and your 
Content. In communities you belong to, permissions about who may belong to the community, and who may 
read, access and post to the community are determined by the community's administrator. All Content that 
individual members add to a community include the member's full name as well as a profile picture if 
the member has uploaded a photo to his or her profile. The administrator of each community formed on 
the edWeb is fully responsible for determining how other members of the edWeb may access the community 
and to what degree the community's discussions, blog, files and other Content are accessible to other 
members of the edWeb. A community may be public, private or hidden and the Content within the community 
may have a variety of policies governing how other members of the Site interact with it. 
<br>
<br>
Individual members should make themselves aware of a community's policies before posting Content to 
that community. Just as individuals bear full responsibility for their personal home page and 
sub-pages and how other members of the Site can access those pages, the community administrator for 
each community, and not us, is responsible for how content is displayed and accessible to other 
members of the edWeb within that particular community and for all activity that occurs within each 
community. Members of the edWeb should be aware that it is possible for a community that is marked as 
private or hidden to become public if the administrator of the community changes the community's access policy.
<br>
<br>
The edWeb Forums are public forums available to all members of the edWeb. Unlike your personal 
home page or a private or hidden community you may belong to, the Forums are a public space on the 
Site. Your name, photo, if you've uploaded one, and any posts you make to these Forums are 
accessible to all members of the edWeb.  As such, any personal information you disclose in these 
Forums can be collected and used by others, so it is important for you to exercise discretion and 
appropriate caution when deciding to reveal personal information in these areas.
</div>
</div>
<div class="faqsQuestionContainer">
<div class="faqsQuestion">User Content</div>
<div class="faqsRule"></div>
<div class="faqsAnswer">
When you add Content to the Site, you do so at your own risk. Although we allow you to set 
privacy options that limit access to your personal home page and sub-pages, please be aware that 
no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. 
<br>
<br>
We cannot control the actions of other members with whom you may choose to share your pages and 
information. We also cannot control how your Content may be viewed or accessed in a community that you 
have posted your Content to or that other members have posted your Content to. Therefore, we 
cannot and do not guarantee that your Content will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are 
not responsible for the failure or circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures 
contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of Content 
may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other members have copied or stored your Content.
</div>
</div>
<div class="faqsQuestionContainer">
<div class="faqsQuestion">How We Use Your Information</div>
<div class="faqsRule"></div>
<div class="faqsAnswer">
We will not disclose any personally identifiable information about individual users, except 
as described in this Privacy Policy. With the few exceptions that we explain here, we do not 
give or sell individual information to our advertisers, although we may provide aggregate 
information. We may also use this aggregated information to help the advertisers reach the kind 
of audience they want. We may also disclose aggregate information (for example, information 
showing that a certain number of our members clicked on a particular advertising banner last 
month) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third 
parties, and for other lawful purposes.
<br>
<br>
As for individually identifiable information, we may disclose it only under the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>We may disclose information to others when we have your consent.</li>
<li>If you sign up for a special offer from an advertiser, we will provide your individual contact 
information (for example, name, mailing address, e-mail address, and/or telephone number), so that 
the advertiser or its agent can fulfill the special offer. Once the advertiser receives the 
information, it will handle the information under its own privacy policies. Obviously, if you do 
not want a particular advertiser to have your personal information, then you should not sign up 
for that advertiser's offer.</li>
<li>If you send e-mail from the Site, your address will appear as the return address of that e-mail</li>
<li>We may disclose your personal information as required by applicable law, or in response to 
legal process, to protect our rights or property, or to protect our safety or the safety of our 
users or others.</li>
<li>We may sometimes conduct mailings to other people's lists. To make it easier for us to comply 
with the federal law, we may share our e-mail list of people who have requested not to receive 
promotional communications from us with the list providers (or contractors) solely so that we can 
avoid sending e-mails to people who have asked not to receive them (or, conversely, so that our 
advertisers can avoid sending e-mails to people who have requested not to hear from them). We 
would provide these lists only to list providers or contractors that we consider to be reputable, 
and only under strict nondisclosure/nonuse agreements.</li>
<li>We may disclose personal information in some other limited circumstances, but we would 
specifically describe them to you when we collect the information, such as in the rules of a 
contest or a new service. For example, if we were to give personal information to a contest's sponsor, we would disclose it when you sign up for the contest, so that you can decide whether to enter.</li>
<li>In developing our business, we might sell certain assets or the company, or parts of it, may 
be sold, merged or otherwise transferred. In such transactions, user information, whether personally 
identifiable or otherwise, may be one of the transferred assets.  We will notify users of the 
Site of such a change in ownership or transfer of assets by posting a notice on the Site.</li>
<li>We may employ contractors or other third parties to help with our operations. We may give 
them access to databases of user information, so that they can perform their services for us, 
including performing system maintenance, performing list analysis or management, or sending 
mailings for us from our advertisers. These parties would all be subject to confidentiality 
agreements that restrict their use and disclosure of information they obtain through their 
relationship with us.</li>
<li>Our ad server delivers the ads appearing on the Site to you. Information such as the number 
of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information) is used 
to serve ads to you.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
We may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third 
parties. We do this for purposes of personalizing advertisements and promotions so that we can 
provide you with the best possible experience while using the Site and our Services. The Site is 
an advertising-supported site and it is our intent to provide only advertisements that are useful 
to you. We use the information you provide in your profile to tailor advertisements to you. We 
believe this benefits you because you will see advertisements for products that are of interest 
to you. Without advertising, we would not be able to offer the Site to our members as a free 
service. Our own servers serve all advertisements that appear on the Site and in emails we may 
send to you. At no time does the Site ever provide any personally identifiable information about 
you to any advertiser on the Site.
<br>
<br>
We may conduct research on our Users' demographics, interests, and behavior based upon the 
information you provide us when you participate in contests or other promotions on the Site, 
or based upon the information on our server log files. This research would be compiled and 
analyzed on an aggregated basis. We may also notify you of products, services, or areas of the 
Site that we think may interest you based on the information we've received. If you would prefer 
us not to contact you for these purposes, just send us an e-mail at info@edweb.net and let us know.
<br>
<br>
We may use your registration information in the event we need to contact you regarding your 
profile, postings or other community activities or to inquire about your edWeb experience. 
Please see a detailed explanation of how email is used on the Site below.
<br>
<br>
We collect search information that you enter in the Site to help us determine what our Users 
are interested in and to give us ideas for new content on the Site. This information is anonymous 
and used in the aggregate.
<br>
<br>
In addition, we may use your personal information to:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>maintain internal records and for other internal administrative purposes;</li>
<li>compile statistical analysis of the Site for security and administrative purposes;</li>
<li>help us assess and develop our services to help serve you better including informing you of 
new services, alliances and other information which may be relevant to you (unless you have asked 
us not to); and</li>
<li>create an individual profile for you so that we can inform you of particular goods, services 
or events that may be of interest to you and to display that information according to your 
preferences.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
We are under no obligation to verify the source of personal information provided about you, and 
will consider such information to have been provided or authorized by you.

</div>
<div class="faqsQuestionContainer">
<div class="faqsQuestion">Email</div>
<div class="faqsRule"></div>
<div class="faqsAnswer">
Email communication is an important aspect of the Site and Service. We may use your personal 
information to send you emails for the following reasons:
<br>
<br>
<div class="opUnderline">Service Related Emails</div>
<ul>
<li>We may send you service-related announcements such as a Welcome Email, regular updates on 
new features on the site, or other information you may need to better utilize the Site and its 
Services, from time to time.</li>
<li>We may also send you newsletters from time to time. You may change your newsletter 
preferences (i) at any time by simply updating your account or (ii) by opting-out of receiving 
future newsletters as described at the bottom of each communication from us.</li>

</ul>
<br>
<br>
<div class="opUnderline">Transactional Emails</div>
We will send you certain emails to alert you to communication on the Site, invitations you've 
received, or other transactions that require a response from you. Some examples of transactional 
emails you will receive include:
<ul>
<li>When you join the site for the first time, you'll receive a Welcome Email from us with your 
password and information on getting the most out of your use of the Site;</li>
<li>When a member of the Site sends you a private message, you'll receive an email alerting you 
that you have a message waiting on the Site;</li>
<li>When a Member invites you to become a linked "Contact &amp; Friend," you'll receive an email 
letting you know that you need to go to your home page to approve or deny the invitation;</li>
<li>When a Community invites you to become a member, you'll receive an email alerting you to 
the invitation and the action you need to take to join the community.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<div class="opUnderline">Notifications of Activity on the Site</div>
Keeping our members alerted to the presence of new content on the edWeb is one of the most 
important aspects of our Service. Members receive email notifications about all new content 
that has been posted on the personal home pages of anyone in your Contacts &amp; Friends list or 
in Communities of which you are a member. 
<br>
<br>
Examples of new content you may be notified about in an email notification may include: a new 
blog entry or a comment to a blog; a new community or personal discussion topic and all the responses 
to that topic; a new community blog entry or comments; a file upload such as a photograph and comments 
added; a new discussion topic and responses in the Forums section.
<br>
<br>
For each member of your Contacts &amp; Friends list, for each community you belong to, and for the edWeb 
Forums, you have the option to decide how you wish to be notified. By default, you will receive 
an email with the full text of new content or an email with a link to the new content but you 
have the option to change this for every one of your linked connections on the Site. From the 
personal home page, follow the link to My Settings&gt;Subscriptions. Here you may choose to be 
alerted every time new content is added, receive an email digest of all new content once a day, 
or not to be alerted at all. Notifications of new activity may also appear on the your personal 
home page in the sections labeled  "Activity in Your Contacts &amp; Friends' Spaces" and "Activity 
in Your Communities." 
<br>
<br>
We reserve the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary
email notifications.
</div>
</div>
<div class="faqsQuestionContainer">
<div class="faqsQuestion">Security</div>
<div class="faqsRule"></div>
<div class="faqsAnswer">
The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted 
industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission 
and once we receive it. Certain parts of the Site use a secure web server, which allows web 
browser programs to interact with the server via an encrypted session using a Secure Sockets 
Layer (SSL) connection between you and us.  Users may move in and out of secured areas on the 
Site.  You should be able to identify when you are in a secure area by "https" or a lock 
appearing on the screen.  This will depend on the type of browser used.
<br>
<br>
Do not share your password with anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an 
unsolicited phone call or e-mail. If you are using a computer to which others have access, 
such as one in a computer lab, Internet cafe, or public library, always remember to log out and 
close your browser window when leaving the Site.
<br>
<br>
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. 
While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we 
cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information you disclose via the Site, including

Personal information about children is a concern for all of us, and we take the protection of 
children's privacy very seriously. The Site is not directed at children under the age of 18, and 
we do not encourage participation or visitation by children of any age. We operate the Site in 
compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and will not knowingly collect, 
solicit or use personal information from anyone under the age of 18 or allow such persons to 
become members of the edWeb. If you are under 18, please do not attempt to register as a member
or send any information about yourself to us. In the event that we learn that we have collected 
personal information from someone under the age of 18, we will delete that information as 
quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about someone 
under 18, please alert us through our <a href="http://www.edweb.net/contact">Contact Us</a> form.

Occasionally we conduct surveys to better target our content to our audience or for the benefit 
of third parties with whom we do business. When we do so, we will let you know how we intend to 
use the information collected from the survey.  Sometimes the aggregate survey results are shared 
with our advertisers and partners. We never share any survey information about specific response 
with any third party unless that individual consents.  If you are not satisfied with the reasons 
for the survey, you may refrain from contributing to it.

<div class="faqsQuestion">Links to Other Web Sites and Third Party Relationships</div>
<div class="faqsRule"></div>
<div class="faqsAnswer"></div>
The Site may contain links to third-party web sites not operated by us. Links to other websites 
are provided solely as a convenience to you.  It is possible for you to receive information 
directly from our partners and other companies if you access them through a link on the Site or 
if you go directly to their web sites. If you follow links from the Site to others, you should be 
aware that you are doing business with those other sites, which have their own privacy and data 
collection practices. This Privacy Policy only applies to the Site and the information we collect. 
We do not monitor those other websites nor do we have any control or responsibility for them, 
their content or their privacy policies. Consequently, we neither endorse nor make any 
representations about them, nor the privacy policies of those sites.  We have no responsibility 
or liability for these independent policies (and we may not even know what they are). For more 
information regarding a site and its privacy policies, check that site. For additional 
information about links to third-party sites, please review our 
<a href="http://www.edweb.net/userAgreement">User Agreement</a>.
<br>
<br>
We have relationships with third parties to assist us in providing the Site and Service. These 
service providers act on our behalf and are contractually required to maintain the 
confidentiality of the information we provide them. For example, we may use service providers 
to host our Site and our Services. Service providers who host web pages and collect information 
on our behalf are strictly prohibited from using your information for their own purpose. Our 
contracts restrict service providers to use the personal information we disclose to them only 
to provide you the service you have requested.
<br>
<br>
While we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the 
security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. You are 
responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any password and/or account information. Please be 
careful and responsible whenever you are online, especially when using a computer that other 
people can use also.
