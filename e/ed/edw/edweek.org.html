			<p>Effective Date: September 30, 2004</p>
			<p>The following policy governs edweek.org's online collection of information from you. Specifically, it outlines the types of information that edweek.org gathers about you while you are using this website, and the way that edweek.org uses and doesn't use this information. This Privacy Statement does not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or through other means; for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail.</p>
			<h2>PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF CHILDREN</h2>
			<p>Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. Our website is not directed at children under 13 and we won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information; if you're under 13, please don't provide any information about yourself on this website.</p>
			<h2>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
			<p>The information that edweek.org collects about visitors while they are using this website falls into two general categories:</p>
			<p><strong>Information You Provide to Us.</strong>  edweek.org may collect and store information that you voluntarily supply either while on the edweek.org website or in responding, via e-mail to a feature provided on the edweek.org website. Examples of this type of information include: information that you electronically submit when you register on the edweek.org website, information that you post on message boards on the edweek.org website, information submitted to edweek.org’s online calendar, and information contained in search requests or questions that you submit to the edweek.org website. If you decline to supply or provide edweek.org with certain information while using this Web site, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through this Web site.</p>
			<p><strong>Information that is Automatically Collected.</strong> edweek.org also collects and stores information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the edweek.org website. For example, to enhance your experience on the edweek.org website,edweek.org uses a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie." Cookies are small files that we place on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the edweek.org site, cookies help us track user trends and patterns. Cookies make your experience easier by saving your preferences and passwords. We also use cookies that contain no personal information at all. These cookies help us estimate our audience size, determine which areas of edweek.org are the most popular, and serve targeted advertising. Our advertisers and those who provide products and/or services through our site may also assign their own cookies, a process we don't control. We don't have access to these cookies or to any information they contain. Many browsers are set to accept cookies. You may prefer to set your browser to refuse cookies. It is possible, however, that some areas of this website will not function properly if you do so.</p>
			<p>edweek.org also uses Web beacons (also known as "single-pixel GIFs") to count users who visit the edweek.org site. This information allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our Web pages to you and to measure traffic on the edweek.org site.</p>
			<p>We automatically collect limited information about your computer configuration when you visit our site, including the type of browser software you use, the operating system you're running, the resolution of your computer monitor, the website that referred you, and your IP address. (Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you want to view) can be transmitted to you. We also use IP address information for systems administration and trouble shooting purposes. Your IP address does not tell us who you are.) We use this information to make our site as useful as we can for as many users as possible.</p>
			<h2>USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h2>
			<p>edweek.org uses the information it collects from you while you are using this website in a variety of ways, including marketing of our own products to you or for sending messages on behalf of other organizations.

We review our users' preferences, demographics, traffic patterns, and other information so that we can better understand our audience and what they want. Tracking user preferences also helps us serve you more relevant advertising. We may also sell your name and mailing address (but not your e-mail address) to third parties.</p>
			<p><b>Ad Serving.</b> We use a third party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our site. This company may use certain information (not including your name, address, e-mail or telephone number) about your visits to our and other Web sites, in combination with non-personally identifiable information about your purchases and interests from other online of offline sources, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. In addition, we share Web usage information about visitors to our sites with this company for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements and for market research analysis on our site and other sites. For these purposes, we and out third-party advertising company may note some of the pages you visit on our site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your computer.

			<p><b>Information Disclosed in Public Areas.</b> You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal information online in a public area of the edweek.org site, such as on message boards, or in chat areas, that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides edweek.org. edweek.org cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third party use of information that you disclose in a public area on the edweek.org site.</p>
			<p><b>Vendors and Service Providers.</b> To make our site more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some features in conjunction with other providers (“Provider Partners”). Our message boards and e-mail newsletters, for example, may be made available through cooperative arrangements with providers that specialize in operating such services. In some instances, our Provider Partners will have the same access to your information as we do. Their use of the information will be subject to the terms of their respective privacy policies, which you can find on their websites.</p>
			<p><b>Links And Features Offered In Conjunction With Other Providers.</b> The edweek.org website includes links to other websites, and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control.

			<p>Transmission of personal information to our servers, and from our servers to our Provider Partners’ servers, uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to encrypt the information during transmission. All information gathered on edweek.org is stored within a controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is accessible only to authorized personnel. In addition, edweek.org stores credit card information and passwords in an encrypted, non-human readable format. Although, we use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of our servers or databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.</p>
