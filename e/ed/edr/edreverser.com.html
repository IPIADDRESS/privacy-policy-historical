The ED Reverser System is  not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third  web sites or applications. </p>
  <p><strong>1. Collection of  Information.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>1.1 Survey  Information.</strong></p>
  <p>The ED Reverser System  collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not  limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a The ED Reverser System survey,  order form, or a registration&nbsp;<span id="2a78864b-1f8c-4cde-ae5b-59e76dad1f85">pages</span>&nbsp;either online or offline, or by  means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated  by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein,  "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and  related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online,  including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and  other similar means.) In the Surveys, The ED Reverser System or a third party (a  "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information  to The ED Reverser System , which may include his or her name, email address, street  address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and  carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status,  occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online  interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time  (together, "Survey Information"). The ED Reverser System may also collect  information concerning an individual from another source and uses that  information in combination with information provided from this web site.  Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no  obligation to provide Survey Information to The ED Reverser System or Third Party, but  an individual may receive incentives from The ED Reverser System or a Third Party in  exchange for providing Survey Information to The ED Reverser System.  </p>
  <p><strong>1.2 Other Information.</strong></p>
  <p>Other occasions when  The ED Reverser System obtains information from individuals include (1) when an  individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive  offered by The ED Reverser System or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests  assistance through The ED Reverser System's customer service department, and (3) when  an individual voluntarily subscribes to a The ED Reverser System service or newsletter  (together, "Other Information"). </p>
  <p><strong>1.3 Cookies, Web  Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</strong></p>
  <p>The ED Reverser System  currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain  Internet-related information about an individual with information about the  individual in our database. Additionally, The ED Reverser System may use other new and  evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology  Information"). </p>
  <p><strong>(a) Cookies.</strong></p>
  <p>A cookie is a small  amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that  allows The ED Reverser System to identify the individual with his or her corresponding  data that resides in The ED Reverser System's database. You may read more about cookies  at <a href="http://cookiecentral.com/" target="_blank">http://cookiecentral.com</a>. Individuals who use the Websites need to  accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the  Websites. </p>
  <p><strong>(b) Web Beacons.</strong></p>
  <p>A web beacon is  programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using&nbsp;an&nbsp;programming  function -- see <a href="http://truste.org/" target="_blank">http://truste.org</a>&nbsp;for more information), but can also be  used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form  of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously  acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows The ED Reverser System to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are  used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and  to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, The ED Reverser System might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on  the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Bill, an  individual listed in The ED Reverser System's database, visits the fishing website,  The ED Reverser System receives notice by means of the web beacon that Bill visited the  fishing site, and The ED Reverser System would then update Bill's profile with the  information that Bill is interested in fishing. The ED Reverser System may thereafter  present offers of fishing related products and services to Bill. In addition to  using web beacons on web pages, The ED Reverser System also uses web beacons in email  messages sent to individuals listed in The ED Reverser System's database. </p>
  <p><strong>(c) New Technology.</strong></p>
  <p>The use of technology  on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is  The ED Reverser System's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, The ED Reverser System strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates  regarding its use of technology.  </p>
  <p><strong>1.4 Individual  Information.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>1.5 No Information  Collected from Children.</strong></p>
  <p>The ED Reverser System will  never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age  of 13. If The ED Reverser System obtains actual knowledge that it has collected  personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will  be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such  information, The ED Reverser System has no such information to use or to disclose to  third parties. The ED Reverser System has designed this policy in order to comply with the  Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). </p>
