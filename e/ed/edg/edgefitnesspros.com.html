In any such e-mail from us, we will provide a way for you to “opt out” or choose to decline to receive promotional e-mail from us. We may occasionally find a third-party offer in which we believe you might be interested and may send you information, but we will not provide your e-mail address to the third party.</p>
<p>We may also offer various surveys on the site. If the survey is a news survey or about service satisfaction, we will not share that information. Certain other surveys and contests are promotional in nature, and are often sponsored by or hosted and run by our advertisers.</p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads and collect data when you visit our Web site.

<p>In such cases, we disclose that we collect and may share the information you provide to enter the contest or complete the survey with the advertiser. Of course, you will always have the choice of whether to enter the contest or complete such a survey, and therefore you will control the decision about sharing your information.</p>

<p>We do not routinely disclose any of our individual reader information to third parties. We may disclose this information in special cases when we have reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights or property of maptofitness.com or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose information to third parties when we believe in good faith that we are required by law to do so, or as otherwise provided in the Site’s Terms of Use.</p>

<p>A last word on internet privacy:</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online – for example in the forums, through email, or in chat areas – that information can be collected and used by others.

Please provide a link. Cutting and pasting of outside content is limited to three sentences. Any more than three, the whole post will be deleted. Also, to keep the discussion and dialogue moving, please keep posts to a reasonable length. Excessively long posts will be deleted. If you have that much to say, talk to us about a blog piece.</p>
