<p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY – Updated as of January 2012</strong></p>
<p>CFNYFM respects your privacy and believes the best way to serve you on the Internet is with honesty, accountability and adherence to legal standards. We are sensitive to the issue of privacy and have structured our online activities to maximize your control over the disclosure of your own personally identifiable information. This website (the "Site") is for information purposes only and the Terms of Use and this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) relate specifically to this Site and do not apply to websites operated by other Corus Entertainment companies, or other third parties, each of which has its own terms of use and privacy policies. Please read the respective sites' terms and policies when accessing those sites.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy Statement supplements our general Terms of Service, which you must also read. By using the Site, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy and by the Terms of Service We may change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting revisions to the Site, and your continued use of the Site indicates your agreement to the revised terms. Accordingly, you should check the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy from time to time to keep informed of such amendments, and, if you do not agree to the terms of this or any revised policy, please do not register as a user or deregister as a user and exit the Site immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy of Children</strong></p>
<p>CFNYFM encourages parents and guardians to be aware of and participate in their children's online activities. Minors (persons under the age of majority in their province or territory of residence) may not use the Site unsupervised and we ask that you do not allow your child to submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect the personal information of minors beyond what is allowed under the Canadian Marketing Association's Code of Ethics &amp; Standards of Practice as they relate to marketing to children on the Internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types of Information collected</strong></p>
<p>CFNYFM may collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and aggregated non-personally identifiable information. Personally Identifiable Information will include information such as your name, Site user name, address, postal code, telephone number, e-mail address, age, marital status, income level, education level, intentions, preferences and opinions. CFNYFM does not collect personally identifiable information about an individual except when individuals provide such specific information on a voluntary basis. Aggregated information will include information that is anonymous such as the type of browser you are using or other such non-personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We may also collect information about you from a social network site you may have connected from, in order to provide you with a more personalized experience. If you send an e-mail to us, or fill out our "feedback" form through the Site, we will collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files, and other information you provide. We may use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through the Site or the social network from which you have connected to the Site (such as in an invitation, or when sharing your content).</p>
<p><strong>Why is the Information Collected?</strong></p>
<p>In order to access some specific features of the Site, you may be required to register or otherwise voluntarily provide personally identifiable information. For example, registration is needed to enter certain contests and better serve your specific interests. You may choose not to provide the personal information, but this may lead to decreased functionality of the Site for you and will prevent us from providing you with certain products or services. However, you can still access and visit many of the Site's features. We also may request you to voluntarily provide personal information that is not required to access features of the Site. This information enables CFNYFM to make general improvements to the Site, ensures that content standards of these sections are rigorously upheld, enables us to contact the prize winners and better serve your specific interests.</p>
<p>CFNYFM may transparently collect non-personally identifiable aggregate information through the use of cookies or by other means. We use this information to assess general usage patterns, including identifying repeat users, collect demographic information, administer and make improvements to the Site to tailor our visitor's experiences at the Site and display content according to their preferences so as to make it more useful to you and other users. CFNYFM, its parent company and its subsidiary and holding companies, our business partners,reserve the right to use, maintain, update, disclose and/or sell aggregate information to third parties.</p>
<p><strong>What We Will and Will Not Do With the Information You Provide</strong></p>
<p>CFNYFM uses information generally to compile statistical data, keep in contact with users and provide them with a better interactive experience. CFNYFM may use your information specifically for the following purposes: (i) to improve the content of our Site; (ii) to personalize and/or customize the content and/or layout of our Site for each individual visitor; (iii) to notify visitors about updates to our Site; (iv) to identify our visitors' preferences; (v) to keep you informed about product and services (both ours and third parties') in which you have expressed an interest; (vi) to establish your eligibility for special offers and discounts; (vii) to complete business transactions; (viii) to contact you as part of a promotion; (ix) to allow you to make a posting on the Site; (x) to administer individual accounts; (xi) to provide customer support; (xii) to meet legal requirements; (xiii) to provide Internet security; and/or (xiv) to analyze the collected information. If you have entered and won one of CFNYFM's contests, CFNYFM and / or its sponsors may publish your name and city of residence.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the event that we sell a substantial portion of our business assets, our customer information may be among the transferred assets. In such event, the purchaser will inherit the confidentiality obligations posted herein.</p>
<p>CFNYFM works closely with a number of parties who may perform functions on our behalf, including fulfilling orders, providing music streaming services or other third party content, providing promotional materials to our users, sending e-mail, managing, compiling and processing data, processing credit card payments or providing customer service. We do not disclose your personally identifiable information to these parties except to the extent necessary to enable them to provide the specific services to you or on your behalf. Other than for the specific purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy Statement, we will not disclose your personal information to any third parties unless we obtain your prior consent or are legally compelled to do so or to protect and defend our rights or property, you or third parties. You hereby consent to us sharing your Personal Information under the circumstances described herein. In addition, we will not contact you without your permission except as specified above or in connection with the registration process. On the Site, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of receiving e-mails, promotional and/or marketing information about other products, services and offerings from CFNYFM and/or any third parties or other information from CFNYFM. Please indicate your preferences on the Site accordingly, by checking the appropriate boxes. If you have questions about how your personal information is used, please contact us.</p>
<p>On the Site, you will be given the opportunity to indicate whether you would like to receive emails, promotional and/or marketing information about other products, services and offerings from CFNYFM and/or any third parties or other information from CFNYFM. You will always have the opportunity to opt-out of any feature that you have opted into on our Site.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable aggregated information we compile about your visits to this Site in order to provide advertisements on this Site about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Neither CFNYFM nor any third parties will make any attempt to link this anonymous aggregated traffic and other information to the individual visiting our Site. Except as otherwise detailed in this Privacy Policy, information that personally identifies you will be kept strictly confidential. Any third party promotions and offers will only be made available through us on behalf of the third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Site, we or a third-party advertiser may store or recognize some information on your computer in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. "Cookies" are small text files that identify an individual computer's browser entering the Site. They do not pose a security threat to you. No personal information is stored within the cookies. For example, cookies allow us to track a browser's movement through the Site over several sessions. Through cookies, the Site can recognize repeat visitors, facilitate the visitor's access to and use of the Site and allows the Site to track usage behaviour that will allow content improvement and enable us to tailor our Site to better match your interests and preferences. If you do not want cookies placed on your computer, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Most Internet browsers or other software will allow you to do this. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. If you reject cookies, functionality of the Site may be severely limited, and you may not be able to take advantage of many of the Site's best features.</p>
<p><strong>About Our Forums</strong></p>
<p>The Site may, from time-to-time, feature forums (such as message boards and chat rooms) which enable our users to communicate with each other.
