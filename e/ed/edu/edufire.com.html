  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>This web site is owned and operated by Education Revolution (“we”, “our”, or “us” or the “Company”). We understand you value your privacy. We want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. This privacy policy (the “Policy”) governs information you provide to us or we learn from your use of this web site (the “Site”) and tells you how we may collect, use, and in some instances share this information. Our policies may differ from other service offerings and you should carefully review the terms of service and this privacy notice before using these services.</p>

  <h2>Collected Information</h2>
  <p>In general, you can visit the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. If you choose to register, and are 13 years of age or older, we will collect your name, date of birth, email address, and street address along with other information you may choose to submit, and you will choose a password as part of the registration process (“Personal Information”). Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, your name, home address, telephone number, and e-mail address.  If you conduct a transaction on or through our Site we will also ask you for additional information including the credit card number and expiration date, billing address, shipping address, name on the account and telephone numbers for the billing and shipping addresses (“Credit Card Information”). By providing your Personal Information to us, you explicitly agree to our collection and use of such information as described in this Policy.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>We are committed to protecting children's privacy online and meeting the requirements of the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. This Site is intended for users above the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. </p>

  <h2>Billing</h2>
  <p>If you use or provide services on the Site for which we implement a billing system for you, we will collect additional information from you so that we can process and collect billing information. For example, we may collect your mailing address to remit payments, and we may collect your Social Security number if necessary and to help us verify your identity. </p>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>The Site uses software tags called "cookies" to identify customers when they visit our Site. Cookies are used to remember user preferences and maximize performance of our services. The information we collect with cookies is not sold, rented, or shared with any outside parties. Users who disable their Web browser's ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Site but will not be able to successfully use our Service. </p>

  <p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site.</p>

  <p>This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by our Site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. </p><p>

  </p><p>Third Party Cookies: We may from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to our Site to help us administer our Site and improve its quality.

All data collected by such third parties on our behalf is used only to provide us with information on Site usage and is not shared with any other third parties.</p>

  <h2>Web Beacons</h2>

  • We use web beacons within the Site in order to count users and to recognize users by accessing our cookies. 
  <br>• Being able to access our cookies allows us to personalize your user experience.
  <br>• In general, any file served as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. We may also include web beacons from other companies within pages we serve so that our advertisers may receive auditing, and reporting. </p><p>

  </p><h2>Log Files</h2>
  <p>We maintain log files of the traffic that visits our Site. We do not link any information gathered in these log files to Personal Information. Log files are used to manage traffic loads and information technology requirements for providing reliable service. Information collected includes IP addresses and browser types.</p><p> 

  </p><h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We take steps to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
