<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy (hereinafter “Policy”) governs your use of the Site. This Policy describes much of the information that we collect from you and what may happen to that information.&nbsp;For example, this Policy is intended to let you know about information we collect from you; what cookies are and how they may be used; how your information is often used; who is collecting your information; with whom your information may be shared; what options are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information; how you may use other users’ information; the types of security precautions in place to protect against loss, misuse, or alteration of your information; how EducationDynamics protects children’s privacy; and other important information about your online privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that we review our privacy practices from time to time, and that our practices are subject to change.&nbsp;We ask that you bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version of our Privacy Policy.&nbsp;All amended terms shall be automatically effective after they are posted on the Site and applied retroactively if you use the Site after this Policy is amended.</p>
<p>By visiting the Site, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use or access the Site.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What Personally Identifiable Information does EducationDynamics collect?</b></p>
<p>A primary purpose of collecting information from you is to provide you with a safe, smooth, effective, and personalized experience.&nbsp;We will only collect information about you that we consider necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, EducationDynamics collects information in several ways.&nbsp;Some information is gathered if you fill out the form provided.&nbsp;This information includes, but is not limited to, your name, address, phone number, age, email address, and information concerning your educational interests.&nbsp;You may also choose to submit optional information, such as a password if you register. &nbsp;We often indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional.&nbsp;Additionally, we save browsing and data log information linked to your account.&nbsp;We also collect personal information when you report a problem, either through the Site’s contact form or email system.&nbsp;We may also collect information that you post on our blogs, message boards, or forums. &nbsp;If you contact EducationDynamics, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</p>
<p><b>What are “cookies” and how does EducationDynamics use them?</b></p>
<p>Data collection devices, “cookies” (including without limitation “confirmation pixels” for crediting affiliate marketers and/or for other purposes) are used to store, and sometimes track, information about you.&nbsp;Generally, cookies help provide personalized services and promote trust and safety.&nbsp;A cookie is a small file containing a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and placed on your computer’s hard drive to assist us in providing our services.&nbsp;All pages on the Site where you are prompted to login or that are customizable may require that you accept cookies.&nbsp;Our cookies are only read by the server that placed them and are unable to execute any code or virus.&nbsp;More specifically, we may use cookies to:</p>
<p>(1) Remind us of who you are when you login and to access your account information in order to deliver to you a more personalized service;</p>
<p>(2) Allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session;</p>
<p>(3) Measure your visiting patterns and education-related parameters in the aggregate.&nbsp;Aggregate data (data gathered across all user accounts) may be gathered in a non-personally identifiable form to build higher quality online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors, such as how long and how often users view certain pages;</p>
<p>(4) Determine your clickstream to the Site;</p>
<p>(5) Better personalize the content that you and other users will see on the Site;</p>
<p>(6) Collect IP addresses and log-in information for system administration;</p>
<p>(7) Automatically share some information with Google Analytics and other analytics programs to analyze a broad range of information.&nbsp;However, the analytics are exclusively for our internal use to better manage the website experience for our visitors and evaluate advertising strategies and tactics; and</p>
<p>(8) Other purposes to assist us in delivering the highest quality service possible.</p>
<p>You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits.</p>
<p><b>How does EducationDynamics use my information?</b></p>
<p>EducationDynamics uses your information to provide you with a customized browsing experience.&nbsp;We also may use your personal information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, respond to your inquiries, detect and protect against error, fraud, or other criminal activity, enforce our User Agreement, and for any other purposes that EducationDynamics deems appropriate.</p>
<p>In order to provide services free of charge, we may display advertisements.&nbsp;The advertiser never has access to individual account information.&nbsp;Only EducationDynamics has access to individuals’ accounts.&nbsp;By accepting the User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive these advertisements.</p>
<p><b>Who is collecting information?</b></p>
<p>When you are using the Site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with EducationDynamics. You acknowledge that data can be collected, maintained by, or transferred to a company, an educational institution, or other entity, within the sole judgment of EducationDynamics.&nbsp;You also acknowledge and agree that the data can be combined and/or refined and/or used in any other matter with data from any of the websites owned and/or operated, in whole or in part, by EducationDynamics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be advised that EducationDynamics advertisers or websites that have links on the Site may collect personally identifiable information about you.&nbsp;The information practices of those websites linked to EducationDynamics.com are not covered by this Policy.</p>
<p><b>With whom does EducationDynamics.com share my information?</b></p>
<p>EducationDynamics will not disclose your personally identifiable information except as described below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use our Site or if you post on our blogs, forums, message boards, or chat rooms, some personally identifiable information may be seen by other members or users.&nbsp;This includes, but is not limited to, the poster’s name, date of post, comments, IP address, survey responses, and other information. &nbsp;This information may also be transferred to any outside entity, including the press or other media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of our employees and contractors are subject to non-disclosure agreements with us.&nbsp;These and other legal restrictions may prohibit their use of the information you provide us for any purpose except to facilitate the specific EducationDynamics-related operation, unless you explicitly agreed or gave your prior permission to them for additional uses.</p>
<p>If you complete a transaction with an advertiser linked to EducationDynamics, the information obtained during your visit to that advertiser, and the information you give, may be provided to the advertiser.&nbsp;Advertisers linked to the Site have separate policy practices for which EducationDynamics has no responsibility or liability.</p>
<p>We may disclose account information where we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating EducationDynamics’s policies as specified in the Privacy Policy or relevant User Agreement, may be violating state or federal law, or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) EducationDynamics’s rights or property, other users of the Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.&nbsp;EducationDynamics may disclose or access account information when we believe that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain and improve our services.</p>
<p>We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Policy.&nbsp;For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they unlawfully collect from the Site.&nbsp;We will try to protect your privacy, however, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</p>
<p><b>What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?</b></p>
<p>EducationDynamics will contact you (by email, phone, and/or mail) if you complete a contact form on the Site, if you register for a membership, or if you contact us directly by direct mail or email.&nbsp;We will also contact you regarding any problems with your account and for website misuse.&nbsp;We may also contact you regarding our services, such as new features regarding our websites or other education-related updates.&nbsp;We may also contact you about “special offers” from our partners.&nbsp;Also, we may contact you to check on the status of your enrollment or other education-related activities.&nbsp;Simply send us an email to website@educationdynamics.com if you do not wish to receive optional communications.</p>
<p><b>How may I use other users’ information?</b></p>
<p>Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all applicable local laws and rules regarding online conduct and privacy, as well as content.&nbsp;Specifically, but not as a limitation, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding transmission of technical and personal data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.</p>

<p>Whenever EducationDynamics handles your personal information, we take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the relevant User Agreement and this Policy.&nbsp;Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States.&nbsp;We use procedural and mechanical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption.&nbsp;Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp;We cannot, therefore, warrant or ensure the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.&nbsp;Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of the Site, your registration/account information may be password protected so that only you have access to this personal information.&nbsp;We recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone.&nbsp;EducationDynamics will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or unsolicited email.&nbsp;If you choose to share your user name and password or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party’s privacy policy.&nbsp;If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.&nbsp;Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.</p>
<p><b>Additional Information</b></p>
<p>Any questions regarding this statement should be directed to website@educationdynamics.com.</p>
<p>This Policy, and the relevant User Agreement, are the sole authorized statements of EducationDynamics’s practices with respect to the online collection of personally identifiable information and the usage of such information.&nbsp;Any summaries of this Policy generated by third party software or otherwise shall have no legal effect, are in no way binding upon EducationDynamics, shall not be relied upon in substitute for this Policy, and neither supersede nor modify this Policy.</p>
<p>EducationDynamics reserves the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from visitors, or that we otherwise collect concerning or in connection with the Site, to a third party in the event of a sale or other transfer of assets or of any portion of our business.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or account information.&nbsp;Please be careful and responsible.</p>
