	        Edustudies.com understands that you are concerned about how your information is used and shared. This notice explains our privacy policy and how your information may or may not be used by our site.<br>
		    <br>
		  By visiting Edustudies.com you are accepting the terms described in our privacy policy. </p>
	        <p class="body_text">What personal information about customers does Edustudies.com gather?
	        <br>
	      Information we gather on our site helps us enhance the experience that future visitors may have on our site. Here are the types of information we gather:</p>
	      <ul>
	        <li class="body_text"><strong>Information You   Give Us</strong><br>
	          On our site, you will find a   variety of forms. Each form pertains to a particular school or educational   institution. Each form may collect information such as Name, Phone number, email   address, postal address, gender, and age. Not all forms require all the   information. You can choose not to provide the information, but you may not be   able to complete the process of requesting information from that school. We use   the information you provide to inform the schools of your interest and the best   way of getting in contact with you. You will usually be contacted via phone or   email by a representative of the school. You may request information from more   than one school, which means you may be contacted by each school. We do not   resell the information to any company unless you authorize us to do so, by   agreeing to be part of the <a href="http://Edustudies.com" target="_blank">Edustudies.com</a> newsletter. This is not a required question to complete the form. <br>
	          <br>
            We   also want you to know that we do at times send the information to third party   validation services to ensure all of the information is accurate and true. This   helps us ensure that the schools which you are requesting information from have   the most accurate way of getting in contact with you. </li>
	        </ul>
	      <ul>
	        <li class="body_text"><strong>Automatic   Information</strong><br>
  We receive and store certain   types of information when you interact with our site. Our site uses "cookies"   like many other sites. This helps us determine what browser you are using and   how to best present the information to you. Some automatic information examples   are: browser type, operating system, IP address, and date and time of   information request. You can disable cookies in your web browser, however this   may affect the experience you have on our site, since you may not be able to see   all of the features. The cookies we set do have an expiration date and will   automatically be disabled after the expiration date. <br>
	        <br>
	        </li>
	        <li class="body_text"><strong>Information from   Other Sources</strong><br>
            We do receive information from other sources and append this to the information   that is sent to each school. Examples of this information are the following:   Source of where you initially clicked on an advertisement, what you may have   typed in, during your search at <span id="lw_1205728874_7">Google</span>, Yahoo!,   Ask, or MSN which spawns our advertisement. This information helps us better   optimize our site based on your information needs.	        </li>

	      <p class="body_text"><strong>Does <a href="http://Edustudies.com.com" target="_blank"><span id="lw_1205728874_8">Edustudies.com</span></a> share the information we receive?</strong><br>
	        Information about   our customers is very important to us. We do reserve the right to sell the   information to other parties if you willfully agree to be part of our   newsletter. However, we will only disclose your email address. <br>
	        <br>
	        The information that is submitted to each school is not subject to being sold to   anyone else except the school you have requested information from. Our   relationships and contracts with the schools prohibit us from contacting you   directly without your expressed consent. <br>
