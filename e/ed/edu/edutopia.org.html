<h4 class="subheadleft">Privacy Policy</h4>


<p>The George Lucas Educational Foundation (GLEF) is firmly committed to respecting the privacy rights of all visitors to our Web site. This privacy policy will advise you about how we protect your personal information. Please read this policy carefully. We may need to change this policy from time to time in order to address new issues and reflect changes on our Web site. All changes will be posted here.
</p>


<p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?:</strong>
</p>

<p>Generally, we limit the collection of information to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (such as first name, age, state, or country).  We will not require you to provide more information than is necessary to participate in any of our Web site activities. This information is collected so that visitors can participate in activities (such as receiving our Edutopia News e-newsletter updates or participating in our polls).
</p>
<p>However, in some areas on our Web site personally identifiable information is asked for and collected (for example, the necessary personal information to subscribe to our magazine). Whenever we request that you submit such information, we will endeavor to notify you of our intended use of the information, as more specifically discussed below.  PLEASE BE AWARE THAT YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE, AND CAN DECLINE TO PROVIDE, ANY REQUESTED INFORMATION AT ANY TIME. HOWEVER, IF YOU DECLINE, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES ON THIS WEB SITE. 
</p>
<p>The types of information collected at this Web site may include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact information, such as full name, e-mail address, and mailing address when subscribing to our magazine or ordering products.</li>
<li>Financial information and/or Credit/Debit Card data (for, by way of example, online purchases of GLEF products).</li>
<li>Demographic information, such as date of birth, age, profile, gender, state, and country.</li>
<li>Internet Protocol (IP) Information, such as your IP address and browser type.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION?:</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>Subscription:</strong><br>
Our Web site's subscription form requires users to give us contact information, unique identifiers, and demographic information. All subscriber information is submitted to us on a voluntary basis. We may also ask subscribers to tell us how they found out about us. Once you subscribe, we use customer contact information from the subscription form to contact you, to send you information about our foundation, and/or to give you updates on products and/or services. 
</p>

<p><strong>Collecting and Sharing Data:</strong><br>
<!-- We sometimes collect information to find out how people found our Web site, which pages they visited, and how long they stayed. In addition, we may aggregate demographic, profile, and non-personal information you provide and use aggregate information to better design our Web site and to improve our marketing strategy and our product offerings. We do NOT sell, trade, or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information with third parties. -->
We sometimes collect information to find out how people found our Web site, which pages they visited, and how long they stayed. In addition, we may aggregate  demographic and non-personal information you provide and use aggregate information to better design our Web site and to improve our marketing strategy and our  product offerings. If you are 13 or older, we may share this demographic and non-personal information with our advertisers, licensees and/or other business partners with whom we link to permit them to contact you with information about certain products and services. If you are under 13, we will not share your personal information with third parties.
<br><br>
Other than as explained in this policy, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is  reasonably necessary to: comply with legal processes; respond to any claims; or, protect the rights, property or personal safety of The George Lucas Educational Foundation, its subsidiaries and affiliates, our customers or the public. In addition, information about our customers, including, without limitation personal information regarding customers under 13,  may be disclosed as part of any bankruptcy, merger, sale, transfer of company assets or acquisition.
</p>
<p><strong>Mailing lists:</strong><br>
Where appropriate and if you are 13 or older, the option to allow us to share certain information with some of our promotional partners may be provided, or the option  for you to elect not to have us share certain information may be provided. If you are under 13, we will not share your personal information with third parties. You always have the right to unsubscribe from any mailing lists we may maintain. Parents, you can always ask us to review or delete any of your child's  information and you can refuse to permit further collection and use of your child's information at any time by sending us a written request at the Contact Information  below. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS ACTIVITY.
</p>
<p><strong>E-mail and Newsletters:</strong><br>
We may offer fully interactive registered email services. Our newsletters may include links to independently operated Web site. Although we do not provide any personally identifiable information about kids under 13 to any "independently-operated Web sites" (that is, a Web site not owned, controlled and operated  by us), such Web Site(s) may solicit personally identifiable information from kids under 13. Please be aware that we don't control and are not responsible for their actions, privacy policy(ies) or terms of use. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN EITHER OF THESE ACTIVITIES.
</p>




<p><strong>ONLINE STORE:</strong>
</p>
<p>Yahoo! Store hosts the ordering
system and order data. Yahoo! automatically collects order information but
may only use this information in the aggregate. Please see the 
<a href="http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/" target="new">Yahoo! Privacy Policy</a> for more
information about how Yahoo! uses this information.</p>

<p><strong>Purchasing Items:</strong><br>
Purchasing items from our online store may require the giving of personally identifiable information (such as name and credit card information). IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS ACTIVITY.
</p>

<p><strong>Security of Credit Card Information:</strong><br>
We have selected Yahoo! Store to provide us with our e-commerce software.  All transactions within our online store are handled using Stronghold, an industry standard advanced data encryption system used to ensure the security and confidentiality of information exchanged between your browser and this Web site's e-commerce servers. All of your personal information (including credit card numbers) will be encrypted and then transmitted from your browser to the Yahoo! e-commerce systems securely. This information can only be unencrypted by The George Lucas Educational Foundation or its agents. 
</p>

<p>We can only guarantee secure transactions with orders placed directly from this Web site using our secure online ordering system. We cannot guarantee secure transactions for orders sent to us via e-mail.  More information about the online store security is available <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/vm/security.html" target="new">here</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Use of Cookies:</strong><br>
A cookie is a small data file stored on the user's hard drive which may contain information about the user.  We currently use cookies in connection with our online store hosted by Yahoo!. The Yahoo! Store uses cookies to keep track of each shopper's basket. When you arrive at our store, we give you a unique cookie. When you click on an Order button, we use the cookie to decide what shopping basket to put the product into. Note that Yahoo! does not store any information in the cookies themselves. We also use cookies to keep track of your preferences for the Video Gallery and to limit the number of times pop-ups occur for each user.  
</p>

<p><strong>IP Address and Machine Type:</strong><br>
An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from our Web site, our servers log your IP address. An IP address does not contain personally identifiable information. Except with respect to our e-commerce activities (e.g., online purchases) and e-newsletter, we do not link IP addresses with personally identifiable information. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. We may also collect information about your browser software and/or machine type (e.g., Windows, Mac, Unix, etc.). 
</p>

<p><strong>Links:</strong><br>
We do create links to the Web sites of other parties. The inherent nature of the Internet allows easy access from one Web site to another. While we certainly try not to link to any Web sites that contain unsuitable or inappropriate material, we cannot control any of these links and are not responsible for any content appearing on Web sites linked to or from our Web site, or for any personal information gathered at those independently-operated Web sites. Independently-operated Web sites are not associated with or authorized by us and may also have links leading to this Web site. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, GET YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE LINKING TO OTHER WEB SITES.
</p>

<p><strong>CHANGES:</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>Our changes:</strong><br>
We reserve the right to change or remove this privacy policy at our discretion. If we decide to change our privacy policy we will post those changes here. We encourage you to visit this area frequently to stay informed. 
</p>

You are welcome to change or delete your subscriber information at any time, update the contact information we have for you, or inform us that you do not want to receive our newsletter or other information from us.  Please write to <a href="mailto:edutopia@glef.org">edutopia@glef.org</a>.
