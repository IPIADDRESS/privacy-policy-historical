                  We use the personal information we collect for the purposes indicated
                  at the time you provide such information. For instance, if you
                  register in a contest, we will use the registration information
                  to notify contest winners; if you purchase a product, we will

                  knowingly promotes directly to children under the age of 18.
                  In addition, we may disclose personal information in the good
                  faith belief that we are required to do so by law, and/or in

                  13 with other companies. If you prefer, we will remove your name
                  from the list we provide to outside companies. To do so, please
                  email us at info@education 2020.com and use the subject line
                  "REMOVE." In special circumstances, EDUCATION 2020
                  may give other companies access to our information database,
                  but only if necessary for database or server maintenance, security,
                  or other similar services. In addition, EDUCATION 2020 may employ
                  other companies to perform functions on our behalf. Examples
                  include sending email, supplementing information or removing
                  repetitive or erroneous information from customer lists and providing
                  customer service. These entities have access to this information
                  to perform these functions on behalf of EDUCATION 2020 only and
                  may not use it for any other purpose. If we do provide access,
                  we require those other companies to sign confidentiality agreements
                  promising to keep secret any information they see. If EDUCATION

                  we might try to identify the wrongdoer, contact them, or bring
                  legal action against them. We may also disclose personal information
                  if we believe that the disclosure is required by law. In the

                  <b><font color="#006699">How does EDUCATION 2020 use cookies
                  and other similar tracking mechanisms?</font></b><br>
                  Cookies<br>
                  A "cookie" is a small file that we save on your computer's
                  hard drive which contains non-personal information. These cookies
                  help to give you faster access to pages you have already visited;
                  they allow you to personalize your pages; and they help you to
                  participate in some activities or events on the site and optimize
                  your shopping experience at our sites. We also use cookies to
                  help us figure out how many people visit our sites, which of
                  our web pages they visit, and how long they stay there. If you
                  are visiting any of our shopping sites cookies keep track of
                  items in your shopping cart and wish list. This information helps
                  us figure out which of our web features are highly successful
                  and which sites might need improvement. You can disable cookies
                  on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options
                  menus in your browser. Most browsers accept cookies automatically,
                  but allow you to disable them.</p>

                  <p>Session IDs<br>
                  We use "Session IDs" to also allow EDUCATION 2020 to
                  identify a particular user across multiple web page requests.
                  This Session ID is maintained within your cookie file, where
                  possible. If cookies are not enabled, or if the user's internet
                  browser program does not support cookies then EDUCATION 2020
                  will place the Session ID in the requested web page. This allows
                  the end user to avoid having to continually re-enter certain
                  information such as account name and password for every web page
                  request. This Session ID "expires" whenever the user
                  closes their internet browser.</p>

                  <p>Web Site Tracking Reporting<br>
                  Many of our web pages also contain special electronic images
                  (called a "single-pixel gif" or "gifs") that
                  allow us to gather only non-personally identifiable traffic statistics
                  and other aggregate information about visitors to our sites.
                  We use this technology to collect and accumulate anonymous data
                  that helps us understand and analyze the experience of people
                  visiting our web sites and, along with other information you
                  provide, customize your future visits and improve our web sites.
                  For example, we capture data on the type of browser used, operating
                  system software (e.g. Windows 95 vs. 98 or Macintosh), cookie
                  preferences (whether the user has them turned on or off), and
                  search engine keywords (what key words did a visitor use to get
                  to our site). We also record number of visits, paths taken, and
                  time spent on sites and pages within the EDUCATION 2020 sites.
                  Please keep in mind that none of this information is personally
                  identifiable and that we only distribute this information to
                  internal staff at EDUCATION 2020 and to partners that have signed
                  confidentiality agreements with us. Any information that we do
                  share with partners reflects overall web site or Internet usage
                  trends, not individual.</p>

                  <p>Log Data<br>
                  For administrative purposes, we collect IP addresses, which is
                  the automatic number assigned to your computer when you surf
                  the web, as well as operating system, browser, URL clickstream
                  to, through and from our sites, reference site domain name as
                  well as log time and date every time you visit our sites. This
                  data is used to maximize the performance and efficiency of our
                  sites. While the cookie may store first name or user name in
                  the cookie it does not collect any personally identifiable or
                  on-line contact information like a full name and address, so
                  you and your family remain anonymous.</p>

                  <p>Email Tracking<br>
                  We also include a small image in most emails that we send to
                  subscribers. As above, this allows us to gather only non-personally
                  identifiable traffic statistics and other aggregate information
                  about our email audience. These images notify special computers
                  when you open an email and if you clicked on a link within the
                  email. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our newsletters
                  and other emails so that we can make sure we're providing you
                  with the information and content in which you are most interested.
                  In addition, some advertising networks that serve ads on our
                  web sites or within our emails may use similar images or other
                  technology within their banner advertisements to track traffic
                  statistics. Naturally, once you leave our web sites or emails
                  by clicking on one of these advertisements, EDUCATION 2020 does
                  not have control over and is not responsible for the advertising
                  networks or other third parties and the data they collect.</p>
