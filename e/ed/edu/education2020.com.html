                                    <br>
                                    EDUCATION 2020 adheres to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA)
                                    and the guidelines of the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council
                                    of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. Parents can help by spending time online with your
                                    children and monitoring your children's online use. Please help us protect your
                                    child's privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this
                                    site or any other, or within any software registration process, without your permission.<br>

                                    EDUCATION 2020 doesn't require anyone to share any personal information about them
                                    in order to visit our web sites. However, many of our sites contain special sections
                                    and privileges for registered members. We do not collect any personal information
                                    from you unless it is provided voluntarily, for example: when you sign a guest book,
                                    register for contests, downloads, or free demos, complete our online customer surveys,
                                    send online greeting cards, purchase products, etc. Visitors to our sites must be
                                    18 years or older with a valid credit card to purchase products. The personal information
                                    we may ask for includes first and last name, mailing address, phone number, and
                                    an email address (in addition we may collect credit card information and mailing
                                    and/or shipping address information if you are purchasing products from one of our
                                    sites). See below for how we use this information.

                                <p>
                                    If we determine a child under 13 sends a request to us, we keep their email address
                                    for long enough to respond to them. EDUCATION 2020 deletes this information from
                                    our system after we answer their question.

                                    We use the personal information we collect for the purposes indicated at the time
                                    you provide such information. For instance, if you register in a contest, we will
                                    use the registration information to notify contest winners; if you purchase a product,
                                    we will use the information to fulfill the order; if you send an online greeting
                                    card, we will use the information to deliver the greeting to the provided recipient;
                                    etc. Only with consent at the time we ask for information, we might also email or
                                    mail you to provide you with information on upcoming EDUCATIN news and products,
                                    web site updates, updates on your order, and promotions. With your additional consent,
                                    we may also share information with third parties so that they can inform you and
                                    your family about their products, which might be of interest to you. EDUCATION 2020
                                    never knowingly promotes directly to children under the age of 18. In addition,
                                    we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required
                                    to do so by law, and/or in cooperation with law enforcement or other government
                                    officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement,
                                    or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.</p>

                                    Except for maintenance and security reasons, we never knowingly share personal information
                                    that we receive from children under 13 with other companies. If you prefer, we will
                                    remove your name from the list we provide to outside companies. To do so, please

                                    In special circumstances, EDUCATION 2020 may give other companies access to our
                                    information database, but only if necessary for database or server maintenance,
                                    security, or other similar services. In addition, EDUCATION 2020 may employ other
                                    companies to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include sending email, supplementing
                                    information or removing repetitive or erroneous information from customer lists
                                    and providing customer service. These entities have access to this information to
                                    perform these functions on behalf of EDUCATION 2020 only and may not use it for
                                    any other purpose. If we do provide access, we require those other companies to
                                    sign confidentiality agreements promising to keep secret any information they see.
                                    If EDUCATION 2020 believes that anyone's behavior on any of our sites may damage
                                    us, our sites, or anyone else, we may disclose the relevant personal information
                                    in order to prevent harm. In that case, we might try to identify the wrongdoer,
                                    contact them, or bring legal action against them. We may also disclose personal
                                    information if we believe that the disclosure is required by law. In the event that
                                    any of the assets relating to EDUCATION 2020 are transferred or sold to another

                                    We often have messages for our customers scheduled several weeks in advance, so

                                    <strong>How does EDUCATION 2020 use cookies and other similar tracking mechanisms?</strong><br>
                                    Cookies<br>
                                    A "cookie" is a small file that we save on your computer's hard drive
                                    which contains non-personal information. These cookies help to give you faster access
                                    to pages you have already visited; they allow you to personalize your pages; and
                                    they help you to participate in some activities or events on the site and optimize
                                    your shopping experience at our sites. We also use cookies to help us figure out
                                    how many people visit our sites, which of our web pages they visit, and how long
                                    they stay there. If you are visiting any of our shopping sites cookies keep track
                                    of items in your shopping cart and wish list. This information helps us figure out
                                    which of our web features are highly successful and which sites might need improvement.
                                    You can disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or
                                    options menus in your browser. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but allow
                                    you to disable them.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Session IDs<br>
                                    We use "Session IDs" to also allow EDUCATION 2020 to identify a particular
                                    user across multiple web page requests. This Session ID is maintained within your
                                    cookie file, where possible. If cookies are not enabled, or if the user's internet
                                    browser program does not support cookies then EDUCATION 2020 will place the Session
                                    ID in the requested web page. This allows the end user to avoid having to continually
                                    re-enter certain information such as account name and password for every web page
                                    request. This Session ID "expires" whenever the user closes their internet
                                    browser.</p>

                                    Web Site Tracking Reporting<br>
                                    Many of our web pages also contain special electronic images (called a "single-pixel
                                    gif" or "gifs") that allow us to gather only non-personally identifiable
                                    traffic statistics and other aggregate information about visitors to our sites.
                                    We use this technology to collect and accumulate anonymous data that helps us understand
                                    and analyze the experience of people visiting our web sites and, along with other
                                    information you provide, customize your future visits and improve our web sites.
                                    For example, we capture data on the type of browser used, operating system software
                                    (e.g. Windows 95 vs. 98 or Macintosh), cookie preferences (whether the user has
                                    them turned on or off), and search engine keywords (what key words did a visitor
                                    use to get to our site). We also record number of visits, paths taken, and time
                                    spent on sites and pages within the EDUCATION 2020 sites. Please keep in mind that
                                    none of this information is personally identifiable and that we only distribute
                                    this information to internal staff at EDUCATION 2020 and to partners that have signed
                                    confidentiality agreements with us. Any information that we do share with partners
                                    reflects overall web site or Internet usage trends, not individual.</p>

                                    For administrative purposes, we collect IP addresses, which is the automatic number
                                    assigned to your computer when you surf the web, as well as operating system, browser,
                                    URL clickstream to, through and from our sites, reference site domain name as well

                                    or user name in the cookie it does not collect any personally identifiable or on-line
                                    contact information like a full name and address, so you and your family remain

                                    Email Tracking<br>
                                    We also include a small image in most emails that we send to subscribers. As above,
                                    this allows us to gather only non-personally identifiable traffic statistics and
                                    other aggregate information about our email audience. These images notify special
                                    computers when you open an email and if you clicked on a link within the email.
                                    This helps us measure the effectiveness of our newsletters and other emails so that
                                    we can make sure we're providing you with the information and content in which you
                                    are most interested. In addition, some advertising networks that serve ads on our
                                    web sites or within our emails may use similar images or other technology within
                                    their banner advertisements to track traffic statistics. Naturally, once you leave
                                    our web sites or emails by clicking on one of these advertisements, EDUCATION 2020
                                    does not have control over and is not responsible for the advertising networks or
                                    other third parties and the data they collect.</p>
