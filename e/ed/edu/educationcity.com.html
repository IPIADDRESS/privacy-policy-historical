	Protecting your privacy is important to us. We hope the following privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") will help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us on this EducationCity.com web site (the "Site.</p>
<p>
	We are committed to making your use of the Site easy and enjoyable as possible. Please take a moment to read the following Privacy Policy to determine how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings. By using the Site, or providing the information requested by the Site, or by continuing to use the Site after having an opportunity to review this Privacy Policy, you agree to accept the terms of our Privacy Policy and our use of the information we collect. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.</p>
<p>
	EducationCity.com reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time without giving you prior notice. Your use of the Site following any such modification constitutes your agreement to be bound by this Privacy Policy as modified.</p>
<p>
	I. What personally identifiable information does EducationCity.com collect from me and how does EducationCity.com use my information?</p>
<p>
	We use other trusted third party business partners to host a short survey or offer form on the Site which, with your consent, will collect the personally identifiable information entered on the preceding address form page in order to supply you with information about various special offers and services. If you agree to participate in a special offer hosted by a third party business partner, your personally identifiable information included in the short survey or offer form will be transferred by our third party business partners to EducationCity.com only.&nbsp; All information provided to our third party business partners is subject to the posted privacy policies of our third party business partners. For your protection, our third party business partners are prohibited from accessing any of your personal information until you consent to such transfer and such business partner has provided you a link to its privacy policy. We urge you to review such privacy policy before consenting to the transfer of your personal information.</p>
<p>
	In order to enhance the service we provide, and to expedite systemic processes, we may pre-populate data fields on a third party business partner's survey or offer form with the information that you provided to EducationCity.com on the Site. Additionally, we may use certain third party business partners to host the survey or offer form and transfer the completed survey or offer form to other third party business partners. In an effort to safeguard your privacy, third party business partners are contractually prohibited from using any information in a pre-populated data field until they have posted a link to the privacy policy of the third party business partner/advertiser listed in the applicable offer and you have consented to the transfer of such personal information by consenting to the offer or submitting the survey. Likewise, third party business partners that serve as the host of the survey or offer form are contractually prohibited from using or retaining your personal information for any purpose other than the compilation and transfer of such personal information to EducationCity.com. Once your personal information is transferred to a third party business partner your personal information is subject to that partner's privacy policy and EducationCity.com is not responsible for use of your personal information by such business partner.</p>
<p>
	In a further effort to safeguard your privacy, you are provided with the option of exiting the survey or offer process of our third party business partners at any time prior to submitting your personal information to such third party business partner offer or survey. You must consent to each offer on an individual basis for your personally identifiable information to be transmitted, accessed and used by such third party business partner.</p>
<p>
	When you place an order or renew your subscription your information will be requested again. Our suppliers will also safeguard your personal information and are contractually prohibited from disclosing your personal information to other parties for any reason. They will not have access to any referral information you provide.</p>
<p>
	Our goal is to deliver surveys, offers and promotions to people who we believe will find them of value. Offers are developed and managed under strict conditions designed to safeguard the security and privacy of customer personal information. When you click on a survey, offer or competition you will be redirected to the appropriate site. An instruction box will appear explaining to which survey, offer or promotion you are being redirected. Although the site may still display an EducationCity.com address on the landing page, you are in fact on a third party offer provider's website, and any information you submit will be transmitted to this third party.</p>
<p>
	As a member of the Site, we will be sending transactional emails for various reasons as you continue to use our site. For example, a welcome email will be sent thanking you for joining, or an email telling you an about exciting offers and other services we offer etc. These emails are required for logistical purposes and users cannot opt-out of these at any time.</p>
<p>
	If you contact EducationCity.com, we may keep a record of that correspondence. Wherever EducationCity.com collects personal information, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that specified page.</p>
<p>
	With your consent, EducationCity.com may from time to time send commercial e-mails with additional offers and products. EducationCity.com is committed to ethical and responsible e-mail practices. Accordingly, EducationCity.com strives to make sure that all commercial e-mails sent by EducationCity.com are compliant with current legislation in force concerning the use of commercial email.

<p>
	With your prior consent, we will work with other third party businesses using the personal information that you supply to us on the main signup page to bring selected retail opportunities to our members via direct mail, email and telemarketing. These businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation and email marketing. At any time, you may choose to unsubscribe from third party commercial e-mail messages by logging into your Member account on EducationCity.com, clicking on the unsubscribe link and entering the e-mail address that you wish to unsubscribe from further commercial e-mail messages from third parties. Keep in mind that if you take advantage of an offer from an EducationCity.com business partner and thus, become their customer, they may independently wish to send offers to you. In the event that you are not interested in receiving future offers from these affiliates, you must contact them directly to fulfill your list removal request.</p>
<p>
	We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>
	We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site.

EducationCity.com uses cookies to better understand your traffic patterns on the Site as well as keeping your login information securely stored. This information helps us improve the navigation and flow of the web site. Additionally this may allow users who choose to be remembered when they come back to the Site to be automatically logged in. We link cookies to personally identifiable information so that we may track your activities on the Site. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you choose to disable the use of cookies the product will not function.

<p>

<p>
	III. Who is collecting information?</p>
<p>
	When you are on the Site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with EducationCity.com, unless it is specifically stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy or in an offer or survey form or registration form that you may be asked to complete as part of utilizing the service. For example, with your consent certain information like name, e-mail address and address, as well as your responses to survey questions, may be shared with affiliates and trusted business partners to better provide the services offered on the Site.</p>
<p>
	Please be aware that EducationCity.com partners, advertisers and web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you.

<p>
	IV. With whom does EducationCity.com share my information?</p>
<p>
	As set forth in Section I, EducationCity.com, may submit your personal information to third party business partners to participate in their offer, promotion or survey. Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, EducationCity.com will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when you have decided to opt-in to receive information, we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described in this Privacy Policy. The following describes some of the additional ways that your information may be disclosed.</p>
<p>
	a. Business Partners &amp; Sponsors: EducationCity.com may disclose your personal information to trusted business partners with your consent. Some or all data collected on the Site may be shared with a business partner. For example, you may consent to the transfer of your personal information by affirmatively submitting your personal information to such business partner by participating in their survey and submitting the information to the business partner.</p>
<p>
	b. Other: EducationCity.com may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating EducationCity.com's policies or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) EducationCity.com's rights or property, other EducationCity.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. EducationCity.com may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services. Lastly, EducationCity.com may disclose a users e-mail address as part of a suppression file or do-not-e-mail list to its partners and affiliates to make sure that a users unsubscribe requests are forwarded to the appropriate parties to ensure removal of the user from partner and affiliate databases in compliance with law.</p>
<p>
	c. Acquisitions. EducationCity.com may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions.

<p>
	d. Access. At any time you may send us an email to support@educationCity.com or by postal mail addressed to: EducationCity.com, 3232 McKinney Ave, Suite 400, Dallas, TX 75204, to request a listing of all the types of your personal information disclosed by EducationCity.com to third parties and business partners.

<p>
	V. What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Account information for EducationCity.com members are password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information. You may edit your EducationCity.com account information by logging into your Member account on EducationCity.com and revising your personal information.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. EducationCity.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your EducationCity.com account and close your browser window when you have finished your activities. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library.</p>
<p>
	VII. Miscellaneous Provisions.</p>
<p>
	a. Disclaimer of Liability. Under no circumstances shall EducationCity.com be liable for any damages, including, but not limited to, indirect, special, incidental, consequential or exemplary damages, that result from the use of the information or materials posted to or collected as a result of the user's accessing the Site or use of the service provided by EducationCity.com, even if EducationCity.com has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
