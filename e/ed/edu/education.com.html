<b><p>What Information Is Collected? </p>
</b>
<p>education.com may request and collect information from you on a voluntary basis so that you can: (1) register for an education.com account; (2) fill out a survey; (3) participate in contests, chat rooms and other community features; (4) shop or purchase online; and, (5) receive services that require registration or subscription, such as email newsletters.  The requested information may include personal identifying information such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, date of birth and valid credit card number with expiration date.<b>  </b>In addition, education.com may collect demographic information such as age, gender and hobbies.  Of course, you never have to answer any of the questions we ask you, but refusal to do so may limit the services we can offer you.</p>

<i><p>Tell-A-Friend</p>
</i><p>If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address.  education.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.  education.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.  The friend may contact education.com at <a href="mailto:jkern@education.com">jkern@education.com</a> to request the removal of this information from their database.</p>
<b>
<p>How do we use your personal information?</p>

</b><p>The personal information you provide education.com will allow us to: (1) process orders; (2) notify contest winners and fulfill prizes; (3) solicit editorials and feedback; (4) monitor and verify education.com's compliance with stated privacy policies as well as with federal, state and local laws; (5) monitor and improve the use and satisfaction of our site; and, (6) for marketing and promotional purposes.  We will only collect information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill these business objectives.  </p>

<b><p>Third Parties</p>
</b>
<p>The personal identifying information you provide us is collected by and shared among education.com sites and is not disclosed to third parties without your permission.  If education.com wishes to disclose your personal information, we will ask for your consent at the time you register.</p>

<p>However, if you place an order at the education.com On-line Store, which is operated by Digital River Inc., the personal information you provide ( name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date ) is collected by Digital River Inc.  Although Digital River Inc., not education.com, collects the personal information you provide when you order from the education.com On-line Store, education.com still requires that Digital River Inc. adhere to education.com's Privacy Policy.  This means that Digital River Inc. will never share your personal information with or sell your personal information to any third parties.    </p>

<p>education.com may disclose your personal information without consent, however, if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) education.com's rights or property, other education.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.  education.com may also disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>

<p>In addition, education.com shares aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties.  For example, we will say education.com's audience is x percent females and y percent males.  This data is used to customize education.com content and advertising to deliver a better experience for our users.</p>

<b><p>Links</p>
</b>
<p>Users should also be aware that when you are on education.com, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control.  There are links to other sites from education.com pages that take you outside our service.  For example, if you "click" on an advertisement or an education.com search result, the "click" takes you off the education.com site.  This includes links from advertisers, Center sponsors and partners that may use education.com's logo as part of a co-branding agreement.  These other sites may send you their own cookies, and collect data or solicit personal information from you.</p>

<b><p>What about Cookies and IP Addresses?</p>
</b>
<p>education.com uses cookies on its Web site. Cookies are pieces of information 
  that a web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. 
  Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences and browsing 
  patterns while you're at our site. Cookies do not track individual names, email 
  addresses or other information that is personally identifiable. Cookies are 
  necessary for some parts of the education.com service to function properly. 
  For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences 
  or you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, entering contests, 
  or playing games. </p>
<b>
</b><p>education.com also keeps track of Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses.  An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by Web servers whenever you're surfing the Web.  education.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site.  </p>

<b><p>Opt-Out</p>
</b>
<p>To keep you in control of your personal information and the communications directed to you, you may opt-out from: (1) having your personal information shared with our partners; (2) receiving communications from education.com about new features or services; (3) receiving communications from third-party companies offering a product or service that we think would be of value to you; and/or, (4) any marketing or promotional use of your personal information.   To stop any of the uses above, simply send an email to <a href="mailto:jkern@education.com">jkern@education.com</a> or modify your member information online by visiting the Member profile/preferences section at education.com.</p>
<b>
<p>What do I do if I want to correct or review my personal information?</p>
</b>
<p>To access, review, correct or delete the personal information already collected about you; or, to remove or modify the services provided to you by education.com, please visit the Member profile/preferences section of our site or contact our Customer Support organization at <a href="mailto:jkern@education.com">jkern@education.com</a>, and we will be happy to review, update or remove information as appropriate. </p>

<b><p>Safeguarding your Personal Information</p>

</b><p>To protect your personal information, we maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you provide us.  We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your personal information from your PC to our servers.  When credit card information is transmitted, for example, we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. Once your personal information has reached and is stored on our server, the information is fully secure.  </p>

<b><p>CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OLD</p>
</b>
<i><p>Information Collection and Parental Consent</p>
</i>
<p>Children under 13 may not activate a KidSpace/education.com member account without the verifiable offline consent of a parent or legal guardian ("Parent").  In order to become a KidSpace member at education.com, a child must fill out a registration form that asks for a Smart ID (nickname), password, first name, state and country of residence, birth date, gender, Parent's name and e-mail address or postal address when e-mail address is unknown.  We use this information to inform a parent, via an automatically generated email or postal mailing, of the child's interest and desire to become a KidSpace member.  If the parent does not respond within a reasonable amount of time from the time the information is collected, the child's information is deleted.  If the parent does respond, however, any additional information submitted by a parent during the registration process may be retained by KidSpace/education.com.  A parent may also agree to allow education.com collect information about his or her child without agreeing to allow the information be distributed to third parties.  </p>

<p>By providing offline consent and registering your child as a KidSpace member, you are consenting to allow your child to: (1) enter our contests; (2) submit artwork, creative writing, jokes, etc. to our online forums and galleries; and, (3) participate in our community features such as email, chat rooms (public and personal), and bulletin boards (public and personal).  Please note that education.com does not condition your child's participation in any of these activities on the child disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.  </p>

<p><i>Access and Control of Child's Information</i><br>
</p>
<p>If for any reason you wish to access, review, correct or delete the personal information already collected about your child, please visit the OurFamilySpace section of our site, and click on Parental Controls.  This area of our site allows you to approve, disapprove or change the list of friends your child has chosen for his or her KidSpace membership profile.  In addition, along with each email newsletter, we include instructions on how you may remove your child from these mailing lists.  We also notify a parent whenever his or her child (KidSpace member) wins a contest; and, we send an email to the parent associated with his or her account in order to get confirmation of eligibility and a mailing address. </p>
<p><br>
<b>Policies for Teens (Individuals 13-17 Years of Age)</b></p>

<p>Teens are asked to provide the e-mail address of a parent or guardian. If the parent or guardian e-mail address is provided, a notification message is then sent to the parent or guardian informing them of the teens' membership at education.com.</p>
<p><br>
<b>Internet Safety Tips:</b> </p>


<ul>
<li>Keep your passwords private, even from your best friend! Your online service will never ask for them, so neither should anyone else. </li>
<li>Use only your member name and/or e-mail address when chatting or sending e-mail. Never give out personal information like your name, address, or phone number. </li>
<li>Always delete unknown e-mail attachments before opening them. They can contain destructive viruses. </li>
<li>Remember that nothing you write on the Web is completely private - including email.  So be careful and think about what you type in and whom you talk to.  Not everyone is as nice, cute and funny as they may sound online.  Never make plans to meet an online "friend" in person. </li></ul>
