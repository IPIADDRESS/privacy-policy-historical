<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p>Welcome to www.edulands.com (the "Site").<br>
  <br>
  We understand that privacy   online is important to users of our Site, especially when conducting business. <br>
  This statement governs our privacy policies with respect to those users of   the Site ("Visitors") who visit without <br>
  transacting business and Visitors   who register to transact business on the Site and make use of the various   services offered by www.edulands.com (collectively, "Services") ("Authorized   Customers").<br>

  In addition to our direct collection of   information, our third party service vendors (such as credit card companies,   clearinghouses and banks) who may provide such services as credit, insurance,   and escrow services may collect this information from our Visitors and   Authorized Customers. We do not control how these third parties use such   information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal information   provided to them from Visitors and Authorized Customers. Some of these third   parties may be intermediaries that act solely as links in the distribution   chain, and do not store, retain, or use the information given to   them.<br>
  <br>

  We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the   Site, to make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling   requests on the Site. We may email Visitors and Authorized Customers about   research or purchase and selling opportunities on the Site or information   related to the subject matter of the Site.

We also offer the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving information or   being contacted by us or by any agency acting on our behalf. <br>
  <br>

  Visitors and   Authorized Customers may opt out of receiving unsolicited information from or   being contacted by us and/or our vendors and affiliated agencies by responding   to emails as instructed, or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@edulands.com">support@edulands.com</a><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Are   Cookies Used on the Site?</strong><br>
  Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We   use Cookies to obtain information about the preferences of our Visitors and the   services they select. We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect our   Authorized Customers. For example, if an Authorized Customer is logged on and   the site is unused for more than 10 minutes, we will automatically log the   Authorized Customer off.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How does www.edulands.com use login   information? </strong><br>
  www.edulands.com uses login information, including, but not   limited to, IP addresses, ISPs, and browser types, to analyze trends, administer   the Site, track a user's movement and use, and gather broad demographic   information.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>What partners or service providers have access to   Personally Identifiable Information from Visitors and/or Authorized Customers on   the Site?</strong><br>
  www.edulands.com has entered into and will continue to enter   into partnerships and other affiliations with a number of vendors.<br>
  Such   vendors may have access to certain Personally Identifiable Information on a need   to know basis for evaluating Authorized Customers for service eligibility. <br>
  Our privacy policy does not cover their collection or use of this   information. <br>
  Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to comply   with law. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information in order to   comply with a court order or subpoena or a request from a law enforcement agency   to release information. We will also disclose Personally Identifiable   Information when reasonably necessary to protect the safety of our Visitors and   Authorized Customers. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How does the Site keep Personally Identifiable   Information secure?</strong><br>
  All of our employees are familiar with our security   policy and practices. The Personally Identifiable Information of our Visitors   and Authorized Customers is only accessible to a limited number of qualified   employees who are given a password in order to gain access to the information.   We audit our security systems and processes on a regular basis. Sensitive   information, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers, is   protected by encryption protocols, in place to protect information sent over the   Internet. While we take commercially reasonable measures to maintain a secure   site, electronic communications and databases are subject to errors, tampering   and break-ins, and we cannot guarantee or warrant that such events will not take   place and we will not be liable to Visitors or Authorized Customers for any such   occurrences. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally   Identifiable Information?</strong><br>
  Visitors and Authorized Customers may contact   us to update Personally Identifiable Information about them or to correct any   inaccuracies by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@edulands.com">support@edulands.com</a> <br>

  We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism   to delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's   database by contacting <a href="mailto:support@edulands.com">support@edulands.com</a>. However, because of   backups and records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor's   entry without retaining some residual information. An individual who requests to   have Personally Identifiable Information deactivated will have this information   functionally deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally   Identifiable Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?</strong><br>
  We will let our   Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes to our privacy policy by   posting such changes on the Site. However, if we are changing our privacy policy   in a manner that might cause disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information   that a Visitor or Authorized Customer has previously requested not be disclosed,   we will contact such Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or   Authorized Customer to prevent such disclosure. <br>
