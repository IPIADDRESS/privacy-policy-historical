<p>At the Company, we are strongly committed to protecting privacy. The Company has adopted global privacy principles which guide how we manage and protect personal data and demonstrate how fair information practices are embedded in our culture. Read more on our <a href="https://www.edelman.com/global-privacy-principles">Global Privacy Principles</a>.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As part of our commitment, we strive to protect the privacy of visitors to the sites that we operate (collectively, the “Site”). You can navigate the majority of the Site without giving us any personal information which identifies you. However, sometimes we need additional information about you in order to provide you with information or services you want to receive from us. Also, this Site provides a variety of interactive features which provides you with a public forum through which you have the ability to provide information about yourself to the Company and others.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>In this digital world, privacy is important to the Company and should be important to you. The Company believes in transparency and we provide this notice so that you can understand our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>The Information We Collect and Process</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Company collects and processes two basic types of information:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul><li><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Personally identifiable information:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;This is information that personally identifies one individual from another or enables you to be individually contacted (for example, names, e-mail addresses and other contact information). This information is voluntarily provided to us by Site visitors and is used by us for the purpose of responding to user submissions and fulfilling requests for further information about our services.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Aggregate user and tracking information:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;This information gives us insights on how Site visitors use our site. This data is anonymous and does not contain any personally identifiable information. We use this information to ensure that our website, e-mails and marketing efforts continue to appeal to Site visitors and clients.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul><p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Information you voluntarily provide to Company</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Company only collects personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide, for example, when you use our “contact us” feature, sign up for a newsletter, set up a voluntary user profile to post content within our forums or interactive features. Examples of such personally identifiable information that you provide to us may include, among other information, your name, physical address and email address. Under such circumstances you consent to our use/processing of the information you provide consistent with this policy.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Other information the Company collects/processes</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Our Site may use technologies such as “cookies” to provide visitors with tailored information upon each visit. Cookies are a common part of many commercial websites that allow small text files to be sent by a website, accepted by a web browser and then placed on your hard drive as recognition for repeat visits to the Site. Every time you visit the Site, our servers, through cookies, pixels and/or GIF files, collect basic technical information such as your domain name, the address of the last URL visited prior to clicking through to the Site, and your browser and operating system. We may also use third party analytical tools (e.g. Google Analytics) to analyze activities on the Site and use of the Site. You do not need to enable cookies to visit the Site; however, some parts of the Site and some services may be more difficult or impossible to use if cookies are disabled. Some Company cookie files remain on your computer’s hard drive unless and until you manually delete the file.

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>The Way We Use Information</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We store the personal information you provide in a secure database in order to provide you with the information, products, and/or services you request and may be used to provide you with additional information about our services we believe may be of interest to you. The information is stored for a time period and in a manner relevant to responding to your request unless you request that it be removed. The information you provide us will be shared with the Company employees and service providers to the extent necessary to administrate our systems and/or accommodate your request.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>For example, if you provide your name, mailing address, telephone and/or email address and request more information about the Company’s services, this information will be shared with appropriate Company personnel to fulfill your request. This information will not be shared with non-affiliated third parties without your consent.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
