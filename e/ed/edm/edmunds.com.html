<p style="line-height:1.25">California Residents: See <a href="#ccpa">California Consumer  Privacy Act (CCPA) Rights and Disclosure</a> for  additional disclosure about our use and collection of your personal information. </p>

<p style="line-height:1.25">We gather certain types of information from and about the  visitors to the Edmunds Automotive Network, and we believe our visitors should  fully understand what information we gather from and about our visitors, and  how we obtain, use, share and manage that information. The Edmunds Automotive  Network consists of <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/">Edmunds.com</a> and any other Web site that we identify as a part of the  Edmunds Automotive Network; the mobile versions of our Web sites; any apps that  we offer; and widgets, tools and content from our Web site that we offer for  display on third-party web sites or apps.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.25">This Privacy Statement discloses what information we gather on  the Edmunds Automotive Network and how we obtain, use, share and manage it. In  addition, this Privacy Statement addresses our receipt and use of information  that may be "Personal information" under the California Consumer Privacy Act  (CCPA), including Personal Information collected by us from sources other than  the Edmunds Automotive Network.&nbsp; With  that exception, this Privacy Statement is not applicable to information that we  obtain through any of our other business activities or from other sources.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.25">If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy  Statement, you should contact us through our <a href="https://help.edmunds.com/anonymous_requests/new">Contact  Us</a> form.</p>


<p><strong>Your Personal Identifiable Information (PII)</strong></p>

  <p style="line-height:1.25">We collect information that you voluntarily submit to the  Edmunds Automotive Network using one or more devices to receive products and  services or related information that you request from either us or companies  with which we do business. The information you submit may include your name,  address, e-mail address, telephone number. We refer to such personally identifiable  information that you voluntarily submit to us in response to requests therefor  on the Edmunds Automotive Network as your "PII." </p>
  
<p style="line-height:1.25">Unless we have a street address (or equivalent) for you, we do  not consider your city, state or ZIP code to be your PII.&nbsp; We also collect information about the devices  you use to access the Edmunds Automotive Network as soon as you as you visit  the Edmunds Automotive Network.&nbsp; We do  not consider this information to be your PII.&nbsp;  However, certain device information of California residents may be  considered "Personal Information" under the CCPA.&nbsp; California residents: &nbsp;See "California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)  Rights and Disclosures" below for more information.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Use and Disclosure of Your Personally Identifiable Information  (PII)</strong></p>
  <p style="line-height:1.25">Your PII will be shared between us and the companies with which  we do business, and may also be disclosed to other entities that work with us  or those companies, to fulfill your request and to provide other products and  services to you.</p>
  
<p style="line-height:1.25">In addition, if you provide your PII through the use of one of  our vehicle price quote or inquiry services or dealer communication services  (collectively, "Dealer Inquiry and Communication Services"), your PII  will be shared with vehicle dealers, and may also be shared with the vehicle  manufacturers and/or their affiliated entities, distributors, agents and  contractors, who may use that information to contact you. In addition, if the  Dealer Inquiry and Communication Service you use is "co-branded" (<em>i.e.</em>,  the page or screen on which it appears displays the name of both Edmunds and  one of our partners), your PII may be shared with that partner. Edmunds cannot  control, and is not responsible for, the manner in which any of such companies  or other entities, distributors, agents, contractors or partners use your PII.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.25">If you use the Dealer Inquiry and Communication Services to  call, email, text or chat with a dealer, or if we otherwise act as an  intermediary through which communications between a dealer and you are  transmitted, a recording of your conversation, or the email, text or chat  communications, between you and that dealer (as well as the phone number or  email address from which you make such call or initiate such email, text or  chat communications), will be made available both to us and that dealer (unless  we choose to shield your email address or certain other information from that  dealer), as well as any company requested by us or the dealer to facilitate  those communications (including any social media website or application from  which you initiate a communication). When we receive that phone number or email  address, we may use it to obtain or associate additional information about you,  and we may provide that additional information to the dealer and/or those other  companies. In addition, that recording or email, text or chat communication,  that phone number or email address, and that additional information, may be  provided to vehicle manufacturers and/or their affiliated entities,  distributors, agents and contractors.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.25">We may use whatever information we may have or know about you,  including your PII, to customize or enhance your experience on the Edmunds  Automotive Network (including the display of advertisements) and to provide, or  communicate with you concerning, our products or services or those of companies  with which we do business. We may use this information to optimize the manner  in which the products or services you requested are operated and managed or to  optimize the operation and management of other product and services. We may  also use this information for purposes of reporting and analytics, including  demonstrating to the companies with which we do business the effectiveness of  our products and services. We use city, state and ZIP code (which we assign  based on your IP address) to display to you information customized for your  region.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.25">In addition, we may disclose whatever information we may have or  know about you, including your PII, without first providing additional  notification to you or obtaining your consent: (a) to third-party service  providers that provide advice, products or services to us, or that assist us to  improve our products, services or information, or to better understand their  value to our visitors or to the companies with which we do business or are  considering doing business; (b) in connection with any merger or acquisition of  Edmunds or its parent company, or any sale or other transfer of assets by  Edmunds to another entity; or (c) to other third parties if we determine that  disclosure of such information (i) is or may be required by law or legal  process, or is requested by a governmental agency, (ii) is or may be reasonably  necessary to enforce the Edmunds Automotive Network <a href="/about/visitor-agreement.html">Visitor Agreement</a>, or to  take appropriate action if a visitor or other third party is determined by us  to have violated that agreement, or (iii) is or may be reasonably necessary to  protect the rights, property or safety of Edmunds or its parent company, the  Edmunds Automotive Network, our visitors or other third parties (including,  when applicable, consumers, dealers and manufacturers).</p>

<p style="line-height:1.25">From time to time, we may also receive information requests for,  and disclose to third parties, portions of the Edmunds Automotive Network's log  files that show which "Internet service provider" a visitor has used  or other visitor information; that information may enable third parties to  discover, through that Internet service provider, the identity of a visitor.</p>


<p><strong>Choices About Use and Disclosure of Your Personally Identifiable  Information (PII)</strong></p>
  
  <p style="line-height:1.25">In certain locations on the Edmunds Automotive Network where we  obtain your PII, we may include a "check box" (or another process)  for the purpose of soliciting your consent to receive promotional and marketing  communications and/or other information from other entities selected by us. By  providing your consent (such as by "checking" the box, or leaving the  box "checked"), you are agreeing to receive promotional and marketing  communications from those other entities, and you are consenting to our  providing your PII to those other entities.</p>
  
<p style="line-height:1.25">If you no longer wish to receive promotional and marketing  communications from us or our partners, you may do so (i) if you are an Edmunds  Insider, by modifying your&nbsp; profile, (ii)  if you received a promotional or marketing email from us, by following the link  for that purpose located at the bottom of the email, or (iii)&nbsp;by sending a  request to us through our <a href="https://help.edmunds.com/anonymous_requests/new">Contact  Us</a> form. However,  withdrawing your consent will not affect the rights of the other entities that  previously received your PII to continue to send communications to you and  otherwise use your Personal Information.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.25">If you are an Edmunds Insider, we may send you certain  administrative and service messages in connection with the products and  services available to you; you cannot opt out of receiving those communications,  except as may be otherwise required under the CCPA or other United States law.</p>

<p><strong>Updating Your Personal Information</strong></p>
  
  <p style="line-height:1.25">If any of your PII submitted as a part of becoming an Edmunds Insider  changes, you may update that information by logging into your profile. If you  would like to modify any PII provided to the Edmunds Automotive Network through  the use of one of our vehicle price quote or inquiry services, or otherwise, please  send a request to us through our <a href="https://help.edmunds.com/anonymous_requests/new">Contact  Us</a> form.</p>
  
  
<p><strong>Your Precise Geolocation Information</strong></p>
  
  <p style="line-height:1.25">When you visit the Edmunds Automotive Network via your mobile  device or use our mobile apps, you may be prompted to provide your permission  to our collecting and using your precise geolocation information.</p>
  
  <p style="line-height:1.25">If you consent, we may use this information to show you nearby  inventory, dealers and pricing information. </p>
  
<p style="line-height:1.25">In addition, we may continue to collect and use your precise  geolocation information obtained through your use of our mobile site or app  even when the mobile site or app is not open to notify you when a vehicle that  you "saved" or in which you expressed interest is available at a  dealer near your current location.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.25">We may also use this information for analytics purposes.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.25">You may discontinue collection of geolocation information by  changing the app's settings or the location settings on your mobile device.</p>


<p><strong>Information We Collect  Through Cookies and Other Technologies</strong></p>

  <p style="line-height:1.25">When you visit the  Edmunds Automotive Network, we may place pieces of code, commonly referred to  as "cookies," or similar technology on your computer or other devices  you use to access the Edmunds Automotive Network, such as your mobile phone or  tablet. We use cookies to collect and retain information about you, such as  your IP address and ZIP code, as soon as you visit the Edmunds Automotive  Network.&nbsp; We also use cookies to collect  and retain additional information about you, or from activity on devices  associated with you, such as your online activities over time on the Edmunds  Automotive Network and across third-party Web sites and online services.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.25">In addition to use for our own internal business purposes  described above, we may provide this information to, or share this information  with, third parties, including third-party advertisers that display advertising  on the Edmunds Automotive Network or third-party Web sites and online services with  which we do business.&nbsp; California residents:  See "California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Rights and Disclosures" below for  more information. </p>

<p style="line-height:1.25">Edmunds has not implemented a response to browser-based Do Not  Track signals. Because of the current lack of consensus with respect to the Do  Not Track standard from both a compliance perspective and a technical  perspective, we have not yet determined if or how we would implement a response  to Do Not Track signals. We will continue to evaluate this in the event a  uniform standard is adopted.&nbsp; </p>

<p style="line-height:1.25">Certain browsers may allow you to disable cookies. However, disabling  cookies from the Edmunds Automotive Network may prevent you from using various  features of the Edmunds Automotive Network.</p>


<p><strong>Use of Social Media Accounts</strong></p>
  
  <p style="line-height:1.25">The Edmunds Automotive Network may allow you to log into and  associate your social media accounts, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,  LinkedIn, YouTube and Pinterest, with the Edmunds Automotive Network. By using  this functionality, you give the Edmunds Automotive Network permission to  access all of the elements of your social media account information that you  have made available to be shared, and to use it in accordance with the  applicable social network's terms of use.</p>
  
<p style="line-height:1.25">Your social media privacy settings may enable the Edmunds  Automotive Network to retrieve information from your social media accounts,  including your usernames, the date and time you sent messages using a social  media application, and the contents of such messages. Please refer to your  social media privacy settings for information about what data is shared with  the Edmunds Automotive Network and other connected applications, and to manage  the data that is shared through your account (including information about your  activities using the Edmunds Automotive Network). If you would like to  disconnect a social network account from the Edmunds Automotive Network, please  refer to the social media account settings of the applicable social network.</p>

<p><strong>Surveys</strong></p>
  <p style="line-height:1.25">Occasionally we or another company on our behalf may conduct visitor surveys to  better target our content to our audience, to improve our services and products,  or for the benefit of third parties with which we do business. Accordingly,  sometimes the aggregate survey results are shared with our advertisers and  other third parties. We never share any survey information about any identified  individual with any third party unless that individual consents.</p>
  
  
<p><strong>Our Community Services</strong></p>
  
  
  <p style="line-height:1.25">The Edmunds Automotive Network provides a number of means by  which you may communicate with other visitors and with us.&nbsp; In certain instances, you must first <a href="javascript:PAGESETUP.scope.modalPanel.launch({'url':'/era/secure/lb/registration.jsp'}, 'Registration', [600,560]);">become an Edmunds Insider</a> and/or agree to our Visitor  Agreement in order to add content to the Edmunds Automotive Network through  certain services, such as our Forums (the Web's most established automotive  message boards) and our Dealer Ratings &amp; Reviews. The <a href="/about/membership-agreement.html">Visitor Agreement</a> sets forth a number of information-sharing and disclosure  practices for such services, and accordingly supplements this Privacy  Statement.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of your communications  made to or through these services are referred to as "Visitor-Submitted  Content." For information concerning our use of this and other Visitor-Submitted  Content, please see our <a href="/about/visitor-agreement.html">Visitor Agreement</a>.</p>
  
  
<p><strong>Links to Other Web Sites</strong></p>
  
  <p style="line-height:1.25">The Edmunds Automotive Network contains links to many other Web  sites and online services not operated by us, including sites where you can  obtain automotive products and services. However, this Privacy Statement only  applies to the Edmunds Automotive Network and the information we collect  thereon, and we are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of  any other Web sites or online services. For additional information about those  links, please review our <a href="/about/visitor-agreement.html">Visitor Agreement</a>.</p>
  
<p><strong>Third-Party Ad Servers and Advertisers</strong></p>
  <p style="line-height:1.25">We use third party advertising serving companies to serve  advertisements; to provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response  measurement and site analytics; and to assist with delivery of relevant  marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may collect  information about your online activities over time on the Edmunds Automotive  Network and across other Web sites and online services. These advertising  serving companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail  address, telephone number or other personal information) about your visits to  the Edmunds Automotive Network in order to provide advertisements on the  Edmunds Automotive Network and other Web sites and online services.</p>
  
  
<p><strong>Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising</strong></p>
 
 <p style="line-height:1.25">The cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral  Advertising (the "Program") was developed by leading industry  associations to apply consumer-friendly standards to online behavioral  advertising across the Internet. Edmunds has elected to implement the Program.</p>
 
<p style="line-height:1.25">The Program applies to "online behavioral  advertising," which is defined as the collection of data online from a  particular computer or device regarding Web viewing behaviors over time, and  across non-affiliate Web sites, for the purpose of using such data to predict  visitor preferences or interests to deliver advertising to that computer or  device based on the preferences or interests inferred from those Web viewing  behaviors. (The Program does not apply to a Web site's collection of viewing  behavior solely for its own uses, or to "contextual advertising" that  delivers advertisements based on the content of a Web page, a search query or a  visitor's contemporaneous behavior on a Web site.)</p>


<p style="line-height:1.25">Our advertisers may from time to time use data collected about  your visits to the Edmunds Automotive Network and other Web sites to target ads  to you on the Edmunds Automotive Network and other Web sites and online  services.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.25">In addition, the Edmunds Automotive Network may from time to  time permit third parties to collect non-personally identifiable Web site usage  information about our visitors for the purpose of facilitating the serving of  targeted ads on other Web sites and online services. To do this, we permit such  third parties to place and use cookies on the browsers of our visitors, and use  Web beacons and other tracking technologies on the Edmunds Automotive Network.  These third parties may also use personally identifiable information obtained  from other sources to serve advertisements over time and across Web sites and  online services.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.25">Other companies' use of information collected through their  cookies and other tracking technologies is subject to their own privacy  policies and not this one. To learn more about your choices and how to opt out  from receiving the types of ads described above, please click <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">here</a> or paste <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> into your internet  browser.</p>


<p style="line-height:1.25">You may also opt out of tracking and receiving the types of ads  described above on your mobile device by some mobile advertising companies and  similar entities by modifying your device settings or downloading the App  Choices app at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a>. </p>



<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

  <p style="line-height:1.25">The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We  follow generally accepted industry standards to protect your Personal  Information, both during transmission to us and once we receive it.

<p><u>California Residents' CCPA Rights</u></p>

<p style="line-height:1.25">Commencing January 1, 2020, a resident of  California may request, no more than two times during any 12-month period, that  Edmunds provide the following disclosures:</p>

  <li>A copy, in electronic or written format, of the specific pieces of Personal Information that Edmund collected during the previous 12 months ("Copy of Personal &nbsp;Information Request")</li><br>
  </ul>


<p style="line-height:1.25">In addition, commencing January 1, 2020, a resident  of California may request that Edmunds:</p>
