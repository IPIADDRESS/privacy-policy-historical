<p><font class="bodytext"><strong>Date Last Revised: May 30, 2006</strong></font></p>

<p><font class="bodytext">We gather certain types of information about the visitors to the Edmunds Web Sites (Edmunds.com, <i>Inside Line</i>, and CarSpace), and we believe our visitors should fully understand how we obtain and use that information. This Privacy Statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.
<br><br>
<a href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.edmunds.com&amp;sealid=101" target="_blank"><img src="http://a332.g.akamai.net/f/332/936/12h/www.edmunds.com/help/about/media/truste.seal.gif" alt="TRUSTe Seal" width="91" height="73" border="0"></a>
<br><br>
Edmunds.com, Inc. is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This Privacy Statement covers the site www.edmunds.com. Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and have our privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.
<br><br>
If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Statement, you should contact us though our <a href="http://help.edmunds.com/cgi-bin/edmunds.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php">Contact Us</a> form. You may also contact us by mail at 2401 Colorado Avenue, Santa Monica, California 90404. If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily address, you should contact <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php" target="_blank">TRUSTe</a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.
<br><br>
The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through <i>Edmunds.com and Inside Line</i>, and does not cover information that may be collected through CarSpace or software downloaded from this Web site.</font></p>


<p><font class="bodytext"><strong>Your Personally Identifiable Information</strong></font></p>
<p><font class="bodytext">The submission by you to us of your information, including personally identifiable information (e.g., your name, your address, your e-mail address, your telephone number), may be required in order for you to receive certain services, products or information you request from either us or other companies with which we do business. This personally identifiable information may be shared between us and those companies, and may also be disclosed to other entities who work with us or those companies to fulfill your request. <strong>Edmunds cannot control, and is not responsible for, the manner in which any of such companies and other entities use such information.</strong>  Edmunds has been advised by certain manufacturers that they may contact individuals who use our Dealer Locator service (described below) to obtain price quotes for vehicles they produce.  In addition, some personally identifiable information is required in order to become a member of the Edmunds Web Sites.
<br><br>
If you give your consent, this information also may be shared with other entities to help us improve our services or to notify you about other products and services. That is, you may receive information from us or from other companies by e-mail, U.S. mail or other means. However, if we do not have your express consent, our policy is to not provide your personally identifiable information to anyone else, except as provided below. We may disclose whatever information we may have or know about you, including personally identifying information, without first notifying you or obtaining your consent, upon receipt of legal process seeking such information, or if we determine that disclosure of such information: (i) is or may be required by law; (ii) is or may be reasonably necessary to enforce the Edmunds Web Sites <a href="/townhall/memberagreement.html">Membership Agreement</a> or <a href="/help/about/visitoragreement.html">Visitor Agreement</a>, or to take appropriate action if a visitor is determined by us to have violated either of those agreements; or (iii) is or may be reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of our company, the Edmunds Web Sites, their visitors or other individuals or entities. We may also disclose to third parties, when we determine such disclosure to be appropriate under the circumstances, portions of the Edmunds Web Sites' log files that show which "Internet service provider" a visitor has used. That information may enable third parties to discover, through that Internet service provider, the identity of a visitor.
<br><br>
In certain locations on the Edmunds Web sites in which we obtain personally identifiable information from you, we may include "check boxes" for the purpose of soliciting your consent to receive special offers and/or other information from us and other entities selected by us. By leaving these check boxes "checked," you are choosing to receive commercial communications from us and/or those other entities. In that event, you will have the opportunity at any time to “opt-out” of receiving future commercial communications from us (on behalf of itself and/or such third parties) either (i) by modifying your Membership account, (ii) by following the instructions located at the bottom of the e-mail we send you, (iii) by sending a request to us through our <a href="http://help.edmunds.com/cgi-bin/edmunds.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php">Contact Us</a> form, or (iv) by sending us a request by mail to 2401 Colorado Avenue, Santa Monica, California 90404; attention: Customer Service. (However, please note that opting-out in this manner will not affect the right of such other entities to send communications to you independently of us.)</font></p>

<p><font class="bodytext"><strong>Access to Your Personally Identifiable Information</strong></font></p>
<p><font class="bodytext">If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you would like to delete any of your personally identifiable information, you may correct, update or delete it by either (i) by modifying your Membership account, (ii) by sending a request to us through our <a href="http://help.edmunds.com/cgi-bin/edmunds.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php">Contact Us</a> form, or (iii) by sending us a request by mail to 2401 Colorado Avenue, Santa Monica, California 90404; attention: Customer Service.</font></p>

<p><font class="bodytext"><strong>Your Zip Code</strong></font></p>
<p><font class="bodytext">We request your Zip Code in a number of locations on this Web site, including when you first engage in vehicle research. Providing us your Zip Code enables us to display to you vehicle selling prices adjusted for your region, incentive and rebates that apply in your region, your vehicle's five-year True Cost to Own<sup>SM</sup> for your region, and dealer listings specific to your region. We provide this information for Zip Codes that are within one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia, but not those in other U.S. territories or possessions or for the postal codes of Canada or other countries.
<br><br>
When you first provide your Zip Code to us, whether through the use of one of our applications (such as the Edmunds.com True Market Value<sup>®</sup> tools or Dealer Locator), or in response to a direct request by us that you provide your Zip Code, we serve a "cookie" to you that includes your Zip Code. ("Cookies" are described below.) That cookie permits us to recognize your Zip Code when you use other applications, or upon your return to the Edmunds Web Sites, without our having to ask you again for your Zip Code.
<br><br>
You have the opportunity to change your Zip Code at appropriate times during your visit to the Edmunds Web Sites if you want to get information for a different Zip Code; changing your Zip Code in any application automatically updates your Zip Code cookie.</font></p>

<p><font class="bodytext"><strong>Other Cookies</strong></font></p>
<p><font class="bodytext">"Cookies" are small data files that many Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file contains information such as a user ID that a site may use to track the pages you've visited. However, the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Cookies served by us don't permit us to read data from your hard drive or to read cookie files created by other Web sites.
<br><br>
We use cookies in many ways, including the following:
<br><br>
First Visits: When you first visited the Edmunds Web Sites, we served a cookie to you. This cookie resides permanently on your hard drive (unless you chose to delete it) and enables us to track visitor activity across our Web sites.
<br><br>
Applications: Whenever you use certain applications on the Edmunds Web Sites, such as Dealer Locator, we may serve a "session cookie" to you, which is a cookie that is only used by us during your use of that application. In addition, for some applications we may serve a cookie to you that has a longer expiration date. These cookies help us manage our delivery to you of application information and related content.
<br><br>
Lead Forms: In certain applications, such as Dealer Locator, you may be presented with a form that requests, among other items, your name and contact information. When this form is submitted by you the information you provide is stored on our computers, so that we have a record of what we have sent to our partners. We also serve a cookie to you that encodes where on our computers that information is maintained, so that we can "pre-fill" your name and contact information for you when in the future you call up a similar form. You may opt to not have this cookie served to you by deselecting this feature within the application.
<br><br>
Membership Registration: When you register as a member of the Edmunds Web Sites, we use a cookie to store your registration information on your computer if you click the "Remember me" box. We use this cookie to enable you to enter the Edmunds Web Sites as a member without having to sign in each time.
<br><br>
Advertisements: Our advertising system delivers cookies in order to track ad impressions and click rates. See "Third-Party Ad Servers" below.
<br><br>
Please note that we do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our Web sites.</font></p>

<p><font class="bodytext"><strong>Security</strong></font></p>
<p><font class="bodytext">The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
<br><br>
If you have any questions about security on our Website, please use our <a href="http://help.edmunds.com/cgi-bin/edmunds.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php">Contact
Us</a> form.
</font></p>

<p><font class="bodytext"><strong>Our Community Services</strong></font></p>
<p><font class="bodytext">The Edmunds Web Sites provide a number of means by which you may communicate with other visitors and with us.  Many of these are the various communication and personalization tools and services that are part of our "community" (the "Community Services"). The Community Services include our Forums (the most established automotive message boards), our CarSpace Email Service, our blogs located in both <i>Inside Line</i> and CarSpace, and a variety of other features of CarSpace.
<br><br>
In order to add content to the Edmunds Web Sites through the Community Services, you must first <a href="/apps/dcm/RegistrationNew.do">become a member</a> of the Edmunds Web Sites and agree to our Membership Agreement. (You do not need to register in order to browse or read the content provided by our members.)  The <a href="/townhall/memberagreement.html">Membership Agreement</a> sets forth a number of information sharing and disclosure practices for our Community Services, and accordingly supplements this Privacy Statement.
<br><br>
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or allow such persons to become members of the Edmunds Web Sites. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register as a member or send any information about yourself to us.  In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us through our <a href="http://help.edmunds.com/cgi-bin/edmunds.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php">Contact Us</a> form.</font></p>

<p><font class="bodytext"><strong>Visitor-Submitted Content</strong></font></p>
<p><font class="bodytext">Edmunds.com provides a number of other means by which you may communicate — with other visitors and with the Edmunds Web Sites — that do not require you to become a member of the Edmunds Web Sites. This includes our Consumer Ratings and Reviews, Letters to the Editors, Success Stories, Help and the submittal to us of a general question or comment. All of your communications made to or through those services are referred to as your "Visitor-Submitted Content."  For information concerning our use of your Visitor-Submitted Content by us, please see our <a href="/help/about/visitoragreement.html">Visitor Agreement</a>.</font></p>


<p><font class="bodytext"><strong>Surveys</strong></font></p>
<p><font class="bodytext">Occasionally we conduct visitor surveys to better target our content to our audience or for the benefit of third parties with whom we do business. Accordingly, sometimes the aggregate survey results are shared with our advertisers and partners. We never share any survey information about specific response with any third party unless that individual consents.</font></p>

<p><font class="bodytext"><strong>New Vehicle PowerShopper and Dealer Locator Service</strong> </font></p>
<p><font class="bodytext">Our New Vehicle PowerShopper service may collect personally identifiable information about you, depending on which of our partners you select, and our Dealer Locator service does collect personally identifiable information about you if you chose to have one or more dealers contact you. The use of the information obtained by us through your use of these services is described in other portions of this Privacy Statement.</font></p>

<p><font class="bodytext"><strong>Edmunds.com's TMV<sup>®</sup> Finance Rate Estimator</strong></font></p>
<p><font class="bodytext">Edmunds.com's TMV<sup>®</sup> Finance Rate Estimator (the "Estimator") provides you with national average loan rates currently being offered by banks for new and used vehicles; requests specific information concerning your credit history and Zip Code; and then, based on that information, provides you with both (i) the local average loan rates currently being offered for new and used vehicles by lending institutions in your market, and (ii) our estimate of which "credit tier" you will qualify for when you apply for financing.
<br><br>
We do not collect personally identifying information of any kind when you use the Estimator, nor do we record or store any of the information you provide when using the Estimator. As a result, you can use the Estimator with confidence that neither us nor any other person or entity will know the answers you give or the results generated for you by the Estimator.
<br><br>
We may include in the Estimator links to partners, and the partners that are presented to you may depend on which credit tier you have been placed in by the Estimator and/or the Zip Code you provide. As a result, a partner may be aware that individuals who are referred from the Estimator have, based on the information they provided to the Estimator, been placed by us in a particular tier or are located in a particular area. However, that partner will not know your identity or the answers you give to any of the questions in the Estimator (other than your Zip Code) unless you chose to separately provide information about yourself to that partner. Partners will not make any determination to offer or deny you credit or any other product or service other than on the basis of information you separately provide to such partner. We have no control over the privacy practices or information that partner sites may request of you. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these sites.</font></p>

<p><font class="bodytext"><strong>E-mail this Page to a Friend</strong></font></p>
<p><font class="bodytext">Many of the pages of the Edmunds Web Sites include a feature that permits visitors to electronically forward that page to someone else by clicking on a link. The sender must provide his or her e-mail address, as well as that of the recipient. The sender's information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the page. Neither the sender's information nor the recipient's information is used for any other purpose.</font></p>

<p><font class="bodytext"><strong>Links to Other Web Sites</strong></font></p>
<p><font class="bodytext">The Edmunds Web Sites contain links to many other Web sites not operated by us, including sites where you can obtain automotive products and services.  However, this Privacy Policy only applies to the Edmunds Web Sites and the information we collect, and we are not responsible for the privacy polices or practices of any other Web sites.  For additional information about those links, please review our <a href="/help/about/visitoragreement.html">Visitor Agreement</a>.</font></p>

<p><font class="bodytext"><strong>Third-Party Ad Servers</strong></font></p>
