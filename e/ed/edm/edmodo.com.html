  <b>b. Use of Cookies</b>
</p>
<p>
  Edmodo LLC may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A
  cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page
  server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your
  computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web
  Server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
</p>
<p>
  One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to
  save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within
  a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on
  subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant
  content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and
  login information as well as providing personalized functionality..
</p>
<p>
  Edmodo LLC reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with partner
  companies, but does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website
  unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging into
  Edmodo LLC a site that relies on third-party cookies).
</p>
<p>
  You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
  automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting
  to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings
  then be aware that this may disable some of the functionality on our Website.

  Visitors to our website can register to purchase services. When you register,
  we will request some personal information such as name, address, email,
  telephone number or facsimile number, account number and other relevant
  information. If you are purchasing a service, we will request financial
  information. Any financial information we collect is used only to bill you for
  the services you purchased. If you purchase by credit card, this information
  may be forwarded to your credit card provider. For other types of
  registrations, we will ask for the relevant information. You may also be asked
  to disclose personal information to us so that we can provide assistance and
  information to you. For example, such data may be warranted in order to
  provide online technical support and troubleshooting.

<p>
  We will not disclose personally identifiable information we collect from you
  to third parties without your permission except to the extent necessary
  including:

  <b>4. Use of Web Beacons or GIF files</b>
</p>
<p>
  Edmodo LLC Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons –
  sometimes also called single-pixel gifs – that allow Edmodo LLC to count users
  who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Edmodo LLC
  may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order
  to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
</p>
<p>
  Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to
  help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email
  communications. These Web beacons may be used by these service providers to
  place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider
  to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and
  compile anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn
  enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and emails
  bring you to our website and how you use the site. Edmodo LLC prohibits Web
  beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.
</p>
<p>
  <b>5. Accessing Web Account Information</b>
</p>
<p>
  We will provide you with the means to ensure that personally identifiable
  information in your web account file is correct and current. You may review
  this information by contacting us by sending an email to our support attendant
  – contact@edmodo.com.

  Edmodo LLC has the discretion to occasionally update this privacy statement.
  When we do, we will also revise the “updated” date at the top of this Privacy
  page. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to stay
  informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we
  collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes your agreement to this
  privacy statement and any updates.
