	<p><b>Overview</b></p>
	<p>ED-JOIN is committed to respecting the privacy of our users. We strive
	to provide a safe, secure user experience. This Privacy Statement sets forth
	the online data collection and usage policies and practices that apply to all of
	our Web sites (<a href="http://www.edjoin.org/">www.edjoin.org</a> and <a href="http://www.edjoinadmin.org/">www.edjoinadmin.org</a> ). By using the
	ED-JOIN web site, you consent to the policies and practices described in this
	Statement.</p>
	<p>Your data will be stored and processed in the United States. If you access the ED-JOIN
	web site from outside the United States, your usage of the site
	constitutes consent to the transfer of your data out of your country and to the
	United States.</p>
	<p>Our sites contain links to other Web sites over which we have no
	control. ED-JOIN is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of
	other Web sites to which you choose to link from the ED-JOIN Web site. We
	encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other Web sites so you
	can understand how they collect, use and share your information. This Privacy
	Statement applies solely to the information we collect on the ED-JOIN Web site,
	and does not apply to information we collect in any other fashion.</p>
	<p><b>Collection and Retention of Information</b></p>
	<p>In some areas of our Web sites, ED-JOIN requests or may request that you
	provide personal information, including your name, address, e-mail address,
	telephone, social security number, contact information and any other information
	from which your identity is discernible. In other areas, ED-JOIN collects or
	may collect demographic information that is not unique to you such as your ZIP
	code, age, preferences, gender or interests. Sometimes we collect or may
	collect a combination of the two types of information. Examples of areas on ED-JOIN
	Web sites where we collect personal or combined personal and demographic data
	are the ED-JOIN Interest Card and the online Job Application.</p>
	<p>We also gather or may gather certain information about your use of our
	site, such as what areas you visit and what services you access. Moreover,
	there is information about your computer hardware and software that is or may
	be collected by ED-JOIN. This information can include without limitation your
	IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site
	addresses.</p>
	<p>Since we believe that managing your career is a life-long process, we
	retain indefinitely all the information we gather about you in an effort to
	make your repeat use with us more efficient, practical, and relevant. Of
	course, you can correct or update your ED-JOIN account profile and resume at
	any time. Moreover, you can delete your resume and profile from our online
	database or close your ED-JOIN account at any time, in which event your ED-JOIN
	account profile information will no longer be searchable by the educational
	organizations that use ED-JOIN to post jobs. An archived copy of your
	application information will still be available to districts/organizations to
	whom you have submitted your application using ED-JOIN.</p>
	<p><b>Use of Information by ED-JOIN</b></p>
	<p>We use the information we gather on the ED-JOIN Web site, whether
	personal, demographic, collective or technical, for the purpose of operating
	and improving the ED-JOIN Web site, fostering a positive user experience, and
	delivering the products and services that we offer.</p>
	<p>We may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail or other communications
	regarding updates at the ED-JOIN site, such as new ED-JOIN job postings which
	may be of interest to you. The nature and frequency of these messages will vary
	depending upon the information we have about you.</p>
	<p><b>Disclosure of Information to Others</b></p>
	<p>We do not disclose to third parties your personal information, combined
	personal and demographic information or information about your use of a ED-JOIN
	Web site (such as the areas you visit or the services you access), except as
	set forth in the following subparagraphs.</p>
	<p></p><ol><li>Educational organizations in California to whom you submit your job
     applications will have access to all of the information provided in your
     ED-JOIN job application as well as any attachments to your application.
     You’re age, gender and ethnicity information however is available only in
     aggregate form and is not viewable in connection to your individual job
     applications. These organizations may contact you using the contact
     information you provide on your job application.</li><p></p>
	<p></p><li>Educational organizations in California who use the ED-JOIN system
     to post jobs also have the ability to search the job applications in the
     ED-JOIN system. In addition, the California Teacher Recruitment Centers and the CalTeach
     organization can search the online applications as well as view aggregate
     information about the users of the ED-JOIN system. These entities may
     contact you using any of the contact information provided in your ED-JOIN
     profile or online application.</li></ol><p></p>
	<p><b>System Generated E-mail</b></p>
	<p>There are email messages that are automatically generated by the ED-JOIN system. For example,
	you should receive an email message from the system whenever you apply for a
	job on ED-JOIN. This email will contain your ED-JOIN username and password and
	will be sent to the email address in your ED-JOIN profile. In addition,
	educational organizations that use ED-JOIN can send email to you using the
	system. These email messages can also have your username and password appended
	to them. You’re ED-JOIN username and password is not viewable by the
	educational organizations that use ED-JOIN. The username and password is simply
	appended to their email message by the system when the message is sent.</p>
	<p><b>Use of Cookies</b></p>
	<p>The ED-JOIN web site uses "cookies" to help personalize your
	online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by
	a Web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to
	your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be
	read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
	<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
	feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server
	that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize ED-JOIN
	pages, or register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific
	information (such as user name, password and preferences). Because of our use
	of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more
	personalized site experience. When you return to the ED-JOIN site, the
	information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the
	features that you customized.</p>
	<p>You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
	automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting
	to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify
	your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit
	you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to
	decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact
	your experience on the ED-JOIN Web site.</p>
	<p><b>Updating Your Information</b></p>
	<p>You may review, correct, update or change your ED-JOIN account profile information at any time.
	Simply log into your ED-JOIN account, go to My Profile, review your account
	information and, if you wish, edit it with the options provided. To remove your
	profile click the “Remove My Profile” link on the ED-JOIN menu-bar.</p>
	<p><b>Security</b></p>
	<p>ED-JOIN has implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures
	designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from
	unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot
	guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those
	measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.</p>
	<p>When you place an order online at ED-JOIN, your personal information is
	protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer
	("SSL") protocol. SSL makes it difficult for your personal
	information to be intercepted while being transmitted.</p>
	<p><b>Children</b></p>
	<p>ED-JOIN is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect
	personal information from children under 13.</p>
	<p><b>Changes to Privacy Statement</b></p>
	<p>If we decide to change our Privacy Statement for ED-JOIN, we will post those changes here so that you
	will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information,
	and to whom we will disclose it. If at any time, you have questions or concerns
	about ED-JOIN's Privacy Statement, please feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:edjoin@sccoe.org">edjoin@sccoe.org</a> or
	call us at (888) 456-1468 and speak to one of our representatives.</p>
