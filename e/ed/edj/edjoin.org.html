			<p><b>Overview</b></p>
			<p>EDJOIN is committed to respecting the privacy of our users. We strive to 
				provide a safe, secure user experience. This Privacy Statement sets forth the 
				online data collection and usage policies and practices that apply to all of 
				our Web sites (<a href="http://www.edjoin.org/">www.edjoin.org</a> and <a href="http://edjoinJobs/">
					edjoinJobs</a> ). By using the EDJOIN web site, you consent to the 
				policies and practices described in this Statement.</p>
			<p>Your data will be stored and processed in the United States. If you access the 
				EDJOIN web site from outside the United States, your usage of the site 
				constitutes consent to the transfer of your data out of your country and to the 
				United States.</p>
			<p>Our sites contain links to other Web sites over which we have no control. 
				EDJOIN is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other Web 
				sites to which you choose to link from the EDJOIN Web site. We encourage you 
				to review the privacy policies of those other Web sites so you can understand 
				how they collect, use and share your information. This Privacy Statement 
				applies solely to the information we collect on the EDJOIN Web site, and does 
				not apply to information we collect in any other fashion.</p>
			<p><b>Collection and Retention of Information</b></p>
			<p>In some areas of our Web sites, EDJOIN requests or may request that you provide 
				personal information, including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone, 
				social security number, contact information and any other information from 
				which your identity is discernible. In other areas, EDJOIN collects or may 
				collect demographic information that is not unique to you such as your ZIP 
				code, age, preferences, gender or interests. Sometimes we collect or may 
				collect a combination of the two types of information. Examples of areas on 
				EDJOIN Web sites where we collect personal or combined personal and 
				demographic data are the EDJOIN Interest Card and the online Job Application.</p>
			<p>We also gather or may gather certain information about your use of our site, 
				such as what areas you visit and what services you access. Moreover, there is 
				information about your computer hardware and software that is or may be 
				collected by EDJOIN. This information can include without limitation your IP 
				address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site 
				addresses.</p>
			<p>Since we believe that managing your career is a life-long process, we retain 
				indefinitely all the information we gather about you in an effort to make your 
				repeat use with us more efficient, practical, and relevant. Of course, you can 
				correct or update your EDJOIN account profile and resume at any time. 
				Moreover, you can delete your resume and profile from our online database or 
				close your EDJOIN account at any time, in which event your EDJOIN account 
				profile information will no longer be searchable by the educational 
				organizations that use EDJOIN to post jobs. An archived copy of your 
				application information will still be available to districts/organizations to 
				whom you have submitted your application using EDJOIN.</p>
			<p><b>Use of Information by EDJOIN</b></p>
			<p>We use the information we gather on the EDJOIN Web site, whether personal, 
				demographic, collective or technical, for the purpose of operating and 
				improving the EDJOIN Web site, fostering a positive user experience, and 
				delivering the products and services that we offer.</p>
			<p>We may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail or other 
				communications regarding updates at the EDJOIN site, such as new EDJOIN job 
				postings which may be of interest to you. The nature and frequency of these 
				messages will vary depending upon the information we have about you.</p>
			<p><b>Disclosure of Information to Others</b></p>
			<p>We do not disclose to third parties your personal information, combined personal 
				and demographic information or information about your use of a EDJOIN Web site 
				(such as the areas you visit or the services you access), except as set forth 
				in the following subparagraphs.</p>
			<p>
				</p><ol>
					<li>
						Educational organizations in California to whom you submit your job 
						applications will have access to all of the information provided in your 
						EDJOIN job application as well as any attachments to your application. You’re 
						age, gender and ethnicity information however is available only in aggregate 
						form and is not viewable in connection to your individual job applications. 
						These organizations may contact you using the contact information you provide 
						on your job application.
						<p></p>
						<p></p>
					</li><li>
						Educational organizations in California who use the EDJOIN system to post jobs 
						also have the ability to search the job applications in the EDJOIN system. In 
						addition, the California Teacher Recruitment Centers and the CalTeach 
						organization can search the online applications as well as view aggregate 
						information about the users of the EDJOIN system. These entities may contact 
						you using any of the contact information provided in your EDJOIN profile or 
						online application.</li></ol>
			<p></p>
			<p><b>System Generated E-mail</b></p>
			<p>There are email messages that are automatically generated by the EDJOIN system. 
				For example, you should receive an email message from the system whenever you 
				apply for a job on EDJOIN. This email will contain your EDJOIN username and 
				password and will be sent to the email address in your EDJOIN profile. In 
				addition, educational organizations that use EDJOIN can send email to you 
				using the system. These email messages can also have your username and password 
				appended to them. You’re EDJOIN username and password is not viewable by the 
				educational organizations that use EDJOIN. The username and password is simply 
				appended to their email message by the system when the message is sent.</p>
			<p><b>Use of Cookies</b></p>
			<p>The EDJOIN web site uses "cookies" to help personalize your online experience. 
				A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a Web page server. 
				Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. 
				Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a Web 
				server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
			<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to 
				save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have 
				returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize EDJOIN pages, or 
				register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information 
				(such as user name, password and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, 
				we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site 
				experience. When you return to the EDJOIN site, the information you previously 
				provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you 
				customized.</p>
			<p>You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers 
				automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting 
				to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify 
				your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit 
				you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to 
				decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact 
				your experience on the EDJOIN Web site.</p>
			<p><b>Updating Your Information</b></p>
			<p>You may review, correct, update or change your EDJOIN account profile 
				information at any time. Simply log into your EDJOIN account, go to My 
				Profile, review your account information and, if you wish, edit it with the 
				options provided. To remove your profile click the “Remove My Profile” link on 
				the EDJOIN menu-bar.</p>
			<p><b>Security</b></p>
			<p>EDJOIN has implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures 
				designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from 
				unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot 
				guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those 
				measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.</p>
			<p>When you place an order online at EDJOIN, your personal information is 
				protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer 
				("SSL") protocol. SSL makes it difficult for your personal information to be 
				intercepted while being transmitted.</p>
			<p><b>Children</b></p>
			<p>EDJOIN is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly 
				collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
			<p><b>Changes to Privacy Statement</b></p>
			<p>If we decide to change our Privacy Statement for EDJOIN, we will post those 
				changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we 
				might use that information, and to whom we will disclose it. If at any time, 
				you have questions or concerns about EDJOIN's Privacy Statement, please feel 
				free to email us at <a href="mailto:edjoin_helpdesk@sbcss.k12.ca.us">edjoin_helpdesk@sbcss.k12.ca.us</a>
