<p>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU? WHY?</p>
<p>We May Profile Users Pseudononymously</p>
<p>We may build a pseudononymous profile of your online habits, interests and

browsing patterns, and we use these profiles for the purposes described below
(please scroll down to each topic for details). </p>
<p>We May Collect Information Needed to Contact You Later:</p>
<p>If we collect personal contact information (as described below), you may later
access it, however, you may not modify or remove it from our system yourself.</p>
<p>We May Collect Your Name, Address and Phone Number. When you use our Site,
we may request your name, street address, telephone number or other "real world" contact
information. This information may reveal your identity or be linked to you

<p>We May Collect Other Kinds of Information from You:</p>
<p>When you use our Site, we may collect personal information about you described
below. You may not later be able to access, modify or remove the information.</p>
<p>You May be Prompted for a UserID and Password. We may ask you to enter a web

use this information to complete and support the immediate activity requested,
and to comply with any requirements of law. This information may be disclosed

of law. This information may be disclosed only to our staff and to our immediate

<p>We May Collect Navigation and Clickstream Data. As you browse our Site, we
may gather navigational and clickstream data that shows what pages are visited
and how long various features are used. This information will not reveal your

requirements of law. This information may be disclosed only to our staff and

<p>CERTAIN EXCEPTIONAL DISCLOSURES</p>
<p>We may disclose your information if necessary to protect our legal rights
or if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct. Disclosure

<p>WHAT ARE COOKIES? WHY DO WE USE THEM?</p>
<p>Cookies are small files stored by your browser in your computer when you visit
our Site. We use cookies to improve our Site and make it easier to use. Cookies
permit us to recognize users and avoid repetitive requests for the same information.
We also use cookies to help build a pseudonymous profile of your online habits,
interests and activities as you navigate our site, which we use for general
research, analysis and reporting. We mostly use "session cookies" that are
automatically deleted after each visit. Cookies from our Site can't be read
by other sites. Most browsers will accept cookies until you change browser
settings to refuse them.</p>
<p>HOW DO WE PROTECT INFORMATION WE COLLECT? </p>
<p>We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and
we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical
and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and
integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely
secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Site reduce the likelihood
of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.</p>
<p>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP USER INFORMATION?</p>
<p>We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for about two
(2) years. We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For
example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We may
keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In addition, information
posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely. </p>
<p>Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent
feasible and within our direct control. Note: we have greater control over
recently collected data than for archived data. Once data is removed from the
system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests.
In those cases, our general data retention policy applies.</p>
<p>YOUR CONSENT TO THIS POLICY</p>
<p>By using our Site, you agree to this Policy. This is our entire and exclusive
Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. We may change it by posting
a new version on our Site.</p>
<p>LEGAL DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>THIS SITE OPERATES AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE. ANY WARRANTIES OF ACCURACY, QUALITY,
TITLE, FITNESS OR MERCHANTABILITY ARE DISCLAIMED. WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR DIRECT,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR FOR EVENTS BEYOND OUR DIRECT
CONTROL.</p>
<p>This Policy is governed by Massachusetts law, excluding conflicts of law principles.
Any provision of this Policy that is illegal or unenforceable shall be deemed
automatically conformed to the minimum requirements of law. Any legal actions
against us must be commenced in Massachusetts within one year after the claim
arose, or be barred.</p>
