Public users are defined as those users who have not yet registered their profile, but who may nonetheless use some of the functions of the application, such as, for example, the search function.</p> <p>The information provided by users, such as the information required for the registration of a Quag.com account, may be used by Quentral to improve the user experience, for example, by allowing users to receive e-mail notifications regarding the Quag.com service.</p> <p>We invite all users to read the detailed Statement that follows. In order to complete the registration process on Quag.com and to use the services offered to registered users, said users must give their consent to the processing of their personal data, pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 196/2003.</p> <p>Users give their consent by creating an account and/or by accessing the site. We nonetheless urge users to carefully read this document and the documents relating to the&nbsp;<a href="/en/page/terms/" title="Terms and conditions">Terms and Conditions</a>&nbsp;of Use of the Service.</p> <p>After completing the registration process on Quag.com, registered users may access Member Services and publish content within their personal online profile (including, but not limited to, images, a list of their interests, their gender, nationality, etc.). Such content shall be added voluntarily and at the sole discretion of users, based on their own personal choices and under their exclusive responsibility.</p> <p>We also wish to inform users – inviting them to take due account of this aspect before making any decision regarding the following – that, by publishing content on the website, they may, even unconsciously provide and disclose additional personal information. The publication of said content (and any personal information that may result or emerge from this content, directly or indirectly) is, in any case, a personal choice freely made by users, entirely of their own volition, with regard to which Quentral is totally extraneous and for which it declines all liability; such choices are made exclusively under the personal responsibility of the user concerned.</p> <h4>Data collected</h4> <p>Upon registration, Quag.com asks users for their personal and identification data, i.e. e-mail address and a password that will become the password to access the service; we remind users that they can also register with Quag.com using their facebook, twitter and/or Google+ profile. By clicking on one of the buttons linked to the social networks in the registration/access window of Quag.com, users will be redirected to the login page of the selected social network, through which, after entering the proper credentials, they will be registered automatically on Quag.com. The registration process cannot be completed without this information and thus users will not be able to become registered users of Quag.com, and it will not be possible for them to use the services Quag.com reserves for its members (for more details about Quag.com services, we recommend reading the&nbsp;<a href="/en/page/terms/" title="Terms and conditions">Terms and Conditions</a>&nbsp;of Use of the Service).</p> <p>As part of providing its service, Quentral also collects information on which and how services are used by its users, both registered and public (not registered).</p> <p>This information includes:</p> <ol> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Information on the device used:</strong> 1. we may collect specific information about the devices used by users to connect to the Quag.com service, (e.g. hardware model, type and version, operating system, browser type and language setting).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Log information:</strong> the&nbsp;log file is a file in which the actions users make during their Quag.com service session are recorded.When users access our services, we collect and store certain information automatically in server logs.

When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognise your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information.

We remind users that the e-mail confirming their registration contains personal information, and as such will never be given to third parties for marketing or commercial purposes.</p> <p>We remind users, furthermore, that they can also register with Quag.com by using their facebook, twitter and/or Google+ profile. By clicking on one of the buttons linked to the social networks in the registration/access window of Quag.com, users will be redirected to the login page of the selected social network, through which, after entering the proper credentials, users will be registered automatically on Quag.com.</p> <p>It is important to remember that the information users choose to share publicly may be indexed by other search engines.</p> <p>Quentral reserves the right to use and exploit all present and/or future applications and/or technologies liable to increase the distribution of the site and its related contents.</p> <h4>Quentral's methods of processing personal data</h4> <p>In conformity with the provisions of article 11 of Legislative Decree no. 196/2003, the personal data of users will be processed lawfully and fairly and will be stored in a form that allows users to be identified for a period of time not exceeding what is necessary for the purposes for which they were collected and subsequently processed.
