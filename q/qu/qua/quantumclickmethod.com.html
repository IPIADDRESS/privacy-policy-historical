  <p align="left" class="style5"><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="style5">Last Updated: March 22, 2011</p>
  <p align="left" class="style5">Quantum Click Method.com strives   to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to   provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use   Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street   address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy.   We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any   unauthorized third party. Period.”</p>
  <p align="left" class="style5"><strong>How we gather information from users</strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="style5">How we collect and store   information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in   which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example,   you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to   certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as   newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information   when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and   chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web   sites, Quantum Click Method.com also collects information automatically and   through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our   visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service   Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information   from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name   and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each   time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a   particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional   technology, we may also gather information through other means. In   certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for   example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you   do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be   asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to   customize the site’s features according to your preferences.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style5"><strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="style5">Like other Web publishers,   we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more   individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do   not share your information with anyone.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style5">Aggregated Information   (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many   ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns   with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our   site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what   features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally   be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this   information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information   about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style5">We may use Personally   Identifiable Information collected on millionaireprofitsecrets.com to   communicate with you about your registration and customization   preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and   products offered by Quantum Click Method.com and other topics we think you might   find of interest.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style5">Personally Identifiable   Information collected by millionaireprofitsecrets.com may also be used   for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration,   troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration   of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain   third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our   site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information.   We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from   time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy,   merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such   transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We   may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at   other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law,   in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or   to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or   necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to   disclosure in such cases.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style5"><strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="style5">Quantum Click Method.com expects   its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our   users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our partners,   advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through   our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and   practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link to,   or view as part of a frame on a Quantum Click Method.com page, certain content   that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through Quantum Click Method.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access,   information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by   other parties.

  <p align="left" class="style5">While on our site, our   advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies   or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or   retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is   served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the   advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement   before. Other features available on our site may offer services   operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to   gather information. Quantum Click Method.com does not control the use of this   technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not   responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style5">You should also be aware   that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on   message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly   and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge   and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third   parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Quantum Click Method.com and   this policy.</p>
