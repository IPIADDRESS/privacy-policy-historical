	<h3 class="standardPopupMargin">We Value Your Privacy</h3>

	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
	Increasingly, online shoppers give out personal information reluctantly, knowing that they'll probably 
	get bombarded with phone and e-mail advertising. Well, QualitySmith is different. We consider it an 
	honor that you are willing to give us information about yourself. We share your personal information 
	only with prescreened QualitySmith partner contractors so that they can provide estimate appointments.
	</div>
	
	<h3 class="standardPopupMargin">TRUSTe Participation</h3>
	
	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
	To demonstrate our commitment to privacy, QualitySmith is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program, 
	and has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for 
	compliance by TRUSTe. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build 
	user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This 
	privacy statement covers the domain www.qualitysmith.com and its subdomains.

	If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact QualitySmith by clicking

	<h3 class="standardPopupMargin">Our Privacy Policy in a Nutshell</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Your privacy is very important to us.</li>
		<li>We don't collect personal information without your knowledge - i.e. we ask for it in a form and you submit it.</li>
		<li>We use cookies and beacons only for statistical analysis to improve our sites and to make our sites easier to use for return visitors.</li>
		<li>In the highly unlikely event that we're required to by a court order, we have to give up personal information. Otherwise, it's kept under the tightest security possible.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Our Privacy Policy in Detail</h3>
	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		<b>Privacy and Information Gathering</b>
	</div>

	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		The privacy of our customers has always been of utmost importance to us at QualitySmith. 
		We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet 
		business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure 
		the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web 
		beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site (first party cookies). 
		A cookie is a small packet of information stored on a user's computer that allows a website 
		server to know certain information about a user, for example, how many times a user has visited 
		the site. A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic placed on a site or in an email that 
		allows a site to record, for example, whether a page was accessed or an e-mail opened, for statistical 
		analysis. Our cookies and Web beacons are not tied to personally identifiable information.
	</div>

	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		<b>Anonymous Information</b>
	</div>

	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		Information gathered using log files includes, but is not limited to, the activity of the 
		user's browser when user is viewing the site, the site path of visitors, and the time visitors 
		come to our site. Please note that this is not personal information, only general summaries of 
		our visitors, and log files are not tied to personally identifiable information. By supplementing 
		our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our 
		visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers 
		like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, 
		we control how that data may and may not be used. Our marketing company may not use any of the 
		information gathered for their own marketing purposes.

	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		<b>Legal Disclaimer</b>
	</div>

	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and 
		when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial 
		proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site
	</div>
	
	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		<b>Communications From the Site</b>
	</div>

	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		As described above, you will receive a telephone call from a QualitySmith representative to discuss 
		your inquiry upon submission of your request for an estimate for any of our services. In addition, 
		we send an email to you after completion of each estimate appointment requesting that you complete 
		a survey about your experience and the appointment quality. The completion of this survey is strictly 
		voluntary. You may not opt-out of receiving these critical service communications.
	</div>
	
	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		<b>Service From Third-Party Sites</b>
	</div>

	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		When no QualitySmith partner contractors are available to provide estimates, your information will be 
		transmitted to one of our trusted corporate partners for assistance in finding contractors in your area 
		to serve you. At that point, you'll be notified of the name of that company and begin to receive e-mail 
		and phone communications from them regarding your contractor choice. Once contacted by our corporate partner, 
		you'll have the opportunity to opt out of their non-transactional e-mail and phone communications and your 
		personal information will be governed by their privacy policy/terms and conditions.
	</div>
	
	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		<b>Links to Other Sites</b>
	</div>

	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by QualitySmith. Please 
		be aware that QualitySmith is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. This 
		privacy statement applies only to information collected by this website.
	</div>
	
	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		Please note that when you link to our Affiliates program from our site you will be on a third party 
		domain called www.sharasale.com.  Any personally identifiable information collected on their site is 
		subject to their privacy policy.

	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website 
		that collects personally identifiable information.

	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		<b>Testimonials</b>
	</div>

	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		We use testimonials on this site that are collected both offline and with an e-mailed survey that 
		links to an online form. We receive permission to post testimonials prior to posting. In addition, if 
		you would like your testimonial removed for any reason, please contact us by clicking

		We will abide by your preferences with regards to the sharing of this information.
	</div>
	
	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		<b>Information Storage and Access</b>
	</div>

	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		The information is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data and is provided 
		only to contractors who have been evaluated and accepted as QualitySmith partner contractors. It is not 
		provided to any other parties. QualitySmith uses secured server areas and advanced firewall technology to 
		minimize the risk of individually identifiable information being compromised. QualitySmith also takes every 
		effort to ensure that the information users provide is correct and current. Though we make every effort to preserve 
		user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law, wherein we have a good-faith 
		belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order, or legal process 
		served on our website.
	</div>
	
	<div class="standardPopupMargin">
		Though you cannot access the personally identifiable information that is collected on the site to correct or update 
		the information online, you may discuss these changes with the QualitySmith representative that calls you to follow 
		up on your inquiry. You may also email us
