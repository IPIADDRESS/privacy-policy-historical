<p><strong>Revision date: December 16, 2019</strong></p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Qualaroo provides an online user research platform for use in collecting and analyzing user experience information for websites and other software applications and online services. Most of our customers are business entities or other organizations. Qualaroo’s main office is in San Antonio, Texas and it offers its services to customers worldwide.</p>



<p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies for personal data that we collect and use for our own general business purposes.</p>



<p>We also have personal data in our possession that our customers have collected using our services and asked us to process for them. We use this customer-controlled data only as permitted by our customers in our agreements with them and not for our own general business purposes. We have included information below to describe our commitments to you if we have access to your data in our role as a service provider, but you should review the privacy policy of our customer that controls your personal data to understand its privacy practices.<br></p>



<h3>How to Contact Us</h3>



<p>Email: support@qualaroo.com or via mail: Qualaroo – 122 East Houston St, San Antonio TX 78205.</p>



<p>Please contact us if you have any questions about the information in this Privacy Policy or our handling of your personal data, or would like to access, correct, delete, restrict our use, or take other action with regard to your personal data. We ask, however, that if we are in possession of your data solely as a service provider for our customer you first contact our customer with your request.</p>



<h3>Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>



<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will manage your personal data in accordance with the Privacy Policy version that was published on the date that we collected the data about you. Prior versions of our Privacy Policy may be found at https://qualaroo.com/privacy-policy-legacy-12-16-19.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Definitions</h3>



<p>These words have special meanings in this Privacy Policy:</p>



<ul><li><strong>account user</strong> means an individual who interacts with us as a representative of our customer;</li><li><strong>customer</strong> means the business or other organization that establishes an account with us or our reseller for the use of our services;</li><li><strong>end user</strong> means an individual who views or interacts with our customers’ website, software, online service, or other technology or digital publication;</li><li><strong>services</strong> means the Qualaroo automated user research platform;</li><li><strong>“site”</strong> or <strong>“website”</strong> refers to www.qualaroo.com and any other website where this Privacy Policy is posted;</li><li><strong>“visitor”</strong> means an individual who visits the Qualaroo website or social media pages, visits our offices, interacts with us at a trade show or other industry event, or communicates with us in some other way other than as an account user or end user, or whose information is provided to us by a marketing services vendor as an individual who might be interested in purchasing our services;</li><li><strong>“we”</strong>, <strong>“our”</strong> and <strong>“us”</strong> refer to Qualaroo, Inc.;</li><li><strong>“you”</strong> and <strong>“your”</strong> refer to visitors, account users, and end users, as indicated by the context.</li></ul>



<h2>Data Collection Purposes</h2>



<p>We collect personal data for the following business purposes:</p>



<ul><li>to operate our website;&nbsp;</li><li>to improve our website and product offerings;</li><li>to market our services;</li><li>to manage our relationship with our customers, including account administration;&nbsp;</li><li>to provide our online services to our customers;&nbsp;</li><li>to provide customer support; and</li><li>to manage our vendors.</li></ul>



<p>We allow third party advertisers, such as Google Ads to collect personal data on our site for the purpose of selling targeted advertisement services.&nbsp; See <strong>Advertising Ecosystem</strong> and How to <strong>Opt Out of Online Date Collection</strong> below.</p>



<h3>Data Collection Methods</h3>



<h4>Automated data collection on our website and online services platform</h4>



<p>When you visit our site or use our online services platform, our servers capture data that may be used to identify you or your device, such as&nbsp; your IP address, device identifier, and information about your device such as the operating system, time zone setting, language setting, browser settings, and browser plug ins.&nbsp; Our servers may also capture information about your visit to our site or services platform, such as the referring site, time and duration of your visit on each page on the site, and your navigation path from page to page (i.e., what you click on). We may use third-party service providers to capture other information about your site visit, such as recordings of your scrolling activity.</p>



<p>We and our third-party analytics providers may place a cookie on your browser so that we may identify you as a return visitor if you visit our site more than once.&nbsp; Please see <strong>How to Opt Out of Online Data Collection</strong> below for information on how to block cookies. </p>



<h4>Data provided by advertisers</h4>



<p>If you arrive at our site by clicking on a link that is part of an online advertisement (including an advertisement on a social media platform), the advertising service will identify the link, enabling us to associate you with the advertising parameters we provided to the advertising service.&nbsp; For example, we may ask an advertising service to target our ad to individuals who the ad service has identified as having a high interest in user experience research. If you arrive at our site by means of the link in that ad, we will be able to identify you as having a high interest in user experience research. Advertising services are responsible for the collection, use and disclosure of the data they provide to us in accordance with their published privacy policies.&nbsp; See the section below captioned <strong>Advertising Ecosystem</strong> and <strong>How to Opt Out of Online Data Collection</strong>. </p>



<h4>Data provided by you as part of your communications with us</h4>



<p>We collect personal data that you submit to us as part of a communication with us as a visitor or account user, such as via chat on our site, email, submission of a web form, telephone, or in person (such as at a meeting, trade show or other event).&nbsp; For example, you may communicate with us as a visitor to obtain more information about our services, or as an account user to request technical support.  The communication may include information that can be used to identify you such as your name, job title, job function, the organization you represent, email address, phone number as well as information about your interest in our company or our services.&nbsp; We do not solicit information from you as part of these communications other than information that is useful to us in light of the purposes described above, but if you choose to volunteer more personal information than we ask for we will collect that as part of the communication. </p>



<h4>Data provided by you or your organization to establish and maintain the Qualaroo account</h4>



<p>Our customers are required to name billing, administrative, technical and other types of service and account users who have authority to use our services and manage the customer’s account. We collect the name and business contact information of these account representatives, and will require each individual account representative to establish their own set of account credentials (user name and password). If the customer wishes to integrate our services with other online services, we may need the customer to provide the account credentials used by their representatives on those platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you use a personal payment card or other financial account to make payment arrangements, then we may collect information relevant to the processing of the payment transaction.<br></p>



<h4>Marketing Vendors, Partners, and Resellers</h4>



<p>We may develop relationships with other companies that help us market, sell and deliver our services.&nbsp; They may collect personal data of the type described above using the methods described above and provide that data to us. &nbsp; For example, we may develop relationships with companies who refer customers to us and resellers who offer our services under the reseller’s own brand name.&nbsp; We will treat personal information we receive from our marketing partners and resellers the same as the personal information we collect directly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We may elect to purchase information from marketing vendors who provide names and other identifying and contact information of individuals who meet criteria we provide for marketing leads.<br></p>



<h4>Combinations of data collected using different methods</h4>



<p>We may use service providers such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Segment, and HubSpot to help us associate the personal data we capture about you as part of visitor interactions with personal data we collect about you as an account user.</p>



<p> We do not associate data about visitors or account users with personal information we have about you as an end user.</p>



<h3>Data Use</h3>



<p><strong>Visitor</strong>s:&nbsp; We use data collected about visitors:</p>



<ul><li>to operate our website – web servers, by their nature, must capture your IP address and information about your browser and device to display our site to you;&nbsp;</li></ul>

<h3>Advertising Ecosystem</h3>



<p>We may use online advertising services that enable a practice referred to as “online behavioral advertising.” These services aggregate data about an individual’s behavior on many different sites and online services, and use that data to sell targeted advertising services. For example, we permit Google’s advertising services to collect data about your behavior on the Qualaroo Site, as do many other website operators who use Google’s ad services. Google combines the data about an individual that it collects from different sources, and uses this aggregate data to sell advertising services that target the display of ads to web users who meet certain behavioral criteria. Google does not disclose this aggregate data to Qualaroo, but we are able to infer that users who interact with our ad meet the advertising criteria we provided. Google collects this data using cookies, web server logs (its own and its advertising customers), clear gifs and other online data collection techniques. See Online Data Collection Techniques and How to Opt Out of Online Data Collection.</p>



<h2>Online Data Collection Techniques</h2>



<p>A cookie is a unique alphanumeric identifier that is placed by a web server on the web visitor’s browser. Cookies are used to analyse visitors’ use of the website. For example, a website operator can use the cookie to identify the number of unique visitors to the site, whether or not those visitors are repeat visitors, and information about the visitor’s activity on the site, device and device settings. A tracking pixel, also known as a web bug or web beacon, is a small graphic (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) invisible to the eye, that is embedded in web content or email. When content that has an embedded web beacon is viewed, the browser will request content from a web server, which in turn will set a cookie.<br></p>



<h2>How To Opt Out Of Online Data Collection</h2>



<p><strong>Visitors can opt out of all but essential cookies using this Cookie Opt Out feature: </strong>https://qualaroo.com/cookie-opt-out/<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>You can also manage browser cookies through your browser settings. The ‘Help’ feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, how to disable cookies, and when cookies will expire. If you disable all cookies on your browser, neither we nor third parties will transfer cookies to your browser. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some features and services may not work.</p>



<p>Our servers do recognize and respond to the “do not track” setting you may have in your browser.</p>



<p>The third parties who we permit to collect data on our site have features that allow you to block their data collection via cookies. See their privacy policies and cookie policies:</p>



<p>Google Ads: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?/hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;hl=en">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?/hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;hl=en</a></p>



<h2>Communications Policy</h2>



<p>If you do not wish to receive our email or other communications, please send your request to support@qualaroo.com. Please note that it may take up to ten days to remove your contact information from our marketing communications lists, so you may receive correspondence from us for a short time after you make your request.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>



<p>Qualaroo protects personal data from unauthorized use, disclosure, corruption and destruction using appropriate technical and organizational measures.<br></p>



<h2>Data Retention</h2>



<p>We will retain your personal data only for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, and to comply with our legal obligations, and will use a secure means to destroy the data after that time. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.<br></p>
