You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a  cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You also can set  your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Web sites may not  work properly. For example, we may keep track of the domains from which people  visit, and we may also measure visitor activity.</p>

For website  security purposes, and to ensure that our website remains available to all  visitors, all network traffic is monitored in order to identify unauthorized  attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage or conduct  criminal activity.
