		<p><strong><u>Privacy Policy:</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>Changes to this Policy</strong> <br>
				This Privacy Policy may occasionally change. Any Policy changes
						will be posted on this page. Each version of this policy will be denoted
						at the top of this page by its effective date.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br>
				We, at Interactive Brands, respect your right to privacy and
				we are committed to protecting it.<br>
				This statement discloses the information that we gather and track,
				how we use the information, and with whom we share this same information.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
				You can visit any of our Web sites without indicating who you
				are, and without revealing any personal information about yourself. If you
				choose to buy from this Web site, we ask you to provide basic information
				such as your First Name, Last Name and e-mail address. This will be used
				to set up your private account, your invoice, and to send your purchase confirmation.
				Your personal information will NEVER BE DISCLOSED OR SHARED WITH ANY THIRD
				PARTY without your explicit consent. If you <u>do not</u> wish to receive
				marketing communications from us or participate in our customization programs,
				simply indicate your preference once you sign onto this Web site.<br>
		<br>
				Transaction information such as credit card details, billing
				addresses and/or phone numbers are required to purchase and activate your
				membership. If you provide us with personal information or credit information
				about somebody else, such as a family member, friend or associate, we will
				assume that you have their permission to do so.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Fulfilling your Transaction Request</strong><br>
				To fulfill your requests (i.e. access to customer’s area, technical
				support, etc.), you must allow us to use your personal information to identify
				you as a client.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Information Security</strong><br>
				We intend to protect your personal information and maintain its
				integrity. To help us do this, we have implemented appropriate measures and
				processes, such as SSL encryption when transmitting sensitive information.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Cookies and Other Web Technologies</strong><br>
				To help us provide better customer service, we sometimes collect
				non-identifiable information from visits to our Web sites. For example, we
				may keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we may also measure
				visitor activity. We may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and
				to help us provide better customer service.<br>
		<br>
				We collect the aforementioned information through the use of
				various technologies, including so-called "cookies". A cookie is
				a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then
				be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer
				without disclosing your personal information. Some of our pages use cookies,
				and other technologies to better serve you when you return to the Web site.
				You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, allowing
				you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. You can also set your
				browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Web sites may not
				work properly. <br>
		<br>
		<strong>Security, Intrusion, and Detection</strong><br>
				For Web site security purposes, and to ensure that our Web site
				remains available to all visitors, all network traffic is monitored in order
				to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, cause
				damage, or conduct criminal activity. To protect the system from unauthorized
				use and to ensure that the system is functioning properly, individuals accessing
				our Web sites are subject to monitoring. Unauthorized attempts to upload
				or change information, or otherwise cause damage to this service are strictly
				prohibited and may be punishable under applicable federal law.<br>
				<br>
				
				<strong>Aggregated tracking information</strong><br>
		  We analyze visitors use of our sites by tracking information such as pageviews, 
		  traffic flow, search terms, and click through. We use this information to improve our sites. 
		  We do not share any information with third part companies that can identify an individual user.
		  We use a third party web analytics service to improve our web site performance and user experience. 
		  We use this information to improve usability on our sites and to help support our customers online needs. 
		  The tracking system does not reveal any personally identifiable information, such as names or email address.
