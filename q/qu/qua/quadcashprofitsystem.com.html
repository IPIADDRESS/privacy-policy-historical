Notification of Changes</a> <br>
____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><b>I. Notice</b> </p>
<p>The “Website” refers to the website or webpage at 
www.quadcashprofitsystem.com, its subdomains, and related domains or sales 
pages. This Website is owned or operated by Secret Headquarters, Inc and/or its 
subsidiary companies in the United States of America (collectively, “<span class="caps">COMPANY</span>”). 
This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to information that you provide 
to <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> via this Website, and/or by use of other 
services (collectively, the “Services”) that may be provided by other means or 
media, including as set forth below and as defined in the applicable
<a href="http://www.quadcashprofitsystem.com/terms_and_conditions.htm">Terms and Conditions</a> or other 
terms.<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you notice of COMPANY’s information 
management practices, including the types of information gathered, how it is 
used and safeguarded, and the degree to which you may control the maintenance 
and sharing of your information. Your use of any <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> 
Service or Website constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy and any other 
applicable terms. This Privacy Policy is part of and incorporated by reference 
into the <a href="http://www.quadcashprofitsystem.com/terms_and_conditions.htm">Terms and Conditions</a> for 
this Website.<br>
<br>
II. Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect <br>
<br>
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> respects your privacy and is committed to 
protecting personally identifiable information that you provide in connection 
with your use of its Websites and Services. Such personally identifiable 
information collected includes your name, shipping address, billing address, 
telephone numbers, e-mail address, and payment information such as your credit 
card number.<br>
<b><br>
<span class="caps">III</span>. E-mail Newsletter Subscriptions</b> <br>
<br>
To subscribe to our e-mail newsletters, if any, you will need to provide your 
e-mail address. You may also be asked for other information when you subscribe.<br>
<b><br>
IV. User Accounts</b> <br>
<br>
In order to use our chat rooms, message boards, and certain other Services, you 
will need to register and create a user account (“User Account”). There is no 
cost to create a User Account in most cases. You may be asked to choose a user 
name, screen name, or member name (each, a “User Name”) and password. Please do 
not use your real name or the real name of another person when selecting a User 
Name. You will also be asked to provide certain personally identifiable 
information and other information about yourself, such as your first and last 
name, date of birth, address, telephone number, and e-mail address.<br>
<br>
Please note that your User Name will be available to the Internet’s general 
public while you participate in some Services, like chat rooms, forums or 
message boards, so you should exercise discretion when using these Services. 
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may disclose publicly 
in such Services. In some instances, you may choose to create a “Public Profile” 
that will be available to others on the Internet. Public Profiles are managed 
entirely by you, and you are solely responsible for your Public Profile’s 
content and its “public” or “private” status. The Company bears no 
responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any 
information that users may disclose in user forums or other public areas of this 
Website. You are also responsible for maintaining and updating the registration 
information in your User Account with current and complete information. You may 
access, edit or remove your Public Profile by signing in to your User Account 
and following the directions there. You can also send an e-mail to
<a href="mailto:quadcashsupport@gmail.com">quadcashsupport@gmail.com</a> to 
request deactivation of your User Account. <br>
Please review our restrictions on use and guidelines for user forums in the 
“Terms and Conditions” for the Website.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;You can unsubscribe from receiving commercial e-mail from the Website by 
clicking the link contained within such e-mails sent to you. You should be aware 
that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our 
databases. In addition, we may institute a policy in which user information is 
deleted after a certain amount of time, and therefore, your user information may 
no longer exist in the COMPANY’s active database(s). In addition, even if you 
choose to unsubscribe or otherwise modify your User Account settings, the
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> reserves the right to contact you regarding 
your account and your use of this Website.<br>
<b><br>
V. Special Promotions and Purchases; Submission of Content to be Published</b>
<br>
<br>
To participate in some Services such as sweepstakes, contests and surveys 
(“Special Promotions”), or to make online purchases (“Purchases”), you will need 
to provide personally identifiable information, such as name, mailing address, 
e-mail address, phone number, and date of birth. Your information may be 
collected by <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> or by a third party, such as a 
co-sponsor or a vendor involved in, or providing services in connection with, a 
Special Promotion, or an e-commerce partner in the case of a Purchase.<br>
<br>
If you make a Purchase or enter a sweepstakes or other Special Promotion on one 
of our sites or through our Services, <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> will 
collect your personally identifiable information, and you are deemed to consent 
to us providing your information to third parties who provide certain services 
such as processing of credit card transactions, customer service, promotion or 
sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment and/or prize delivery, as 
applicable. (As more fully described below in “Use, Disclosure, and Sharing of 
Information – Personally Identifiable Information”, these third parties are 
prohibited from using this information for their own marketing purposes and/or 
from sharing, selling, or otherwise distributing any personal data of our 
customers, unless you choose to opt in for such additional uses and/or 
disclosure by the third parties, under their respective privacy policies.).&nbsp; 
Also, by entering a sweepstakes or other Special Promotion, you are agreeing to 
the official rules that govern that sweepstakes or other Special Promotion, 
which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where 
prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the promotion to use your name, 
voice or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the promotion.<br>
<br>
If you make a purchase or enter a promotion (such as a sweepstakes) in which
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> is participating on a third party’s website 
(or through some other means or medium), we will collect your information from 
the third party only if you opt-in to receive additional communications from us, 
or we are required to fulfill some function in relation to your activity (e.g., 
to send your order or deliver a prize).<br>
<br>
If you submit to the Website a comment, photograph or other content to be 
published, online or offline (including on-air, in a <span class="caps">DVD</span>, 
or any other format), we may publish your name or other personally identifiable 
information in connection with publishing the content and you are hereby deemed 
to give us permission to do such.<br>
<b><br>
VI. Information Collected by Other Means or Media</b> <br>
<br>
In some situations, we may also collect personally identifiable information and 
other information about you through other means, directly or indirectly. For 
example, if you access any <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> content, or 
purchase such content via your wireless carrier or through another third party, 
the <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> may collect information directly from you 
or through the third party. Likewise, if you use our software, or provide 
information to other companies who share information about their customers, we 
may collect additional information about you. In each of these cases, the
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> will apply this policy to any personally 
identifiable information.<br>
<b><br>
<span class="caps">VII</span>. Information About Other People<br>
</b><br>
Some <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> Websites and Services may ask you to 
submit personally identifiable information about other people. If you provide us 
with personally identifiable information of a friend, or your friend provides 
personally identifiable information about you, to e-mail a feature from the 
Website, the e-mail addresses you or your friend supply us for those activities 
will not be used to send you or your friend other e-mail communications unless 
disclosed at the time you provide the information. A record of that transaction 
will be maintained as allowed and/or required by law.<br>
<b><br>
<span class="caps">VIII</span>. Customer Service</b> <br>
<br>
Some Services may offer support and technical assistance through customer 
service centers via telephone, online chat, or e-mail. Whenever you communicate 
with customer service, you do so with the understanding that an operator may 
view and make changes to the information in your User Account in order to 
provide the assistance that you need.<br>
<b><br>
IX. Non-Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect</b> <br>
<br>
As part of the registration process for some Services, you may be asked to 
provide information that does not personally identify you. For example, you may 
be asked to provide information concerning your personal preferences, purchasing 
habits, and the like. This information is generally optional but may be included 
in your User Account profile. <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> requests this 
information to understand you better and to also bring to your attention new 
services, programs, or offers that may be of interest to you.<br>
<br>
In many cases, <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> will automatically collect 
certain non-personally identifiable information about your use of its sites and 
Services. <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> might collect, among other things, 
information concerning the type of Internet browser or computer operating system 
you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your “click 
path” through the <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> sites or “click-through” 
from an e-mail, the Website or advertisement that was linked to or from the
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> site when you visited, and your IP address. To 
do this, <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> may use cookies and other technology 
(see below). If you are using our wireless Services, we may also automatically 
collect information such as the type of wireless device you are using, your 
mobile identification number (assigned by your telecommunications carrier) and 
telecommunications carrier. Your use of our Websites and Services, and 
information provided through these technologies, will be anonymous unless you 
provide us with personally identifiable information or have provided such 
information in the past.<br>
<b><br>
X. Cookies and Related Technology</b><br>
<br>
This Website’s pages or e-mail messages may contain cookies, web beacons (also 
known as clear gifs), or similar technologies as they become available. Cookies 
are information files that this Website may place on your computer to provide 
extended functionality. The <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> may use cookies 
for a number of purposes, such as tracking usage patterns on the Website, 
measuring the effectiveness of advertising, limiting multiple responses and 
registrations, facilitating your ability to navigate the Website and as part of 
a verification or screening process. Most browsers are initially set up to 
accept cookies. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer 
hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is 
stored. You should refer to your browser instructions, “Help” screen, or similar 
such resource to learn more about how to manage cookies and possibly reset your 
browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent by 
indicating this in the preferences, options, or similar such menu in your 
browser. However, it is possible that some parts of this Website will not 
operate correctly if you disable cookies and you may not be able to take 
advantage of some of this Website’s features. You should consult with your 
browser’s provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling 
cookies. <br>
<br>
The COMPANY’s web pages may include advertisements for third parties and their 
products, and those third-party advertisements may include a cookie or web 
beacon served by the third party.&nbsp; The <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> 
does not control cookies in such third party ads, and visitors are encouraged to 
check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about 
their use of cookies and other technology. The COMPANY’s Privacy Policy does not 
cover the use of information collected from you by third party ad servers. These 
companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address 
or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Websites in order to 
provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services 
that may be of interest to you. &nbsp;<br>
A web beacon is a small graphic image that allows the party that set the web 
beacon to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of the web 
page, web-based document or e-mail message, such as the type of browser 
requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is 
sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small 
and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part 
of a web page or e-mail, including <span class="caps">HTML</span> based content, 
can act as a web beacon. The <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> may use web 
beacons to count visitors to the web pages on the Website or to monitor how our 
users navigate the Website, and the <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> may 
include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many messages sent 
were actually opened, acted upon or forwarded. <br>
<br>
<b>XI. Special Notice Regarding Children Under 13</b> <br>
<br>
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> recognizes the sensitivity of personally 
identifiable information concerning children under the age of 13 and therefore 
provides this special notice. <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> is committed to 
complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding children, including 
the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<span class="caps">COPPA</span>”). 
Except in limited circumstances allowed by <span class="caps">COPPA</span>,
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> will not knowingly collect, maintain, or 
disclose any personally identifiable information from a child under 13 without 
first obtaining consent from that child’s parent or legal guardian.<br>
<br>
If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child under the age 
of 13 has submitted his or her personally identifiable information without your 
permission or consent, <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> will make reasonable 
efforts to remove the information from its active list, at your request. To 
request the removal of your child’s information, please send an e-mail to
<a href="mailto:quadcashsupport@gmail.com">quadcashsupport@gmail.com</a> and be 
sure to include in your message the same User Name and password and/or e-mail 
address that your child submitted.<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> encourages parents and guardians to spend time 
online with their children to become familiar with the types of content 
available on the <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> Web sites and the Internet 
generally.<br>
<br>
<span class="caps"><b>XII</b></span><b>. Use, Disclosure, and Sharing of 
Information</b> <br>
<br>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Non-Personally Identifiable 
Information</b><br>
From time to time, <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> may use and share with 
third parties aggregate, non-personally identifiable user information to show 
general demographic and preference information among users of the
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> Web sites. &nbsp;When you visit or download 
information from this Website, our web servers may automatically collect website 
usage information. Website usage information is non-personally identifying 
information that describes how our visitors use the Website. It can include the 
number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length of their stays, 
browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and 
subsequent to visiting the Website, and IP addresses (see below for more 
information on IP addresses). <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> may use IP 
addresses for a number of purposes, such as system administration, to generally 
determine your computer’s server location, to report aggregate information to 
our business partners or to audit use of the Website. We also may determine your 
screen resolution and the technology available in order to serve you the most 
appropriate version of a web page, e-mail or similar service.<br>
<br>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
b. Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> uses information about you to deliver the 
Services that you request, to keep you informed about changes affecting our 
Services or your account, to inform you of other Services or offers in which you 
might be interested, and to improve and enhance our sites and Services. If you 
provide <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> with personally identifiable 
information, we will take all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect it 
from unauthorized disclosure.<br>
If you opt in to receive e-mail from us, you can always opt out of future 
marketing messages by following the directions in each message to “unsubscribe”. 
However, if you choose to opt out of marketing messages, we reserve the right to 
contact you regarding your account status, technical support, product 
information, changes to account terms, and any other matter that might affect 
our service to you and/or any products you purchased from us or registered with 
us, as applicable.<br>
As stated in the Terms and Conditions, you will be deemed to have consented to 
the disclosure to, and use by, a subsequent owner or operator of a
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> Website or Service, of any information about 
you contained in the applicable <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> database, if
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> or one of its companies assigns its rights and 
obligations regarding any of your information at the time of a merger, 
acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of COMPANY’s or such
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> company’s assets related to the applicable 
site or Service to a subsequent owner or operator. In the event of such a 
merger, acquisition, or sale, your continued use of the Website or any related 
Service signifies your agreement to be bound by the Terms and Conditions and 
Privacy Policy of the Website’s or Service’s subsequent owner or operator.<br>
<br>
The <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> and its companies may work together in 
order to provide portions of the <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> Websites and 
some Services (e.g., to fulfill prizes won in a sweepstakes, or to provide other 
support for a Service). These companies will handle your personally identifiable 
information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br>
As stated above in <b>Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect – 
Special Promotions and Purchases; Submission of Content to be Published</b>,
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> may also work with third parties to provide 
some Services on our Websites. In connection with those Services, you are deemed 
to consent to us sharing your information with third parties who provide 
services such as processing of credit card transactions, customer service, 
promotion administration, order fulfillment and/or prize delivery, as 
applicable. <br>
<br>
Third parties who provide, or participate in, Services on <span class="caps">
COMPANY</span> Websites are prohibited from using our customers’ personally 
identifiable information for marketing purposes and/or from sharing, selling, or 
otherwise using such information, unless you choose to opt in to marketing, 
sharing, or other uses by the third parties. If you do not want your information 
to be used for marketing (or other purposes unrelated to the provision of
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> Services) by a third party who participates in 
a Service on one of our sites, do not opt in to such use by that third party 
when you register to participate in the Service.<br>
Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a 
third party, your information will be subject to the third party’s privacy 
policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your 
information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no 
control over how third parties use information. You should always review the 
privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that 
entity will handle your information.<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> will not share, sell, rent, or disclose any 
personally identifiable information that we have collected except as stated 
herein, or in the following instances; 1) where we supply companies we have 
associations with, with your information in order to offer you services we feel 
may be of interest to you and who may then contact you by telephone or direct 
mail (unless you have opted out of their marketing programs under the procedures 
set forth by them; 2) where we are required by law, legal process, or court 
order to disclose; 3) where disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or 
bring legal action against someone who may cause or be causing harm to, or 
interference with, the COMPANY’s rights or property, other <span class="caps">
COMPANY</span> Website users, or anyone else; or 4) to respond to an inquiry, 
request or complaint that you have made. <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> may 
also use IP addresses it collects in cooperation with Internet service 
providers, to identify users if we deem it necessary to comply with law, to 
enforce compliance with this Privacy Policy or our Terms and Conditions, or to 
protect our sites, customers, or others.<br>
<br>
<span class="caps"><b>XIII</b></span><b>. Our Commitment to Data Security</b>
<br>
<br>
While <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> takes reasonable and appropriate 
precautions to protect your personally identifiable information from 
unauthorized disclosure and to prevent possible security breaches in our 
Websites, Services, and customer databases, no website, Internet transmission, 
computer system, or wireless connection is completely secure. Consequently,
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, 
hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. Your use of the
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> Websites and Services is at your own risk.
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> urges you to take steps to keep your 
information safe by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place 
(separate from your account information), logging out of your User Account, and 
closing your Web browser.<br>
<br>
Whenever you give <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> sensitive or confidential 
information (for example, credit card numbers for Purchases), <span class="caps">
COMPANY</span> will take commercially reasonable steps to protect the 
information by establishing a secure connection with your Web browser.
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> employs a security technology known as a 
secure-socket-layer (“<span class="caps">SSL</span>”) to protect the 
transmission of payment information to the site. Unless otherwise specified 
herein or on the Website where you make a Purchase, credit card numbers are used 
only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes.<br>
<b><br>
<span class="caps">XIV</span>. Hyperlinks To and From Other Sites</b> <br>
<br>
<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> sites may frame, and/or contain links to, or 
advertisements about, non-<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> Web sites. Other 
sites may also reference, advertise, or link to <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> 
Websites. <span class="caps">COMPANY</span> does not endorse or sponsor other 
websites, is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of non-<span class="caps">COMPANY</span> 
sites, expressly disclaims any statements or assertions made on such websites, 
and denies and disclaims all liability associated with your use of, and the 
content on, such other sites and advertisements.<br>
<br>
<b>XV. Consent to Processing in the United States</b> <br>
<br>
By providing any personally identifiable information to <span class="caps">
