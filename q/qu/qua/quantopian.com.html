If we later learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Site and the Services.</p>
<h3>4. Types of Information We Collect.</h3>

When we refer to "<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>" we mean information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information.

<h4>Information Collected via Technology.</h4>
<ul>
<li>To make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), and domain name.</li>
<li>
<p>We also use cookies and URL information to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, the website URL you were visiting immediately before you came to our Site and the website URL you visit as you leave our Site and the information for which you searched and which you viewed. "<strong>Cookies</strong>" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s web browser while you are viewing a website.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.  Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions; please note that certain aspects of the Site or Services may not be available if the Persistent Cookies are removed.</p>
</li>
<li>We may use third party service providers to help us analyze certain online activities. For example, these service providers may help us analyze visitor activity on the Site. We may permit these service providers to use cookies and other technologies to perform these services for us.</li>
<li>If you are logged into the Site or Services, the information collected via technology as described in this Section may be associated with your Personal Information and will, accordingly, be treated as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>5. Our Relationship with Social Networking Sites</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We have created and may offer you interfaces that allow you to connect with social networking websites such as Facebook ("<strong>SN Site</strong>") through our Site. We will work with the SN Site’s application protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows you to authorize us to access your account on that SN Site on your behalf.  In order to provide this authorization, you will not provide us with your user name or password to the SN Site, but you will need to log-in to that SN Site directly through our Site. Once authorized by you, the SN Site will provide us a token that allows the SN Site to recognize us when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account information or to post information. You will be able to revoke our access to any SN Site at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SN Site, though such revocation may limit the Services we are able to provide you.</p>
<h3>6. Use of Personal Information</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>
<h4>Your Personal Information.</h4>
In general, Personal Information you submit to us regarding you or your company is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better.  We use such Personal Information in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>to publish such Personal Information to Visitors and other Members of the Site and Services, but only when you make such Personal Information available in public areas of the Site and Services</li>
<li>to facilitate communication with other Members of the Site and Services that you designate to receive your Personal Information when you communicate with them through the Site and Services</li>
<li>to facilitate the creation of and secure your Account on our network;</li>
<li>to identify you as a user in our system;</li>
<li>to provide improved administration of our Site and Services;</li>
<li>to provide the Services you request;</li>
<li>to improve the quality of experience when you interact with our Site and Services;</li>
<li>to send you a welcome e-mail to verify ownership of the e-mail address provided when your Account was created;</li>
<li>to send you administrative e-mail notifications, such as security or support and maintenance advisories;</li>
<li>to respond to your inquiries related to employment opportunities or other requests;</li>

<li>to send newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials related to our Services and for other marketing purposes;</li>
<li>to share with other organizations to help them contact you for marketing purposes; and</li>

We may allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements and we may use any of the attributes we have collected (including information you do not make publicly available on the Site) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Creation of Anonymous Information.</strong>  We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as the name) that makes the information personally identifiable to the data subject.  We use this Anonymous Information to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our Services and improve Site navigation.  Quantopian reserves the right to use Anonymous Information for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Information to third parties in its sole discretion.  </p>
