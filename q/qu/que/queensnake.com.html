    </div>
    
    <span>
      We use personal data for a number of purposes, including the following:    
    </span>

    <ul>
      <li>help you resetting your password</li>

      <li>To comply with applicable laws and regulations</li>
    </ul>

    <div>
      <b>Legal grounds for using your personal data</b>
    </div>
    
    <span>
      We will only use your personal data where we have a legal ground to do so. We determine the legal grounds based on the purposes for which we have collected and used your personal data. In every case, the legal ground will be one of the following:

      <ul>
        <li>Consent: For example, where you have allowed to use cookies</li>
        <li>Our legitimate interests: For example, we will rely on our legitimate interest when we analyse what content has been viewed on our sites</li>
        <li>Performance of a contract with you: For example, where you have purchased a subscription from us and we need to use your contact details in order to process your order and deliver your subscription</li>
        <li>Compliance with law: In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to use or keep your personal data</li>
      </ul>
    </span>
    
    <div>
      <b>Updating your personal data and your profile page on our sites</b>
    </div>

    <span>
      When you sign up for an account, you have access to your profile page. Under "account" (cogwheel icon) you can review your information and preferences. You can also update your information or preferences if you want.
    </span>

    <div>
      <b>Security of your personal data</b>
    </div>
    
    <span>
      We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational controls to protect your personal data against unauthorised processing and against accidental loss, damage or destruction. You are responsible for choosing a secure password when we ask you to set up a password to access parts of our site. You should keep this password confidential and you should choose a password that you do not use on any other site. You should not share your password with anyone else, including anyone who works for us. Unfortunately, sending information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data once with us, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal data sent to our site while still in transit and so you provide it at your own risk.
    </span>

    <div>
      <b>Who we share your personal data with</b>
    </div>

    <span>
      We do not share your personal data with other people or organisations that are not directly linked to us except under the following circumstances:

      <ul>
        <li>We may share your data with other organisations that provide services on our behalf such as dealing with online payments and other forms of payment processing, ie credit card transactions and preventing fraud</li>
        <li>We may also share your data with our advertising partners, as set out in the section about Online Advertising below</li>
        <li>We may reveal your personal data to any law enforcement agency, court, regulator, government authority or other organisation if we are required to do so to meet a legal or regulatory obligation, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of anyone else</li>
        <li>We may reveal your personal data to any other organisation that buys, or to which we transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and business. If this sale or transfer takes place, we will use reasonable efforts to try to make sure that the organisation we transfer your personal data to uses it in line with our privacy policy</li>
      </ul>
      
      We will not share your personal data with anyone else for their own marketing purposes.
    </span>

    <div>
      <b>International data transfers</b>
    </div>

    <span>
      Data we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed in any country or territory where one or more of our service providers are based or have facilities. While other countries or territories may not have the same standards of data protection as those in your home country, we will continue to protect personal data that we transfer in line with this privacy policy.
    </span>

    <span>
      Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the European Economic Area (EEA), we ensure similar protection and put in place at least one of these safeguards:

      <ul>
        <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been found to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.</li>
        <li>We may also use specific approved contracts with our service providers that are based in countries outside the EEA. These contracts give your personal data the same protection it has in the EEA .</li>
        <li>Where we use service providers in the United States, we may transfer personal data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield scheme, which requires them to provide a similar level of protection of your personal data to what is required in the EEA.</li>
      </ul>
    </span>
          
    <div>
      <b>How long we keep your personal data</b>
    </div>
    
    <span>
      We keep your personal data for only as long as we need to. How long we need you personal data depends on what we are using it for, as set out in this privacy policy. For example, we may need to use it to answer your queries about a product or service and as a result may keep personal data while you are still using our product or services. We may also need to keep your personal data for accounting purposes, for example, where you have bought a subscription. If we no longer need your data, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you. If we have asked for your permission to process your personal data and we have no other lawful grounds to continue with that processing, and you withdraw your permission, we will delete your personal data.
    </span>
    
    <div>
