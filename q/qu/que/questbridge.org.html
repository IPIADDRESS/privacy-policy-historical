<h2>8. Data retention and deletion</h2>

<p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the QB Website and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the QB Website, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless, we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data.</p>

<p><a name="keeping"></a></p>

<h2>9. Keeping your personal data safe</h2>

<p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect the security of your personal data; however, please note that no system is ever completely secure. We have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorized access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.</p>

<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a unique and strong password, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the QB Website.</p>

<h2>10. Children</h2>

<p>The following sets forth the QB Website information gathering and dissemination practices relating to information collected from children. The QB Website is not intended for use by children under age thirteen (13). No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any Personal Information. As a result, we do not knowingly solicit Personal Information from children and do not ask them to disclose such information, other than that information necessary to determine their age.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a child is between 13 and 16, they may use our website only with a parent's or guardian's consent and only to the extent such parent or guardian has agreed to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. We advise parents to discuss with their children restrictions regarding the disclosure of personal information on the Internet. If a child is between 13 and 16 and is located in the European Union, we are required by the General Data Privacy Regulations (“GDPR”) to obtain parental consent if the student is applying to programs which necessitate the sharing of data with our partners, including but not limited to the CPS Programs and the College Match.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we may knowingly collect and use a child's personal information for the sole purpose of responding to a single request by the child.</p>
