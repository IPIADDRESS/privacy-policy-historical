Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site. We, our advertisers and ad serving companies may also use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to determine which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them.</p> <p><b>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</b></p> <p>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering and expanding our business activities, providing customer service and making available other products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers by contacting us.</p> <p><b>What Are Cookies?</b></p> <p>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.</p> <p><b>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</b></p> <p>As you browse our Web site, the site uses its cookies to differentiate you from other visitors so your user session is only available to you. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from seeing unnecessary advertisements or requiring you to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not generally store any personal information that you provided to us in your cookies.</p> <p><b>Sharing Information with Third Parties</b></p> <p>We may enter into alliances, partnerships or other business arrangements with third parties who may be given access to personal information including your name, address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to you. In connection with alliances, partnerships or arrangements, we may also provide certain information to third parties if we have determined that the information will be used in a responsible manner by a responsible third party. We also use third parties to facilitate our business, including, but not limited to, sending email and processing credit card payments. In connection with these offerings and business operations, our partners and other third parties may have access to your personal information for use in connection with business activities. As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or any dissolution.</p> <p><b>Notice of New Services and Changes</b></p> <p>Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. As our customer, you will be given the opportunity to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers by sending us an email request.</p> <p><b>Certain Disclosures</b></p> <p>We may disclosure your personal information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law or comply with legal process served on us or Affiliated Parties; (b) protect and defend our rights and property, the Site, the users of the Site, and/or our Affiliated Parties; (c) act under circumstances to protect the safety of users of the Site, us, or third parties.</p> <p><b>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</b></p> <p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site.</p> <p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Web site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other Web site, including Web sites which have a link on our Web site, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p> <p><b>Your Consent</b></p> <p>By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our Web site to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose</p> </div> </div> <div class="clearall mb"></div> &nbsp; <div class="bottom_row"><div><div> QuestionHub gathers questions from leading sites , helping you to quickly and effectively find answers. </div></div></div> </div> </div> <div class="footer"> <a href="http://www.questionhub.com"><img src="http://www.questionhub.com/images/logo_footer.jpg" alt="QuestionHub.com" class="logo" border="0"></a> <div class="menu"> <a href="http://www.questionhub.com">Home</a> | <a href="http://www.questionhub.com/ask-a-question.cfm">Ask A Question</a> | <a href="http://www.questionhub.com/about-us.cfm">About Us</a> | <a href="http://www.questionhub.com/contact-us.cfm">Contact</a> | <a href="http://www.questionhub.com/privacy-policy.cfm">Privacy Policy</a> <span class="copy">©2013 QuestionHub.com</span> </div> <!-- Start of StatCounter Code --> <script type="text/javascript"> sc_project=3772299; sc_invisible=1; sc_partition=40; sc_security="f69c666e"; </script> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js"></script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><a href="http://www.statcounter.com/free_hit_counter.html" target="_blank"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c41.statcounter.com/3772299/0/f69c666e/1/" border="0" ></a></div></noscript> <!-- End of StatCounter Code --> </div>
