<p>We make every effort to preserve user privacy, however we may need to

  in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Quepublishing.com 
  collects information from our users at several different points on our 
  website.</p>
<p>Pearson Education recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy 
  of Personal Identifying Information about you as a user of our Web site. 
  We consider the following information Personal Identifying Information: 
  your e-mail address, name, password, mailing address, and credit card 
  information. This Web site does not collect Personal Identifying Information 
  about a user other than information that is voluntarily provided to our 
  Company; in this way, we can serve the user's needs as well as our own 
  legitimate business purposes. (For example, we retain the Personal Identifying 
  Information that a user provides when he or she registers with Quepublishing.com, 
  part of the InformIT Network.)</p>
<p>Our company uses a user's Personal Identifying Information in order to 
  help us improve our Web site, or for our company's marketing and promotional 
  purposes if you have opted to receive these kinds of communications. This 
  information will be treated confidentially within our company. While our 
  policy is not to share this information with third parties, we do share 
  aggregate information with other companies within Pearson Education, Inc.</p>

<p>Que is a member of the InformIT Network. InformIT (<a href="http://www.informit.com" target="_blank">www.informit.com</a>) 
  is also part of the Pearson Education family, and follows the same privacy guidelines 
  outlined herein. InformIT is a member of TrustE, an online privacy verification

<p><strong>Registration</strong></p>
<p>In order to receive certain services pertaining to this site, you must 
  register. During registration a user is required to provide his or her 
  e-mail address. This e-mail address is used to contact the user about 
  the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is 
  optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as your 
  job, technical interests, etc.), but encouraged so we can provide personalized 
  services to the user, and learn more about our customers in aggregate.</p>
<p><strong>Order</strong></p>
<p>We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must 
  provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial 
  information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information 
  is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have 
  trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in 
  touch with the user.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive tied to aggregate 
  information about the user. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie 
  simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the 
  user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving 
  time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use 
  our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in 
  some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target 
  the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.</p>
<p><strong>Log Files</strong></p>
<p>Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet 
  protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), 
  referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks 
  to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, 
  and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, 
  etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. </p><p><strong>Sharing</strong></p>
<p>We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and 
  advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify 
  any individual person.</p>
<p>We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods 
  and services. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally 
  identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>
<p>We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the 
  user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact 
  information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. 
  These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information 
  except for the purpose of providing these services.</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we 
  (Quepublishing.com) are not responsible for the privacy practices of such 
  other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site 
  and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects 
  personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely 
  to information collected by this Web site.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletters</strong></p>
<p>Upon registration a user has the option to receive Que and InformIT newsletters. 
  The user may opt-out of these at the time of registration, and never receive 
  a newsletter from Quepublishing.com thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>Service Announcements</strong></p>
<p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related 
  announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for 
  maintenance we might send users an e-mail. Generally, users may not opt-out 
  of these communications, though they can remove their account information. 
  However, these communications are not promotional in nature. </p>
<p><strong>Customer Service</strong></p>
<p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services 
  and in regard to issues relating to their account we reply via e-mail 
  or phone in accordance with the users wishes when a user submits their 
  information through our Feedback and Comments form.</p>
<p><strong>Surveys and Contests</strong></p>
<p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys 
  or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely 
  voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose 
  this information. Information requested may include contact information 
  (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such 
  as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the 
  winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes 
  of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. 
  When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information 
  is protected both online and off-line.</p>
<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information 
  (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected 
  with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure 
  page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers 
  such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, 
  as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just "surfing". </p>
<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, 
  we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. 
  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned 
  above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information 
  to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer 
  service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable 
  information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security 
  and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies 
  are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance 
  we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information 
  is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable 
  information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can 
  send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:mel@informit.com">mel@informit.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Correction/Updating Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your 
  e-mail address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide 
  a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided 
  to us. This can usually be done at the "account management page" or by 
  e-mailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:mel@informit.com">mel@informit.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong></p>
<p>Users of our site are always notified when their information is being 
  collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an 
  informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require 
  an outside party, or not.</p>
<p>If you choose to remove yourself from our mailing list(s) simply visit 
  the following page and uncheck any communication you no longer want to 
  receive:<br>
  <a href="/my_account/index.asp">http://www.quepublishing.com/my_account/index.asp</a></p>
<p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong></p>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes 
  on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, 
  how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at 
  any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner 
  different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify 
  users by way of an e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not 
  we use their information in this different manner. However, if you have 
  removed your personal information you will not be contacted, nor will 
  your information be used in this new manner. We will use information in 
  accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p></div><div id="footer" style="clear:both; "><div id="footerNav"><ul><li class="about"><a href="/about/index.asp">About</a></li><li class="legal"><a href="/about/legal.asp">Legal Notice</a></li><li class="privacy"><a href="/about/privacy.asp">Privacy Policy</a></li><li class="press"><a href="/press/index.asp">Press</a></li><li class="jobs"><a href="/about/jobs.asp">Jobs</a></li><li class="write"><a href="/about/write_for_us.asp">Write For Us</a></li><li class="contactUs"><a href="/about/contact_us/index.asp">Contact Us</a></li><li class="advertise"><a href="/about/advertise.asp">Advertise</a></li><li class="siteMap"><a href="/site_map/index.asp">Site Map</a></li></ul></div><p class="copyright">© 2004 Pearson Education, Que Publishing.
