                <h3>How We Use This Information</h3>

                <p>The information that is automatically collected by this web
                site allows 
<!--THIS MUST BE SAVED WITHOUT THE DYNAMIC QuoteWizard AND INSTEAD WITH THE NAME OF OUR WEBSITE-->
QuoteWizard.com
 LLC to further develop and improve the
                layout, design, and usability of the site, in order to better
                serve your Internet needs. Information you provide to us is
                used for marketing purposes, and may result in follow-up
                communications.</p>

                <p> 
<!--THIS MUST BE SAVED WITHOUT THE DYNAMIC QuoteWizard AND INSTEAD WITH THE NAME OF OUR WEBSITE-->
QuoteWizard.com
 LLC may share personally identifiable information
                with insurance agents and insurance carriers for the purposes
                of providing quotes.</p>

                <h3>How Our Insurance Partners May Use This Information</h3>

                <p>IMPORTANT: All proposed named insured listed on this
                application must be made aware of the following:</p>

                <p>In order to provide you with the most accurate quotes
                possible, insurance companies may need to obtain additional
                background information about you. As an example Consumer
                reports may be ordered in connection with your insurance
                application. These reports provide information that may assist
                in determining your eligibility for insurance and the price you
                may be charged. Consumer reports may also be used for updates,
                renewals or extensions of this insurance. The insurance company
                may also obtain and use a credit-based insurance score based on
                information contained in your credit report. The insurance
                company may use a third party in connection with the
                development of the insurance score.</p>

                <h3>Your Rights—Our Obligations</h3>

                <p>The company respects the privacy of users visiting our sites
                and will abide by all applicable laws concerning the release of

                via direct mail or email, about products and services, or
                updates and other information that we think may be of interest
                to you. We may share this information with our insurance
                partners to bring similar information to your attention. If you
                tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a
                basis for further contact with you, we will respect your
                wishes. Please contact us to request that your name and address
                should be removed from our lists. <strong>If you do not want to

                against the loss, misuse, and/or alteration of the information
                under our control.</p>

                <h3>Why We Use "Cookies"</h3>

                <p>When you visit some of our sites, we use cookies to keep
                track of your information. A "cookie" is a small piece of
                program code that resides on your computer and stores your
                contact information for all of our "Request Information" sites.
                Each time you visit our site, the cookie uses the stored
                information to pre-populate our online forms, so that you do
                not have to re-enter your contact information as you move from
                one site to another.</p>

                <h3>Links From Our Site To Other Sites</h3>

                <p>Some of our sites may contain links to other sites external
                to our sites. When you access these external web sites, the
                providers of the sites will have access to certain information

                <h3>Definitions</h3>

                <h3>Cookies</h3>

                <p>Data created by a web server that is stored on a user's
                computer. A cookie provides a way for the web site to keep
                track of a user's patterns and preferences and, with the
                cooperation of the Web browser, to store them on the user's own
                hard disk.</p>

                <p>The cookies contain a range of URLs (web addresses) for
                which they are valid. When the browser encounters those URLs
                again, it sends those specific cookies to the Web server. For
                example, if a user's ID is stored as a cookie, it saves that
                person from typing in the same information all over again when
                accessing that service for the second and subsequent time
                during the same browser session.</p>

                <p>You can opt out of the use of cookies by having your browser
                disable cookies or warn you before accepting a cookie. Look for
                the cookie options in your browser in the Options or
                Preferences menu.</p>

                <h3>IP (Internet Protocol) Address</h3>

                <p>This is the address of a computer attached to a TCP/IP
                network. Every client and server station must have a unique IP
                address. Client workstations have either a permanent address or
                one that is dynamically assigned for each dial-up session. IP
                addresses are written as four sets of numbers separated by
                periods; for example, 204.171.64.2.</p>

                <h3>Browser Session</h3>

                <p>A browser session is defined as the period of time a browser
                is in consecutive use. The session begins when you open the
                browser and ends when you close it. When you re-open the
                browser, you begin a new session.</p>

                <h3>SSL Encryption (Secure Sockets Layer)</h3>

                <p>The leading security protocol on the Internet. When an SSL
                session is started, the browser sends its public key to the
                server so that the server can securely send a secret key to the
                browser. The browser and server exchange data via secret key
                encryption during that session. QuoteWizard also uses SSL
                encryption whenever we display your personal information (e.g.
                name and address).</p>

                <h3>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</h3>

                <p>An Internet address. URLs are used to locate sites on the
                Internet and to navigate between sites and pages within sites.
                The URL for QuoteWizard is http://QuoteWizard.com.</p>
