<h3><a name="a_1"></a>WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO</h3>

</p><h3><a name="a_7"></a>LINKS</h3>
<p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Company is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Company even in cases where we may frame another site with our own. From time to time we may co-brand certain services with third parties. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting such information and whose privacy statement governs. For example, without limiting the foregoing, we co-brand with insurance brokers, credit reporting agencies and, automotive companies.</p>

<h3><a name="a_8"></a>SECURITY</h3>
<p>We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
