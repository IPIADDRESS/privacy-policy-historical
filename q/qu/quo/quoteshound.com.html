<h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p>This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for QuotesHound.com.</p>

<h3><a name="a_1"></a>WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO </h3>
<p>QuotesHound.com ("Company " or "we" or "our" or "QuotesHound"), owns and operates the website located at www.quoteshound.com, (the "Site"). Through the Site, Company operates a prospective customer data base (the "Service"), by which it compiles, sorts and sells contact information to businesses on behalf of individual consumers who have shown an interest in applying for a business' products or services and has affirmatively asked to be contacted by a representative of a product or service business. Company utilizes third party vendors, third party affiliates, and a variety of media advertisements to promote the Site to consumers interested in completing an online contact request at our Site or to supplement our database by purchasing their database of consumers who have completed applications on websites other than Company's and have affirmatively requested receipt of information about product or service offerings similar to those offered on Company's Site.</p> 

<h3><a name="a_2"></a> YOUR PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT TO US</h3>
<p>We recognize the importance of protecting your personal information.

</p><h3><a name="a_7"></a>LINKS</h3>
<p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Company is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Company even in cases where we may frame another site with our own. From time to time we may co-brand certain services with third parties. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting such information and whose privacy statement governs. For example, without limiting the foregoing, we co-brand with insurance brokers, credit reporting agencies and, automotive companies.</p>

<h3><a name="a_8"></a>SECURITY</h3>
<p>We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. When we transmit highly confidential information over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>

<h3><a name="a_9"></a>DISCLOSURE</h3>
