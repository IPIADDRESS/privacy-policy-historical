<p>Overall privacy</p>

<p><span class="new_trust_privacy">Commitment</span><br>
<br>
 Toluna SAS is an online data collection company focused on
providing high quality data to the full-service marketing research
industry, advertising agencies and consultancies. We build and
maintain large online consumer Panels. You can be assured your
privacy and the confidentiality of your information is our number
one priority. All of the data that Toluna SAS collects in our
research studies report as aggregate information, that is,
information about groups - not individuals. Individual information
is never reviewed or published without your consent, as it is
irrelevant to the research conducted by our clients. All individual
information provided is held confidential in accordance with the
terms of this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
 <span class="new_trust_privacy">The Information We
Gather</span><br>
<br>
 Toluna SAS gathers personal information when an individual
registers to become a member of our panels. Your participation in
any of our panels and surveys is voluntary. After registration we
ask panel members to provide us with more personal information so
that we may invite them to appropriate surveys. To become a panel
member, we ask that you fill out a registration survey that gathers
some personal and general consumer information. We ask for your
email address so that we can send you email invitations to
participate in our upcoming surveys. The other information we
gather, such as your name, address, gender, birthday, and
employment status, is for matching you with the appropriate
marketing research projects. Your birthday is used to automatically
update your age for us to target age-related marketing groups. We
ask you for this information as a means to see if you might qualify
for particular projects. All email contact from Toluna SAS will be
sent to your primary email address that you gave to us upon
registration. If you become a panel member, your information (name,
address, city, state, and zip) is also used for the purposes of
incentive fulfilment. When incentive points are deposited in your
account and you wish to redeem them, this information is required
so that we may send your reward to the appropriate recipient
address. From time to time, a third party may be used for issuing
checks or processing the delivery of rewards; your personally
identifiable information will not be used for any other reason, but
to mail you your reward.<br>
<br>
 In some circumstances, Toluna SAS may ask you to inform us of your
sensitive personal data, unless we are permitted to process such
sensitive personal data by law, we will ask for your consent. In
general sensitive data that may be collected by Toluna SAS may
cover: your racial or ethnic origin; your political opinions; your
physical or mental health or condition; and your sexual life. This
information is not shared with any third party, except as required
by law and as part of a transfer of Toluna SAS's business.<br>
<br>
 If you take a survey or provide us with personal information
without being a member of our panel, the only personally
identifiable information we will preserve is your email address,
gender, age, ethnicity and zip code, machine ID and IP address. We
do this so we may contact you if you have won a prize or are
entitled to an incentive, to match you to appropriate surveys and
improve the user experience. Unless you elect to become a member of
the Toluna SAS panel, we will not contact you for any reason other
than to notify you that you have won a prize or are eligible for an
incentive. If you are entitled to a prize or an incentive, we will
collect and maintain such personally identifiable information, as
we are required to maintain or report by virtue of any law or
regulation.<br>
<br>
 If you use the Community Forum Area on our website to post blogs,
bulletins or chat with fellow community members, you should be
aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there
can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and
could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not
responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose
to submit in these forums.<br>
<br>
 <span class="new_trust_privacy">Use of This
Information</span><br>
<br>
 Toluna SAS does not sell or transfer the personally identifiable
information collected about the members of its panels or the
individuals that take surveys for us. Information which is
personally identifiable will only be transferred with your prior
permission on a case by case basis, except for the narrow
exceptions specified below. If you are a member of the Toluna SAS
panel, your information is stored in our proprietary database so we
may call upon it to determine which people match up with specific
research studies. If we think your profile makes you a potential
candidate for a study, we will email you an invitation to make you
aware of this opportunity. From time to time Toluna SAS may use
third-party software for email list management and email
distribution, or may use third party list management providers to
match the members of our Panel to members of other lists or panels,
or to validate accuracy of personal information you provide. We may
use third parties to provide us with data they have collected about
you, and append this data to your demographic profile. In such
cases only a minimum amount of information is transferred to these
third parties so as to enable them to perform specific functions on
our behalf. We also may share your information with our service
providers, such as to provide prizes you have won or other
incentives for your participation in our panels.<br>
<br>
 Your information may be transferred to other countries, including
the United States. All such transfers shall solely be made in
accordance with applicable law.</p>

<p><span class="new_trust_privacy">The Use of Cookies and Local
Shared Objects on Our Site and Digital Finger printing</span><br>
<br>
 <span class="new_trust_privacy">Cookies</span>: One or more
"cookies" will be placed on the hard disk of the computer(s) used
by site visitors, panelists and survey takers in order to allow
Toluna SAS to recognize the participant when they connect to the
Toluna website, in order to facilitate the management of Toluna
SAS, for statistical purposes (pages consulted, date and time of
consultations etc.), and to enable us to provide the participant
with surveys specifically tailored to his / her interests. This
will not affect the performance of your computer but simply provide
you with additional opportunities to receive more surveys relevant
to your interests.<br>
<br>
 Only information collected by cookies as specified in this section
of our privacy policy is automatically collected from users of the
Site. In the event that we do collect any personal data about
visitors to the Site it is available only to Toluna SAS.<br>
<br>
 By the use of the Site all Site users authorize cookies to be put
in place and their use by Toluna SAS and Toluna SAS's clients and
business partners. The cookies will expire after one year.<br>
<br>
 Site users may disable the installation of "cookies " or to delete
cookies installed by Toluna SAS or its clients. To do so you should
modify your browser settings click on the help section of your
Internet browser and follow the instructions.<br>
<br>
 <span class="new_trust_privacy">Local Shared Objects</span>: In
order to enhance your experience as a panel member and to increase
your opportunities to participate in surveys, Toluna would like to
install an application on your computer that will collect limited
data about certain websites you visit and certain advertisements
that are displayed to you during your website browsing. The
application consists of an HTML cookie and local shared object
(LSO).<br>
<br>
 The application will signal when you visit a website that utilizes
a participating internet advertising network. The signal emitted
from the application identifies tags contained in certain on-line
advertisements relating to our clients. It will update us when you
interact with these ads so we can send you relevant surveys for you
to complete. This will not affect the performance of your computer
but simply provide you with additional opportunities to receive
more surveys relevant to your interests.<br>
<br>
 In addition, it will be possible for clients to determine on which
site the specific advertisement was viewed. We provide only limited
non-personally identifiable information to our clients, including
certain demographic information and a coded user identification
number so that your personal information will not be tied to your
browsing data. In addition, in the event of a merger or other sale
of Toluna or its client or as required by applicable law, the
anonymous data collected by the application may be shared with
third parties.<br>
<br>
 LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and
type of data stored and how the data are stored. Cookie management
tools provided by your browser and many anti-spyware applications
will not remove Flash cookies, nor will the "Private Browsing"
modes on your browser prevent their placement on your computer. You
can, however, manage privacy and storage settings for local shared
objects or disable their use entirely by visiting the website of
Macromedia, the manufacturer of Flash Player, at the following
link:<br>
 <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">
http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html</a><br>
<br>
 Please note that the local shared object may restore a deleted
HTML cookie in order to keep the application functioning
properly.<br>
<br>
 If in the future you change your mind about participating in the
application program, please contact: <a href="mailto:privacyna@toluna.com">privacyna@toluna.com</a>.<br>
<br>
 We will record your preference not to participate in the
application. We and our client take commercially reasonable efforts
to keep your data secure, including technical, physical and
administrative safeguards. For example, all of our storage servers
are protected by firewalls.<br>
<br>
 <span class="new_trust_privacy">Digital Finger printing</span>: In
general, digital fingerprinting technologies assign a unique
identifier or "Machine-ID" to a user's computer to identify and
track the computer. Toluna SAS will not use digital fingerprinting
technology (the "Technology") to collect Personal Information, or
track the online activities, of the user of a computer; and will
not disrupt or interfere with the use or control of a computer or
alter, modify or change the settings or functionality of a
computer. Toluna SAS will use the Technology to assist Toluna SAS's
clients in ensuring the integrity of survey results. The Technology
will analyse publicly available information and data obtained from
the computer's web browser and from other publicly available data
points, including without limitation the technical settings of the
computer, the characteristics of the computer, and the computer's
IP Address, to create a unique identifier assigned to the computer.
The unique identifier will be an alpha-numeric id. After creating
the unique identifier, Toluna SAS does not retain the information
0d by the Technology to create the unique identifier. In
furtherance of Toluna SAS's efforts to assist its clients in
protecting and ensuring the integrity of survey results, Toluna SAS
(a) may link or associate your unique identifier to you and any of
your Personal Information; (b) may share your unique identifier
with Toluna SAS's clients and with other sample or panel providers;
and (c) may receive or obtain a unique identifier linked to you
from a third party, including without limitation a sample or panel
provider or a client of Toluna SAS. Any unique identifier(s)
received or obtained by Toluna SAS and linked to a specific
individual will be protected in accordance with this Privacy
Policy.<br>
<br>

 <span class="new_trust_privacy">Opt-Out Policy</span><br>

 By becoming a Toluna SAS panel member, you agree to receive emails
inviting you to participate in surveys that we feel may match your

 <span class="new_trust_privacy">Winners Policy and Privacy
Guarantee</span><br>
<br>
 Panel members and others who take our surveys are randomly
selected to win prizes for participation in surveys, polls, and
other promotions. All winners are notified by email of their
winnings. Once we deposit winnings in accounts, panelists have the
option to request that a check be mailed to them at any time. For
more information, please visit our <strong>Terms and
Conditions</strong> page. Cash and other prizes awarded to
non-panel members will be awarded directly. Occasionally we ask a
prize winner to grant us permission to post his/her name on the
Winners page on the Toluna SAS website. We will never post a name
on our Winners page without an individual's prior permission.<br>
<br>
 Notification of Changes<br>
<br>
 If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those
changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places
we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we
collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we
disclose it.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any
time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes
to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a
notice on our home page.<br>
<br>
 <span class="new_trust_privacy">Security</span><br>
<br>
 Toluna SAS takes strict measures to ensure every aspect of your
information is kept secure. Access to all personal information is
restricted and limited to few key personnel. Our website security
is reviewed periodically and can only be accessed via a strict
password policy. Toluna SAS will never ask you for private
information such as your credit card or social security numbers as
a part of our research. We may be required by law to ask for your
social security number or other government-issued identifier to
comply with reporting laws and regulations if you are the recipient
of survey incentives. We use SSL encryption when collecting or
transmitting sensitive information. Your profile information is
highly confidential and will be used only by Toluna SAS to email
you concerning our studies, newsletters, winner notifications, and
incentive redemptions, or as otherwise provided for in this privacy
policy.<br>
 <span class="new_trust_privacy"><br>
 Business Transfers</span><br>
<br>
 As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy
additional assets. In such transactions, Toluna SAS's right to
contact its panel members and the information you have voluntarily
provided in your user profile would generally be one of the
transferred business assets. Any sale or transfer of Toluna SAS or
substantially all of its business assets, which included our panel,
would be to an entity that agreed to comply with all of the
material terms of our privacy policy.<br>
<br>
 <span class="new_trust_privacy">Links</span><br>
<br>
 From time to time we may offer visitors the ability to voluntarily
link to other sites. Toluna SAS does not review, and is not
responsible for, the content or effect of the privacy policies of
these sites.<br>
 <span class="new_trust_privacy"><br>
 Legal Disclaimer</span><br>

 We may disclose personal information when required by law or in
the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to
the edicts of the law or to comply with a legal process served on
our website.<br>
