This document is our privacy policy and it tells you how we collect and manage your personal information.</p>

            <h2>2 What is your personal information?</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>When used in this privacy policy, the term “personal information” has the meaning given to it in the Act. In general terms, it is any information that can be used to personally identify you. This may include your name, address, telephone number, email address and profession or occupation. If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.</p>
            <h2>3 What personal information do we collect and hold?</h2>
            <p>We may collect the following types of personal information:</p>
            <ul type="circle">

                <li>mailing or street address;</li>
                <li>email address;</li>

                <li>any additional information relating to you that you provide to us directly through our websites or indirectly through use of our websites or online presence, through our representatives or otherwise;</li>
                <li>information you provide to us through our service centre, customer surveys and records of communications between you and us relating to products and/or services provided by us to you;</li>

            </ul>

                <li>through your access and use of our website;</li>
                <li>during conversations between you and our representatives; or</li>
                <li>when you complete a transaction</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In some cases we may also collect your personal information through the use of cookies. When you access our website, we may send a “cookie” (which is a small summary file containing a unique ID number) to your computer. This enables us to recognise your computer and greet you each time you visit our website without bothering you with a request to register/login. It also enables us to keep track of products or services you view so that, if you consent, we can send you news about those products or services. We also use cookies to measure traffic patterns, to determine which areas of our website have been visited and to measure transaction patterns in the aggregate. We use this to research our users’ habits so that we can improve our online products and services. Our cookies do not collect personal information. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you can set your browser so that your computer does not accept them. Please note if your browser is set to not accept cookies, you will not be able to use our site or service.</p>
            <p>We may log IP addresses (that is, the electronic addresses of computers connected to the internet) to analyse trends, administer the website, track users movements, and gather broad demographic information.</p>

                <li>we may be unable to tailor the content of our websites to your preferences and your experience of our websites may not be as enjoyable or useful.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>

            <ul type="circle">
                <li>our employees, related bodies corporate, contractors or service providers for the purposes of operation of our website or our business, fulfilling requests by you, and to otherwise provide products and services to you including, without limitation, web hosting providers, IT systems administrators, mailing houses, couriers, payment processors, data entry service providers, electronic network administrators, debt collectors, and professional advisors such as accountants, solicitors, business advisors and consultants;</li>
                <li>suppliers and other third parties with whom we have commercial relationships, for business, marketing, and related purposes; and</li>

            <h2>9 Direct marketing materials</h2>
            <p>We may send you direct marketing communications and information about our products and services that we consider may be of interest to you. These communications may be sent in various forms, including mail, SMS, fax and email, in accordance with applicable marketing laws, such as the <em>Spam Act 2003</em> (Cth). If you indicate a preference for a method of communication, we will endeavour to use that method whenever practical to do so. In addition, at any time you may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by contacting us (see the details below) or by using opt-out facilities provided in the marketing communications and we will then ensure that your name is removed from our mailing list.</p>
            <p>We do not provide your personal information to other organisations for the purposes of direct marketing.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>10 How can you access and correct your personal information?</h2>
            <p>You may request access to any personal information we hold about you at any time by contacting us (see the details below). Where we hold information that you are entitled to access, we will try to provide you with suitable means of accessing it (for example, by mailing or emailing it to you). We will not charge for simply making the request and will not charge for making any corrections to your personal information.</p>
            <p>There may be instances where we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold. For example, we may need to refuse access if granting access would interfere with the privacy of others or if it would result in a breach of confidentiality. If that happens, we will give you written reasons for any refusal.</p>
            <p>If you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then you may request us to amend it. We will consider if the information requires amendment. If we do not agree that there are grounds for amendment then we will add a note to the personal information stating that you disagree with it.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>11 What is the process for complaining about a breach of privacy?</h2>
