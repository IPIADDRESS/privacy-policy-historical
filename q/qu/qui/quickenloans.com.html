                           with your computer's capabilities, and (2) determine whether you've opened an HTML e-mail. When you click on a link within
                           an e-mail message, you will first pass through our server, then are redirected onto the Internet.  We use this data on an
                           aggregate level to evaluate response rates to our e-mail messages and to determine which links are most useful to our customer

                           or outsourcers, to complete a business process or provide a service on our behalf.  For example, we may use service providers
                           to deliver products,  or to send e-mails. When we employ service providers, we may need to share your personally identifiable
                           information. Service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for purposes other
                           than to act on our behalf.

                     <ul>
                        <li><b>Cookies.</b> A "cookie" is a small piece of information that our Web site may provide to your browser while you are at our sites.  The
                           Quicken Loans Web site supplies your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to better understand Web site usage in
                           the aggregate and on an individual level so we know what areas of our site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits
                           to those areas). This is done through a tracking utility that allows us, for example, to reconstruct activity from a session
                           or by a user, for troubleshooting and issue resolution purposes.  <br><br>When periodic surveys are presented to web site visitors, cookies are used to prevent issuing multiple invitations to the
                           same individual.<br><br>If you are a registered member on the Quicken Loans Web site, you will receive a cookie when you login. This cookie is maintained by your browser and contains your identifier.
                           This cookie is also used to authenticate your identity and provide you with access to areas of our Web site that are limited
                           to registered members, such as those that allow you to view and manage your personal profile.<br><br>Additionally, Quicken Loans service providers that serve ads on affiliate and/or advertiser Web sites may assign different
                           cookies and small graphical images called single-pixel GIFs or web beacons, to your browser to track the effectiveness of
                           Quicken Loans advertising on other Web sites and your involvement with Quicken Loans.  For example, as part of the Quicken Loans affiliate programs, our service providers use cookies and web beacons to determine when affiliate program members have referred
                           a customer to Quicken Loans via a link on their Web site.  The Quicken Loans Web site also sets a temporary cookie that contains a unique, anonymous identifier that is provided to the service provider
                           to ensure that each referral is only counted once.  This cookie is not linked to a customer's personal information.  The cookies
                           and web beacons are necessary to ensure that affiliate program members are appropriately credited for their referrals.  Service
                           providers report data in the aggregate and do not link it to individual customer information.<br><br>If you simply want to browse, you do not have to accept cookies from our site.   Should you decide, however, that you would
                           like to register and sign in to special areas of the Web site and you have modified your browser settings not to accept cookies,
                           you will need to re-set your browser to accept the cookies that we send.  Otherwise, you won't be able to participate in certain
                           areas of the Web site.  Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies.<br><br>Advertising networks that serve ads on this Web site may assign different cookies to you.  Those cookies may be used to track
                           your involvement with the advertising on our site.<br><br>  You may choose not to accept cookies from third party ad servers. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn
