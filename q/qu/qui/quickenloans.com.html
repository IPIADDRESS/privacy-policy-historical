	a white bg color with the label color #333399. There is always a "spacer" row

At Intuit, we dedicate ourselves to revolutionizing the way individuals and small businesses manage their financial lives.  In that effort, we respect and protect the privacy of those who visit or use our Web sites. We want you to know how your information is used.

<br><br>
This privacy statement defines privacy aspects specific to the QuickenLoans.com  (QuickenLoans.Quicken.com) Web site and affiliated Intuit Web servers (referred to as the "Quicken Loans Web site").  It serves as an adjunct to the <a href="/jump/external.asp?dest=http://privacy.intuit.com/policies/">Intuit Online Privacy Policy</a>, which represents our general privacy philosophy and governs all of our Web sites.  The Quicken Loans Web site's privacy practices are consistent and compliant with that policy.
<br><br>
Because of the financial nature of our business, our Web sites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. Therefore, we don't knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children.
<br><br><br>
<b>Our Philosophy and Practices</b><br><br>
We want to give you the comfort and confidence you need to fully participate in our online offerings so that we can better serve your needs.  Therefore, here are the principles governing our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web site:

<b>WE PROVIDE YOU NOTICE OF OUR WEB SITE INFORMATION PRACTICES</b>.<br><br>
To maximize the value of our services, we may request information from you when you visit our Web sites. In this Privacy Statement, we tell you what is being collected, how it is collected, by whom it is being collected, why it is being collected and to whom it may be disclosed.
<br><br>
Here is how and why we collect and use information from you:
</a><ul><a name="notice">
	<li><b>Tools, Applications and Registration.</b> We provide a number of ways for you to explore your options for mortgages and loans, so you can determine which options may be the most desirable for you. You can engage a number of tools, planners, calculators and other interactive advisors, such as the online interviews without providing us your identity. We will not ask you for personally identifiable information to use these features, and do not attribute the information that you provide to you as an individual. 
		<br><br>However, if you want to exercise one or more of the loan options presented, we will ask you to register at the site and supply other identifying and supporting information needed to process your request. By registering, you can save information such as loan interviews and applications for later review and update. When you register, you select a member ID name by which we will know you, choose a password and provide us an e-mail address.  You use the member ID name and password to gain access to your loan application information, financial profile and/or customized rates.  We use your contact information to provide you with alerts and updates regarding your loan status, which is part of the Quicken Loans service. If you choose, we will also use it to send you communications and promotional materials for Quicken Loans and other Intuit products. We may supply the information you provide, on a confidential basis, to third parties, such as credit reporting services, who assist us in qualifying, processing, closing and servicing your loan.<br><br>
	</li></a><li><a name="notice"><b>Consumer Report.</b> Quicken Loans, Inc., which originates loans through the Quicken Loans Web site, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Intuit, Inc. By submitting a loan application or a request to be pre-qualified to us, you authorize us to share your consumer report with our parent, affiliates and subsidiaries only to process your loan application. You may direct us not to share such information with our parent, affiliates and subsidiaries by e-mailing us at </a><a href="mailto:support@QuickenLoans.com">support@QuickenLoans.com</a>.<br><br>
	</li><li><b>Newsletters.</b>  We provide you the opportunity to subscribe to e-mail newsletters and other e-mail communications. When sending you e-mail we may automatically collect technical information that allows us to format messages to best align with your computer's capabilities.  This data is used solely to enhance the presentation of the content you receive. You may unsubscribe by following the instructions provided in each e-mail newsletter.<br><br>
	</li><li><b>Interactive Help (Chat).</b> You may initiate an online interactive discussion with a Quicken Loans support professional to facilitate the completion of your loan application. We do not ask for any personally identifiable information to utilize this service, however, the contents of the dialogue are completely at your discretion.<br><br>
	</li><li><b>Message Boards.</b> We may provide you the opportunity to engage other members and our select special guests in dialog about finances and related topics through our message boards.  These dialogs occur in a public forum, so any information that you provide is considered public, non-confidential and non-proprietary. We offer you the ability to create nicknames which you may use on the message boards.  Unless you disclose it, only you and Intuit will know the linkage between your nicknames and your member name. <br><br>
	</li><li><b>Contests and Surveys.</b> From time to time, we may offer you the option to participate in contests or surveys.  If you would like to participate, we may ask you for contact information, preferences or other information. This information may be used to conduct research, improve our offerings or award prizes.  Our contests may have separate rules and we will identify how the information that you supply will be used in each case.<br><br>
	</li><li><b>Mandatory and Optional Information.</b> We also identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request.  Whenever we ask for additional or optional information, we identify those fields appropriately so that you know what is required to provide the requested service.
</li></ul>

<br>
<b>HOW WE USE WEB TECHNOLOGY:</b><br>
Here is how and why we use some common Web technologies to help manage our Web sites:
<ul>
	<li><b>Cookies.</b> A "cookie" is a small piece of information that our Web site may provide to your browser while you are at our sites.  The Quicken Loans Web site supplies your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so we know what areas of our site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas).
		<br><br>If you are a registered member on the Quicken Loans Web site, you will receive a cookie when you login. This cookie is maintained by your browser and contains your identifier. This cookie is also used to authenticate your identity and provide you with access to areas of our Web site that are limited to registered members, such as those that allow you to view and manage your personal profile.
		<br><br>If you simply want to browse, you do not have to accept cookies from our site.   Should you decide, however, that you would like to register and sign in to special areas of the Web site and you have modified your browser settings not to accept cookies, you will need to re-set your browser to accept the cookies that we send.  Otherwise, you won't be able to participate in certain areas of the Web site.  Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies. 
		<br><br>Advertising networks that serve ads on this Web site may assign different cookies to you.  Those cookies may be used to track your involvement with the advertising on our site.  You may choose not to accept these cookies. You should review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use private information.  If you have questions about our ad serving networks, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@intuit.com">privacy@intuit.com</a>.<br><br>
		
	</li><li><b>Web Site Usage Data.</b> With or without cookies, our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL.  We use this data to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer.  This information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting.<br><br>
	</li><li><b>Co-branded and Third-Party Sites.</b> Our co-branded sites are clearly identified by both an Intuit and a partner's logo. The Quicken Loans site may provide links to third-party Web sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. On these sites either Intuit or its partners may collect information about you. Intuit is not responsible for the actions of these third parties.  We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personally identifiable information.
</li></ul>
<br>
If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we'll post those changes to this privacy statement 30 days before they take effect. 
<br><br>
In some cases we may be required to disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant.
<br><br><br>
<a name="choices">
<b>WE GIVE YOU CHOICES ABOUT HOW THE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE US MAY BE USED.</b>
