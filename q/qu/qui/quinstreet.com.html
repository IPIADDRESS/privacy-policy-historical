<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="cnk">We at QuinStreet, Inc. and our affiliated companies worldwide ("QuinStreet") are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us.</p>
<p class="cnk">QuinStreet has established this Online PRIVACY POLICY so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information.</p>
<p class="cnk">Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information. In general, you can visit QuinStreet's Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.</p>
<p class="cnk">If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the Web, we may transfer that Information within QuinStreet or to QuinStreet's third-party service providers, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.</p>
<p class="cnk">QuinStreet strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, QuinStreet intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Online PRIVACY POLICY even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.</p>
<h2>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p class="cnk">Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about website activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Web user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.</p>
<p class="cnk">You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the website.</p>
<p>If you prefer that your browser does not store this cookie information, there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny or accept this feature. In order to "opt out" of the benefits of cookies, you can manually delete your cookies by following the instructions contained in the "Help" section of your browser. Alternatively, simply click the "OPT OUT NOW" link provided, below. QuinStreet uses a limited number of third party providers to manage cookies, and when you click the link below, you will be opted out of their tracking systems. Note that separate browser windows will be opened, and you need to allow pop-ups for this to happen.</p>
<p><a href="http://assets.invitemedia.com/opt-out.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Opt Out Now</a></p>

<h2>Notice<a name="notice"></a></h2>
<p class="cnk">Where QuinStreet collects Personal Information on the web, we intend to post a purpose statement that explains why Personal Information will be collected and whether we plan to share such Personal Information outside of QuinStreet or those working on QuinStreet's behalf. QuinStreet does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on QuinStreet's behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Sometimes the purpose statement for our web pages are set forth in privacy policies specifically set forth or linked to from that page.</p>
<h2>Choice<a name="choice"></a></h2>
<p class="cnk">You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to QuinStreet.
