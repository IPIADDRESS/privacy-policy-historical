            </p>
            <h3>
                1. Personal Data:</h3>
            <p>
                Organizers: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such
                information on the Site, such as when you register for access to the Quicket Services
                as an Organizer, contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys or use
                certain Quicket Services. The Personal Data we collect includes without limitation
                your name, email address and other personally identifiable information. In addition,
                if you use our payment processing services, we will collect financial information
                from you (e.g., your bank account information) as necessary to facilitate payments.
                <br>
                <br>
                Buyers and other non-Organizers: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily
                provide such information on the Site (including event registration pages within
                <br>
                <br>
                the Site), such as when you register for access to the Quicket Services (whether
                as an Organizer or otherwise), register for an event as a Buyer, contact us with
                inquiries, respond to one of our surveys or use certain Quicket Services. The Personal
                Data we collect includes without limitation your name, email address and other personally
                identifiable information. If you register for a paid event, we will collect financial
                information from you (e.g., your credit card number and expiration date, billing
                address, etc) some of which may constitute Personal Data.
                <br>
                <br>
                Privacy Policy Links: We make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy
                in the footer of every page on the Site, including those pages on which Personal
                Data is collected.
            </p>
            <h3>
                2. Non-Personal Data:</h3>
            <p>
                Non-Identifiable Data: When you interact with the Site, we collect certain personally
                non- identifiable information ("Non-Personal Data"). The Non-Personal Data we collect
                includes without limitation Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, domain names of your
                Internet Service Provider, your approximate geographic location, a record of the
                Site pages that you visit, the time of your visits and aggregated Personal Data
                that cannot be used to specifically identify you. Such information, which is collected
                passively using various technologies is strictly for statistical purposes and cannot,
                in and of itself, be used to specifically identify you.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cookies: In operating the Site, we use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is
                a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser
                when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the
                Site and help us analyse Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may
                set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing
                to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site.
                These cookies may be used to tailor content you see on the Site as well as other
                sites that you may visit in the future. Through your web browser's option settings
                you may be able (i) to receive notifications when you are receiving new cookies,
                (ii) to disable cookies or (iii) to delete cookies. Please refer to your web browser's
                help section for information on how to do this. We recommend that you leave cookies
                turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's features.
                <br><br>
                Google Analytics: This cookie allows us to see information on user website activities including, but not limited to page views, source and time spent on website. The information is depersonalised and is displayed as numbers, meaning it cannot be tracked back to individuals. This will help to protect your privacy. Using Google Analytics we can see what content is popular on our website, and strive to give you more of the things you enjoy reading.
                <br><br>
                DoubleClick: We use remarketing codes to log when users view specific pages, allowing us to provide targeted advertising in the future when you visit other websites which display Google Ads.
                <br>
                <br>
                Aggregated Personal Data: In an on-going effort to better understand and serve the
                users of the Site and Quicket Services, Quicket often conducts research on its customer
                demographics, interests and behaviour based on Personal Data and other information
                that we have collected. This research may be compiled and analysed on an aggregate
                basis and this aggregate information is strictly for statistical purposes and does
                not identify you personally and therefore is considered and treated as Non-Personal
                Data under this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Our Use of Information That We Collect:</h2>
            <h3>
                1. Personal Data:</h3>
            <p>
                Quicket uses the Personal Data we collect in a manner that is consistent with this
                Privacy Policy. Quicket may use the Personal Data as follows:
                </p><ul>
                    <li>Specific Reason: If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the
                        Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance,
                        if you contact us by e-mail, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer
                        your question or resolve your problem and will respond to the email address from
                        which the contact came. </li>
                    <li>Access and Use: If you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to or use
                        of the Site or Quicket Services or any functionality thereof, we will use your Personal
                        Data to provide you with access to or use of such services or functionality and
                        to monitor your use of such services or functionality. For instance, if you supply
                        payment information (e.g., bank account or credit card information) to the Site
                        for the purpose of purchasing tickets as a Buyer or processing payments as an Organizer,
                        Quicket will use that information to facilitate such purchase or process such payments.</li>

                Our Disclosure of Information That We Collect:</h2>
            <h3>
                1. Personal Data:</h3>
            <p>
                Quicket is not in the business of selling your Personal Data. We consider this information
                to be a vital part of our relationship with you. Therefore, Quicket will not sell
                your Personal Data to third parties, including third party advertisers. There are,
                however, certain circumstances in which we may disclose, transfer or share your
                Personal Data with certain third parties without your consent, as set forth below:
                <br>
                <br>
                Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses
                or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution

                affiliates for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. Our subsidiaries and
                affiliates will be bound to maintain that Personal Data in accordance with this
                Privacy Policy.
                <br>
                <br>
                Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Quicket, like many businesses, sometimes
                engages other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples
                of such functions include mailing information, ticket fulfilment, maintaining databases
                and processing payments. When we engage another company to perform such functions,
                we may provide them with information, including Personal Data, in connection with
                their performance of such functions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Organizers: When you purchase tickets to, register for or donate to an event on
                our Site, you consent to our providing your Personal Data to the Organizers of such
                event. These Organizers are not bound to treat your Personal Data in accordance
                with this Privacy Policy. You agree that Quicket is not responsible for the actions
                of these Organizers with respect to your Personal Data. It is important that you
                review the applicable policies of the Organizers of an event before providing Personal
                Data or other information in connection with that event.
                <br>
                <br>
                Legal Requirements: Quicket may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so
                by law (including, without limitation responding to a subpoena or request from law
                enforcement, court or government agency) or in the good faith belief that such action
                is necessary (i) to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) to protect and defend the
                rights or property of Quicket, (iii) to act in urgent circumstances to protect the
                personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) to protect against legal

                Your Choices:</h2>
            <p>
                You have several choices available when it comes to your Personal Data:
                <br>
                <br>
                Limit the Personal Data You Provide: You can use the Site without providing any
                Personal Data or with limiting the Personal Data you provide. If you choose not
                to provide any Personal Data or limit the Personal Data you provide, you may not
                be able to use certain Site functionality and/or Quicket Services. For instance,
                in order to open a Quicket account or to buy or sell tickets, your name and email
                address will be required.
                <br>
                <br>
                Opt Out: You can "opt out" of receiving Quicket newsletter emails by clicking on
                the "unsubscribe" link in newsletter emails. It may take up to 24 hours for us to
                process
                <br>
                <br>
                an unsubscribe request. Note that you cannot unsubscribe from Quicket Service communications
                via the Site. You can stop receiving Quicket Service communications only by contacting
                us at http://www.Quicket.co.za/contactus.aspx and closing your account. Even after
                you opt out of all communications, Quicket will retain your Personal Data and Non-
                Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, however, we will no longer
                use it to contact you. Organizers who have received your Personal Data in accordance
                with this Privacy Policy may continue to use that Personal Data to contact you in
                accordance with their own privacy policies, but they may not use Quicket's system
                to do so.

                usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never
                to provide Personal Data on the Site without their permission. If you have reason
                to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal Data to Quicket
                through the Site, please contact us and we will endeavour to delete that information
                from our databases.
