    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>CashEuroNetUK, LLC Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of CashEuroNetUK, LLC and its affiliated companies (“CashEuroNetUK”) with respect to individually identifiable information and sensitive personal information (“Personal Data”) that is collected on the CashEuroNetUK website at <a href="http://www.quickquid.co.uk">www.quickquid.co.uk</a> (“Website”).   “You” or “Your” means you as a participant in, or as a user of, the Website.  “We” or “our” or “us” means CashEuroNetUK and its affiliates.  By visiting and using our Website, you are accepting, and consenting to, the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>EU Safe Harbor</h2>
<p>The website servers that support the Website, as well as many of our operations, are located in the United States.  In order to properly protect Personal Data that we receive in the United States about EU residents, we adhere to the US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles with respect to the use and processing of such data in the United States (“EU Safe Harbor”).  For further background about the EU Safe Harbor, please refer to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s website at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>, or contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>By providing us with your personal information on our Website or in the course of using our services, you consent to the transfer of your personal data, and any other data we acquire about you from third-party service providers in the process of evaluating you for a loan, to companies outside the EU, including CashEuroNetUK, its affiliates, and authorised third parties, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting Personal Data is to provide you with an accurate, customised loan transaction. The information we obtain from our customers helps us personalise and continually improve our customers’ experience at our Website. We automatically collect and/or track the following types of information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web page http headers (home server domain names, IP address, type of client computer, and type of Web browser).</li>
  <li>Information provided by you through on-line forms, registration forms, surveys, and/or other entries, such as sensitive personal information, email addresses, personal, financial or demographic information.</li>
  <li>Information, user specific or aggregate, on what pages our visitors access. </li>
  <li>Automatic information and cookies: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website. For example, like many Websites, we use “cookies” to obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our Website and when you login, such as: your name and your email address.  Cookies are pieces of information that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive via your Web browser. They allow us to provide you with a more convenient and personalised shopping experience by recording information about your preferences.<br><br>
  A web browser is usually set to accept cookies automatically but can be changed to decline them. The Help section of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable cookies altogether.  In most cases, a visitor may refuse a cookie and still fully navigate our Website.<br><br>
  Please note that the information in our cookies can be requested only by our Website. Your browser will not pass these cookies to any other site.</li>
  <li>Information about your transactions with us or others, such as payment history and loan balances, and information you provide when you contact our customer service department.</li>
  <li>Information we receive from third parties, such as credit bureaus, consumer reporting agencies and other lenders, regarding creditworthiness and credit history. </li>
  <li>Information, user specific or aggregate, on what pages our visitor’s access.</li>
  <li>The email addresses of visitors that communicate with CashEuroNetUK via email.  You can choose to receive marketing email communications from us by signing up online. When you sign up for CashEuroNetUK's email, we may, from time to time, send you communications from CashEuroNetUK or we may send you information about our affiliated companies, including the parent company in our group, Cash America International, Inc. The emails we send may include special offers, advance notice of new releases and in-store promotions, updates on services offered and notification of upcoming events. </li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure that we are providing materials of interest to you, we may monitor whether you opened a particular email have clicked on the images and/or links therein.  Our email communications may include HTML-based email messages, which includes an invisible coded sensor that is activated when the email message is opened. This sensor communicates the date and time the message was opened and, more importantly, whether your computer is capable of receiving HTML-based email. You will receive a functioning sensor only if your computer is enabled to accept HTML email.</p>
<h2>How We Use and Disclose Personal Data</h2>
<p>We use your Personal Data to process your loan transaction, enhance your experience at our Website, and (as described in the next section below) to transmit marketing communications. We may also use your Personal Data for such purposes as processing payments, updating our account records, improving our Website, conducting statistical analysis and for editorial or feedback purposes for our advertisers.</p>
<p>When you provide your Personal Data, you are consenting to sharing it with CashEuroNetUK, our affiliated entities, and third parties as further described herein:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Service Providers: We contract with service providers to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include database providers who assist in identity verification, credit scoring companies, magazine publishers, retailers, and direct marketers.  Their access is limited only to the Personal Data needed to perform their functions, and only for the purpose of performing those functions, and they are prohibited from using or disclosing the Personal Data for other purposes. </li>
  <li>Related Company/Group Transfers:  CashEuroNetUK is part of a larger group of related companies and may need to disclose customer Personal Data to its affiliates from time to time for administrative and compliance purposes, including the group parent company, Cash America International, Inc.</li>
  <li>Other Disclosures: In accordance with our customary practices and those in our industry, we disclose information about your transactions with us to credit bureaus.  If necessary or appropriate in connection with the sale or transfer of the loans or all or part of the business, we disclose relevant Personal Data to third party purchasers.  We also release personal and account Personal Data if it becomes necessary for compliance with law or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our Website, our users, or third parties. We reserve the right to release such Personal Data to law enforcement or other governmental officials as we, in our sole and absolute discretion, deem necessary to comply with the law.  </li>
  <li>With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when Personal Data about you may be shared with third parties not described above, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the Personal Data. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the sharing of your Personal Data as described above, please contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Policy.  Depending on the nature of your request, you may have the opportunity to opt-out of these sharing practices in limited circumstances.  In addition, we reserve the right to use and disclose all information that is not in individually identifiable form as we deem appropriate in our sole discretion.</p>
<h2>Marketing and Opt-Out Rights</h2>
<p>By visiting our Website, you understand and agree that we may contact you at the phone number or email address you enter on your loan application to assist you with your loan or to discuss other products and services that CashEuroNetUK may provide for you.  You may opt-out of receiving these marketing communications from us by not submitting your Personal Data.  We also allow you to opt-out of our use of your Personal Data for marketing purposes at any time by responding to any of our e-mail communications with “remove” in the subject line, or by sending us an email to support@quickquid.co.uk or by visiting your customer account at www.quickquid.co.uk and updating your contact preferences.  If you opt-out of our use of your Personal Data for marketing purposes, we will honour such choice once we have had a reasonable opportunity to process your request.  We reserve the right to take reasonable steps to authenticate your identity with respect to any such request or other inquiry. </p>
<h2>How We Protect the Security of Your Personal Data</h2>
<p>We maintain reasonable measures to protect security and confidentiality of your Personal Data, and strive to keep it accurate, and only for as long as is necessary.  Some of the specific security measures we maintain include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We work to protect the security of your Personal Data during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts Personal Data you input. </li>
  <li>We store Personal Data in a restricted access format.</li>
  <li>We transmit Personal Data in an encrypted format</li>
  <li>Our networks are secured with certified firewalls in a multi-layered fashion with redundancy.</li>
  <li>Our network related equipments (e.g., firewalls, routers, switches, etc) are secured with a password, and access is limited to authorized network engineers.</li>
  <li>We restrict the access of customer service support staff so that extremely sensitive Personal Data cannot be viewed (e.g. full bank account Personal Data is not revealed, but only a partial number of digits to allow verification).</li>
  <li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your User ID and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. </li>
</ul>
<h2>You May Access your Personal Data </h2>
<p>CashEuroNetUK believes that you should have the ability to review and update your account Personal Data. CashEuroNetUK gives you access to Personal Data about your account and your interactions with CashEuroNetUK for the purpose of viewing and updating that Personal Data.</p>
