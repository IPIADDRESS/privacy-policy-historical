<dd id="pp_collect" class="faq faq_answer">

<p>Our primary goal in collecting Personal Data is to provide you with an accurate, customised loan transaction. The information we obtain from our customers helps us personalise and continually improve our customers’ experience at our Website. We automatically collect and/or track the following types of information:</p>
<ul>

For example, like many Websites, we use “cookies” to obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our Website and when you login, such as: your name and your email address.  Cookies are pieces of information that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive via your Web browser. They allow us to provide you with a more convenient and personalised shopping experience by recording information about your preferences.<br><br>
  A web browser is usually set to accept cookies automatically but can be changed to decline them.

In most cases, a visitor may refuse a cookie and still fully navigate our Website.<br><br>
  Please note that the information in our cookies can be requested only by our Website. Your browser will not pass these cookies to any other site.</li>
  <li>Information about your transactions with us or others, such as payment history and loan balances, and information you provide when you contact our customer service department.</li>
