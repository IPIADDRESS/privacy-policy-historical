  <p>Terms and Conditions apply. <span class="disclaimer_apr">Typical 2356% APR.</span> Loan amounts are based on consumer's credit history and ability to repay loan. Not everyone may qualify for £750. QuickQuid performs traditional credit checks, while still accepting those with less-than-perfect credit.  QuickQuid verifies applicant information via various national databases.  Funds will be deposited the same working day, if approved by 14:30. Approval may take up to 30 minutes in most cases. Payday advances should be used for short-term financial needs only, not as a long-term financial solution. Customers with credit difficulties should seek credit counselling.</p>
