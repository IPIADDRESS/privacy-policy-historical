Quia Corporation is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please
read the following policy to understand how your personal information will
be treated as you make full use of all of Quia Corporation's offerings.
This policy may change from time to time so please check back
periodically. The following explains the information we gather
and how we gather it, and our policies with respect to its use.<br><br>


<font face="arial,helvetica"><b>Our Commitment To Privacy</b></font><br>
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect  your privacy we
provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the
choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage.<br><br>

This policy will let you know the following:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="#PB">What personally identifiable information is collected from
you</a></li>
<li><a href="#PC">What cookies are and how they are used</a></li>

<hr><br><a name="PB"></a>
<font face="arial,helvetica" size="+2">What personally identifiable  
information does Quia Corporation collect from me?</font><br>
Quia Corporation collects information in several ways from different parts
of our Web site.<br><br>
Some personal information  is gathered when you register. Quia Corporation asks for your name, e-mail address,
username, and password during registration. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to
Quia Corporation and are able to take full
advantage of Quia's free service.<br><br>
In addition to during registration, we may ask you for personal information at other
times, such as when you report a problem with one
of our sites or services. Quia Corporation also encourages users to
complete surveys that we use for site enhancement and research purposes. 
If you contact Quia Corporation, such as through the use of surveys, we may keep a
record of that correspondence. 
Wherever Quia Corporation collects personal information, we make an effort
to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.<br><br> 
 
<a href="#PA">Top</a><hr><br><a name="PC"></a>

<font face="arial,helvetica" size="+2">What are cookies and how does Quia
Corporation use them?</font><br>
As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services,
Quia Corporation uses  <a href="cookies.html"> 
cookies</a> to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie
is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server
and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sites on Quia Corporation
where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require that you
accept cookies.<br><br>
Generally, we use cookies to: <br><br>
(1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account information
(stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more
personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "Log In" and
is modified when you "Log Out" of our services. If you choose to reject all 
cookies you will be unable to use those Quia Corporation services, such as 
the activity and quiz creation tools, that require 
registration in order to participate.<br><br>
(2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing Quia Corporation is
given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat
usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to
help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior.<br><br> 
(3)  Identify registered users who take our 
<a href="http://www.quia.com/survey.html">online survey</a>.<br><br>
(4) Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of Quia Corporation's
Web sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate.
We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or
different from one another so that we can make each new experience on Quia
Corporation a better one. We may use this information to better
personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users
will see on our sites.<br><br> 
Advertising networks that serve ads onto Quia Corporation may also use
their own cookies.<br><br> 
Quia Corporation also collects <a href="http://www.zdwebopedia.com/TERM/I/IP_address.html">
IP addresses</a> for system administration and to report aggregate
information to our advertisers.<br><br> 
 
<a href="#PA">Top</a><hr><br><a name="PD"></a>

<font face="arial,helvetica" size="+2">How does Quia Corporation use my 
information?</font><br>
Quia Corporation's primary goal in collecting personal information is to
provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our sites. This
includes personalization services, interactive communications, and many
other types of services, all of which are completely free to you. In order
to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing
a little about you, Quia Corporation is able to deliver more relevant
advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.  In our role
of delivering targeted advertisements, Quia Corporation plays the
middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of
audience they want to reach (for example, instructors of a particular
subject). Quia Corporation takes the advertisement and displays it to
users meeting those criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has
access to individual account information. Only Quia Corporation has access
to individuals' accounts. This kind of advertisement targeting is done
with banner ads through Quia Corporation Web locations. Also with this
type of targeting, the advertisements are more likely to be of particular
interest to Quia users. <br><br>
Quia Corporation does research on our users' demographics, interests,
and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration,
from our server log files, or from surveys. We do this to better
understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on
an aggregated basis. Quia Corporation may share this aggregated data with
advertisers or business partners.<br><br> 
 
<a href="#PA">Top</a><hr><br><a name="PE"></a>

<font face="arail,helvetica" size="+2">Who is collecting information?</font><br> 
When you are on a Quia Corporation site and are asked for personal
information, you are sharing that information with Quia Corporation alone,
unless it is specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected
and/or maintained by any company other than Quia Corporation, you will be
notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do
not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer
by not using that particular service.<br><br>
Please be aware that Quia Corporation Internet access partners,
advertisers, and Web sites that have links on our site may collect
personally identifiable information about you. The information practices
of those Internet access partners, advertisers, and Web sites linked to
Quia Corporation are not covered by this privacy
statement.<br><br> 
 
<a href="#PA">Top</a><hr><br><a name="PF"></a>

<font face="arial,helvetica" size="+2">With whom does Quia Corporation share
my information?</font><br>
As a general rule, Quia Corporation will not disclose any of your
personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or
under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that
the law requires it or under the circumstances described below.  The
following describes some of the ways that your information may be
disclosed.<br><br>
<u>Business Partners &amp; Sponsors</u>.  Quia Corporation will never disclose
your personal information to business partners or sponsors, unless it is
specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to
transferring the data. If personally identifying data about you will be
shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data.<br><br>
<u>Third Party Data &amp; Data in the Aggregate</u>.  Under confidentiality
agreements, Quia Corporation may match user information with third party
data. Also, Quia Corporation discloses aggregated user statistics (for
example, 45% of our users are female) in order to describe our services to
current and prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties,
and for other lawful purposes.<br><br>
<u>Other</u>.  Quia Corporation may also disclose account information in
special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this
information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action
against someone who may be violating Quia Corporation's Terms of Service
or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or
unintentionally) Quia Corporation's rights or property, other Quia
Corporation users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.
Quia Corporation may disclose or access account information when we
believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and
other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve
our products and services.<br><br>
 
<a href="#PA">Top</a><hr><br><a name="PG"></a>

<font face="arial,helvetica" size="+2">What are my choices regarding
collection, use, and distribution of my information?</font><br>
Quia Corporation may, from time to time, send you e-mail regarding our
products and services. In addition, we may occasionally send you direct mail
about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only
Quia Corporation (or agents working on behalf of Quia Corporation and
under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. 
Quia will only send direct marketing mailings that allow you to unsubscribe (opt out) from the mailing list.<br><br>
You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser
preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified
when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject
all cookies you will be unable to use those Quia Corporation services, 
such as the activity and quiz creation tools, that
require registration in order to participate.<br><br>
Quia Corporation does not sell or rent user information to anyone. We will
notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be
shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not
permitting the transfer. If you do not wish to allow your data to be
shared, you can choose not to use a particular service or not to
participate in certain activities. <br><br>

<font face="arial,helvetica" size="+2">What is Quia Corporation's policy
on allowing me to update, correct, or delete my personally identifiable
information?</font><br>
You may edit your Quia account information at any time by  going to <a href="profileform.cgi">
http://www.quia.com/profileform.cgi</a>. If you have forgotten your  
password, go to the <a href="/servlets/quia.user.RequestPassword">Password 
      Request Form</a>. A new password will be automatically sent to the e-mail 
      address you specified during registration.  For all other problems signing in to Quia
Corporation, please contact <a href="/help.html">
Quia Support</a>.<br><br> 
Please contact <a href="/help.html">Quia Support</a> for
further instructions about deleting or deactivating your Quia Corporation

update your e-mail address on the promotions mailing list or to quit a
promotion and cease receiving promotion-related e-mail, please contact 
<a href="/help.html">
Quia Support</a>. <br><br>
 
<a href="#PA">Top</a><hr><br><a name="PI"></a>

<font face="arial,helvetica" size="+2">What security precautions are in
place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my
information?</font><br> 
Your Quia Corporation account information and Quia Corporation profile are
password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal
information. You may edit your Quia account information at any time by going to
<a href="profileform.cgi"> 
http://www.quia.com/profileform.cgi</a>. If you have forgotten your  
password, go to the <a href="/servlets/quia.user.RequestPassword">Password 
      Request Form</a>. A new password will be automatically sent to the e-mail 
      address you specified during registration.  For all other problems signing in to Quia
Corporation, please contact <a href="/help.html">
Quia Support.</a><br><br>  
We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Quia
Corporation will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone
call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Also remember to log out of Quia before
closing your browser. You can log out of Quia by clicking on
the log out link available on most Web pages, or by going to <a href="logout.cgi"> http://www.quia.com/logout.cgi</a>.
After logging out, make sure to close your browser window when you have
finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your
personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with
someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or
Internet cafe.<br><br> 
As a global company, Quia Corporation has international users all over the
world. When you give Quia Corporation personal information, that
information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country
where you originally entered the information, such as to the United States
or other countries. In addition, that information may be used, stored, and
processed outside of the country where you entered that information.
Whenever Quia Corporation handles personal information as described above,
regardless of where this occurs, Quia Corporation takes steps to ensure
that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the
relevant Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. <br><br> 
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless
network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive
to protect your personal information, Quia Corporation cannot ensure or
warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our
online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we
receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security
on our systems. <br><br>
 
<a href="#PA">Top</a><hr><br><a name="PJ"></a>

<font face="arial,helvetica" size="+2">What about children's
privacy?</font><br>
Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, no Web site operator
is permitted to require a child under the age of 13 to disclose more
information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as
a condition of participation. Quia Corporation abides by this requirement. 
Quia Corporation does not gather information on the ages of our users and will
never knowingly share personally identifying information about
users who are under the age of 13 with business partners or other third
parties. When contacting our users, Quia Corporation requests that anyone 
under the age of 13 forward the e-mail to a parent or guardian. All Quia account holders, including parents
and children with Quia accounts, are subject to this Privacy 
Policy.<br><br>
 
<a href="#PA">Top</a><hr><br><a name="PK"></a>

<font face="arial,helvetica" size="+2">
What else should I know about my privacy?</font><br>
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal
information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in
chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In
short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the
public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in
return.<br><br>  
When creating materials on the Quia Web site, you
must choose whether or not to show your name and e-mail address. If you
decide to show your name and e-mail address, you are making it available to
others over the Internet. Furthermore, if you have chosen to have your name 
displayed on your Quia activity page(s) and you nominate an activity for it
to appear on the Quia Directory, your name will appear in the directory.
Remember that the choice of displaying your name and e-mail address on the
Quia Web site is entirely up to you. By publishing your name and e-mail
address, you may receive correspondence from other Quia users. For
example, someone may send you an e-mail to let you know that your activity
is extremely helpful, or to point out errors in your activity. Many Quia
users appreciate the opportunity to receive this feedback; however, the
choice to include this information is yours.<br><br> 
Additionally, Quia offers a home-page building tool, specifically designed
to allow educators to custom build class pages for their own use. Just
like any other home page building tool, the home pages created can be
accessed by anyone over the Internet. Please do not include any
information on your home page that you do not want to disclose over the
Internet.<br><br> 
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your
passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and
responsible whenever you're
online. <br><br>
