      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ABOUT THE 
        PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This website 
        routinely collects information about its visitors, subscribers, members, 
        and customers. This information is obtained in various ways, such as:</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">VISITOR, 
        SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 'REGISTRATION'</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Registration 
        means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active, positive 
        steps to communicate information to this website. This can include pages 
        or 'pop ups' where you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing 
        list; it can include your participation in visitor surveys; it can include 
        requesting information from the website via email, mail, or courier; it 
        may be from joining an affiliate program or other membership organization, 
        paid or unpaid; or it may be from ordering a product.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Occasionally 
        complete credit card information may be provided to the website via fax 
        or a fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant service processing. 
        This information is kept at the highest level of security and is never 
        divulged to anyone except the merchant service provider or for the purpose 
        of communication with the customer.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ONLINE ORDERING</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Online ordering 
        via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart services supporting 
        merchant service companies like Visa and Master Card provides information 
        to the website but often does not provide complete credit card numbers. 
        In the process of online ordering, the customer provides, name, address, 
        city, state, email address, phone number, CVS (back of card) number, and, 
        occasionally a member password. You should consider all this information 
        available to the website. This information is used to deliver the product, 
        but under the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for general 
        solicitation purposes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">VISITOR EMAIL 
        INQUIRIES</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Website visitors 
        who wish to communicate with the website do so under two conditions: one, 
        they give their permission for contact by the website; two, they are subject 
        to the general 'SUBMISSION' agreement of this policy. While your email 
        address may or may not be used to solicit you, it is added to the website's 
        general solicitation database.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CUSTOMER 
        EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you are 
        a customer and send an email to the website, or if you communicate with 
        the site by phone or mail, the website collects information about your 
        communication and by communicating with the site you give your permission 
        to collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise use any information collected 
        as the site sees fit.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Any communication 
        which, in its sole discretion, the site deems to be a testimonial, may 
        be publicized for commercial purposes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> INFORMATION 
        OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS, OR SITE ADVERTISERS</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Visitors 
        clicking on banners or pop-ups or hyperlinked advertising, appearing on 
        this website must assume that information is being collected about them. 
        This site is not responsible for the use of information collected in such 
        a fashion. Visitors must assume that (1) information will be collected, 
        (2) that ‘cookies’ will usually be placed on their hard drive, 
        (3) that website does not have any control over what happens with this 
        information, (4) that website takes no responsibility over the accuracy 
        or content of advertisers, (5) that website is not responsible for downloads 
        from third party advertisers that contain viruses or worms or other computer

        itself or that the advertiser collects.</font></p>

        OBTAINED FROM REFERRING EMAIL OR REFERRING URLS</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you send 
        a friend an email from this site or if you send the URL or one of our 
        web pages to a friend, you must assume that some data is collected about 
        your IP address or your email address and that of your friend. You must 
        assume that referred emails or web pages may appear to come from your 
        email. You must accept full responsibility for referring pages or email 
        to a friend and agree to indemnify this site for any damage, intentional 
        or unintentional that results from said referrals.</font></p>

        OBTAINED FROM VOLUNTARY VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER OR CUSTOMER SURVEYS</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unless otherwise 
        specified in the survey, you must assume that any information provided 
        to the website as part of a survey in which you participate may be used 
        for general solicitation for commercial purposes and that such information 
        will be shared with joint venture partners, affiliates, marketing organization 
        or used by the site itself for product design or solicitation purposes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">INFORMATION 
        OBTAINED FROM ELECTRONIC MEANS AND 'COOKIES'</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many websites, 
        including this one, collect information about your computer, your email 
        address, and your IP address. You must assume that your web-viewing or 
        web-use activity is monitored, tracked, and information collected. This 
        information is not usually of a personal nature, but it may help define 
        your viewing habits and product preferences even though the website may 
        or may not have any idea who you are.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Cookies" 
        is web jargon for bits of computer code placed on your hard drive. Websites 
        use this to keep you 'logged in', to keep track of search criteria, to 
        monitor use, to password protect use of the site or use of products sold 
        by the site. Cookies can also be used to obtain information about your 
        computer configuration or your use of your computer.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cookies can 
        be used to electronically gather information about you. Again, it may 
        or may not be personal information, but it is information and by using 
        this site you are expressly giving permission to use 'cookies' and to 
        use the information gathered from their use to benefit you. You also give 
        permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and use any information collected 
        for product design, product offers to you, and general commercial solicitation 
        purposes by this site or joint venture partners, affiliates, and marketing 
        organizations.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HOW INFORMATION 
        MAY BE USED</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The use of 
        information as described below may or may not be how information that 
        is collected is customarily used by this site. While actual use of any 
        information collected may be used quite conservatively, you must assume 
        that it is not. You must assume that information collected is shared with 
        other persons or entities for commercial purposes. While this is uncommon 
        in practice, you must assume that it is as you make your decision whether 
        or not to view or interact with this website. This type of shared information 
        may include your name, address, phone number, email address and buying

        sold to, rented to, or shared with.</font></p>

        THAT IS NOT SHARED</font></p>

        information or other financial information is not usually known to the

        is never revealed to anyone except to processing authorities or law enforcement 
        agencies. However, the provider of such information gives express permission
