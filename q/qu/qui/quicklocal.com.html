        	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
           	<p>Midwest Venture Group, Inc, the developers of  QuickLocal.com and QuickLocal tools, understand and respect your concerns for  privacy. The purpose of this Privacy  Policy is to tell you what kind of information we may gather about you when you  visit our site, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to  anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to  correct this information. Our goal is to provide you with a satisfying  experience while allowing you to control your privacy and to give you a means  to voice any questions or concerns you may have. By using our websites you are  acknowledging and accepting this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h3>Collection of information</h3>
        <p>Information is collected primarily to  make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services. </p>
        <p>Midwest Venture Group, Inc [MVG] mostly collects  anonymous information through QuickLocal and other websites it operates. For  instance, we may collect information to tell us that five thousand people visit  this Privacy Policy today, but we do not know their names, where they live or  their date of birth - they are 'anonymous' to us. If you you are asked to  provide your name, email address and other information and you provide your  personal information, you are not anonymous to MVG.</p>
        <h3>Use of anonymous information</h3>
        <p>MVG automatically gathers anonymous  information to monitor the use of our platform like the numbers and frequency  of visitors to MVG sites and its areas, very much like television ratings that  tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data  in an aggregate way. This collective data helps us determine how much our  audiences use parts of the site, so we can improve our services. MVG may  publish or provide this aggregate data to other people.</p>

        <h3>Use of personal information</h3>
        <p>MVG will only use the personal  information you have chosen to provide us for the purpose for which you  provided it. MVG will not use it for any other purpose without your consent.</p>
        <h3>Cookies/Third Parties</h3>
        <p>From time to time, MVG or its advertisers  may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is  sent to your Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's  hard drive. A cookie can not read data off of your computer hard disk or read  cookie files created by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system.</p>
        <p>MVG uses cookies to store your  preferences, and some of our advertisers use them to ascertain how many times  you've seen an advertisement. Our advertisers may use this information to  better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you see on our  site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your  Internet browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow  your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent.

        <h3>No sale of personal information</h3>
        <p>Under no circumstances will MVG sell or  receive payment for licensing or disclosing your personal information.</p>
        <h3>Links</h3>
        <p>MVG properties may contain links to  third-party websites. MVG is not responsible for the privacy practices or the  content of such websites.</p>
