                <h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

                <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information from your computer when you browse our Website.
                    This means that, unless you voluntarily provide us with your personally identifiable information,
                    such as an email address or name, we will not know your name, your e-mail address, or any other
                    personally identifiable information. There may be circumstances, however, where you voluntarily
                    provide information to us, or where QuickAppNinja, its partners or affiliates, may request
                    information from you in order to provide certain requested Services. </p>

                <p>You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may
                    choose to give us information such as your name, address, or e-mail in order to correspond with us,
                    to process an order, or for us to provide you with a subscription to our Services. When using our
                    Services, you may need to provide us with your credit card information, or provide us with personal
                    information concerning your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at
                    QuickAppNinja, in the form of a résumé or a Curriculum Vitae ("CV"). We respect your choices
                    regarding use of personal information provided to us, and you have the option of requesting that
                    your personal information not be used beyond fulfilling your request for Services or other
                    information.. In addition to personal information that may be collected from you, QuickAppNinja may
                    automatically collect certain technical information, including Media Access Control ("MAC") address,
                    mobile device identifiers (if used to access the Website or Services), International Mobile
                    Equipment Identity ("IMEI"), and time-stamped logs of messages sent and received, and network status
                    (WiFi, etc.) We collect this information in order to make the Website and Services function
                    correctly and to provide you with the content that you see on the Website.</p>

                <p>Unless expressly provided otherwise, personal information that you provide while you are visiting the
                    website of a partner or affiliate of QuickAppNinja will be subject to the privacy policy posted on
                    that partner or affiliates website, and personal information that you provide while on our Website
                    in conjunction with that partners or affiliates service will be subject to this Privacy Policy.
                    For instance, credit card or PayPal® information entered as part of the filling out a purchase form
                    or registration process collected by a third partys registration and/or merchant services is
                    subject to that third partys privacy policies. You should be aware that QuickAppNinja agreements
                    with service providers, partners, or affiliates, often provide that they will share with QuickAppNinja
                    personal information collected from you. In such instances, QuickAppNinja may use this
                    information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <p>The following paragraphs describe in more detail how QuickAppNinja may use your personal information

                    or more of the paragraphs may apply. For example, if you order a product from a QuickAppNinja

                <p>We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its quality. We implement appropriate
                    measures and processes, such as using encryption software when transmitting certain sensitive

                    transactions wherever possible.</p>

                <h3>SERVICE QUALITY MONITORING BY PHONE</h3>

                <p>Certain transactions that users perform on our Website may also involve contact between users and
                    QuickAppNinja by phone. Please be aware that it is QuickAppNinja' general practice to monitor and
                    in some cases record such calls for staff training or quality assurance purposes.</p>

                <h3>PERSONALISED URL LINK</h3>

                <p>On occasion, we may personalise and customise websites for certain visitors. If you visit one of
                    these sites, you may find it customised with references to products and/or services that we believe
                    may be of interest to you, based on your previous interactions with QuickAppNinja and information
                    you have provided to us. While you are visiting these websites, we may collect information about
                    your visit to better tailor the site to your interests. An invitation to visit one of these websites
                    is usually presented as a personalised URL in an e-mail, a notice on a website registration page, or
                    as a response to you logging on to a certain website.</p>

                <p>If you choose to visit one of these websites, you are agreeing to let QuickAppNinja collect
                    information about your visits and also to QuickAppNinja use and association of such collected
                    information with other information about you and your relationship with QuickAppNinja. If you do
                    not wish your information to be used in this way, do not accept the invitation to visit these

                    information without your permission in limited circumstances. We will only do so if we have a
                    good-faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with laws, regulations, or
                    government requests; or (2) to investigate or protect against harmful activities to our guests,
                    visitors, partners, affiliates, or property (including the Website), or to others. If we are
                    required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide your personally identifiable
                    information, we will only do so upon receipt of appropriate documentation. We may also disclose
                    personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information
                    is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating this
                    Privacy Policy, the terms of their agreements with QuickAppNinja, or to protect the safety of our
                    users and the public. We may also disclose your information to investigate violations of our Terms
                    of Service disclosures, available at https://quickappninja.com/terms-and-conditions/. Please know that we do not
