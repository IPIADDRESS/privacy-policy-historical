                <h3>CHANGES IN THE PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

                <p>QUICKAPP NINJA reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting such changes
                    on its Website. Please check the revision date to determine if this Privacy Policy has been modified
                    since you last reviewed it. Your continued use of any portion of the QUICKAPP NINJA Website, or
                    Services subsequent to the posting of an updated Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of
                    all such changes.</p>

                <p>We want you to always be aware of what personal and other information we collect, how we use it, and
                    under what circumstances we may disclose it. All personal information we collect will be handled
                    according to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the information is collected. If the Privacy
                    Policy changes in any significant respect, we will not use your personal data in a manner that is
                    inconsistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time your information was collected without
                    your permission. </p>

                <p>From time to time, we may find the need to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Upon notice given by
                    one or more of the following means: upon notice given to you after you login to your Account (as
                    such term defined in Terms of Service http://www.quickappninja.com/tos/), by email communication to
                    the email address provided by you when you setup your account or otherwise on record for your
                    account, or by written mail communication to the address on record for your account. You will be
                    given the opportunity to opt-out, provided that, if you choose to opt-out all or part of the service
                    or products may no longer be available to you. If as the result of such changes, you want to alter
                    the ways in which QUICKAPP NINJA is allowed to use your personal information, you can do so by
                    following the procedure described in Section Creating and Updating Your Personal Account and
                    Preferences. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, and will be subject to, the changes to
                    the Privacy Policy by your continued use of the service or products after such notice has been given
                    with the following exception: if at the time you provide personal information to QUICKAPP NINJA you
                    limit how such information will be used to communicate with you, either by QUICKAPP NINJA or by
                    third parties, QUICKAPP NINJA will not change your preference in this regard without your express
                    consent.</p>

                <h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

                <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information from your computer when you browse our Website.
                    This means that, unless you voluntarily provide us with your personally identifiable information,
                    such as an email address or name, we will not know your name, your e-mail address, or any other
                    personally identifiable information. There may be circumstances, however, where you voluntarily
                    provide information to us, or where QUICKAPP NINJA, its partners or affiliates, may request
                    information from you in order to provide certain requested Services. </p>

                <p>You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may
                    choose to give us information such as your name, address, or e-mail in order to correspond with us,
                    to process an order, or for us to provide you with a subscription to our Services. When using our
                    Services, you may need to provide us with your credit card information, or provide us with personal
                    information concerning your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at
                    QUICKAPP NINJA, in the form of a résumé or a Curriculum Vitae (CV). We respect your choices
                    regarding use of personal information provided to us, and you have the option of requesting that
                    your personal information not be used beyond fulfilling your request for Services or other
                    information.. In addition to personal information that may be collected from you, QUICKAPP NINJA may
                    automatically collect certain technical information, including Media Access Control (MAC) address,
                    mobile device identifiers (if used to access the Website or Services), International Mobile
                    Equipment Identity (IMEI), and time-stamped logs of messages sent and received, and network status
                    (WiFi, etc.) We collect this information in order to make the Website and Services function
                    correctly and to provide you with the content that you see on the Website.</p>

                <p>Unless expressly provided otherwise, personal information that you provide while you are visiting the
                    website of a partner or affiliate of QUICKAPP NINJA will be subject to the privacy policy posted on
                    that partner or affiliates website, and personal information that you provide while on our Website
                    in conjunction with that partners or affiliates service will be subject to this Privacy Policy.
                    For instance, credit card or PayPal® information entered as part of the filling out a purchase form
                    or registration process collected by a third partys registration and/or merchant services is
                    subject to that third partys privacy policies. You should be aware that QUICKAPP NINJA agreements
                    with service providers, partners, or affiliates, often provide that they will share with QUICKAPP
                    NINJA personal information collected from you. In such instances, QUICKAPP NINJA may use this
                    information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h3>USING AND SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

                <p>The following paragraphs describe in more detail how QUICKAPP NINJA may use your personal information
                    and with whom we may share it. Depending on the type of QUICKAPP NINJA Website you are visiting, one
                    or more of the paragraphs may apply. For example, if you order a product from a QUICKAPP NINJA
                    Website, your information will be handled as described in such paragraphs as Fulfilling Your
                    Transaction Request and Marketing Use.</p>

                <h3>FULFILLING YOUR TRANSACTION REQUEST</h3>

                <p>If you request a Service from the QUICKAPP NINJA Website, or for example, a callback, or specific
                    marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfil your request. To help us do
                    this, we may share information with other service providers, or with other parts of QUICKAPP NINJA,
                    QUICKAPP NINJA' Business Partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal or government
                    authorities (for example, U.S. or international Customs authorities for international shipments), or
                    as otherwise required or permitted by law, as further detailed in our Disclosures Required By Law
                    section below. In connection with a transaction we may also contact you as part of our customer
                    satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.</p>

                <h3>MARKETING USE</h3>

                <p>The information you provide to QUICKAPP NINJA on certain QUICKAPP NINJA websites may also be used by
                    QUICKAPP NINJA and selected third parties for marketing purposes. Before we use it, however, we will
                    offer you the opportunity to choose whether or not to have your information used in this way.
                    Additionally, you are always free to opt-out or unsubscribe from marketing lists, surveys or
                    other email communications that we may occasionally send by contacting us at
                    support@quickappninja.com and requesting that your email be removed from our emailing lists.</p>

                <h3>QUICKAPP NINJA HUMAN RESOURCES WEBSITES (INCLUDING RECRUITMENT)</h3>

                <p>QUICKAPP NINJA is committed to protecting the privacy of applicants who apply for positions through
                    any of the QUICKAPP NINJA websites. You may provide us with information about yourself, such as a

                    to the EU Directives concerning personal data, privacy and electronic communications, including but
                    not limited to Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002
                    concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic

                <h3>INFORMATION SECURITY AND QUALITY</h3>

                <p>We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its quality. We implement appropriate
                    measures and processes, such as using encryption software when transmitting certain sensitive
                    information, to help us to keep your information secure and to maintain its quality.</p>

                <h3>SUPPLEMENTING INFORMATION</h3>

                <p>From time to time we may supplement information you provide to us via the QUICKAPP NINJA Website with
                    information from other sources, such as information validating your Internet Protocol (IP) address
                    or other available information about businesses. This is done to help us maintain the accuracy of
                    the information we collect, to improve the Website, and to help us provide you with better
                    services.</p>

                <h3>USE OF SUPPLIERS</h3>

                <p>QUICKAPP NINJA may use suppliers to collect, use, analyse and otherwise process information on its
                    behalf. It is QUICKAPP NINJA' practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner
                    consistent with QUICKAPP NINJA' data collection policies and privacy protections. </p>

                <p>If you would like more information about our suppliers, please contact us at
                    support@quickappninja.com</p>

                <h3>MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS</h3>

                <p>Circumstances may arise in which, whether for strategic or other business reasons, QUICKAPP NINJA
                    decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganise it businesses. In such transactions, customer
                    information generally is one of the transferred business assets but will remain subject to any
                    pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the event
                    that QUICKAPP NINJA, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information may be one of
                    the transferred assets. These transactions may involve the disclosure of personal information to
                    prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving such information from sellers. It is QUICKAPP NINJA´
                    practice to seek appropriate protection for all disclosed personal information in these types of
                    transactions wherever possible.</p>

                <h3>COOKIES, WEB BEACONS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES</h3>

                <p>The QUICKAPP NINJA Website uses cookie and web beacon technology. Cookies are short pieces of
                    data generated by a web server that a website stores on a users computer. Certain pages on our
                    Website may require the use of a cookie for purposes of keeping information you enter on multiple
                    pages together. Cookies also enable us to collect certain non-identifiable information and customise
                    our Website and offerings to your needs and provide you with a better online experience with
                    us. </p>

                <p>For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor
                    activity on QUICKAPP NINJA Web sites, but we do so in ways that keep the information
                    non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data" and QUICKAPP NINJA, its
                    partners, affiliates, or others on QUICKAPP NINJA' behalf may use this data to analyse trends and
                    statistics and to help us provide better customer service. </p>

                <p class="margin-small">In addition, cookies are used to:</p>

                <p class="margin-small">*) measure usage of various pages on our Website to help us make our information
                    more pertinent to your needs and easy for you to access;</p>

                <p class="margin-small">*) identify and categorised the internet webpages from which the visitor came to
                    the Website and observe their browsing patterns; and</p>

                <p>*) provide functionality such as online orders, QUICKAPP NINJA Services and other functions that we
                    believe would be of interest and value to you.</p>

                <p>The types of cookies that we use are referred to as session cookies and persistent cookies.
                    Session cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted once you leave the Website. Persistent
                    cookies remain on your computer hard drive until you delete them. Cookies do not, under ordinary
                    circumstances, corrupt or damage your computer, programs, or computer files.</p>

                <p>In addition, the service providers we use to serve and host our advertisements, and/or deliver our
                    e-mails may use session and persistent cookies, to track the number of times the Website is accessed
                    and whether the site was accessed from an advertisement. There are no cookies in the advertisements
                    or e-mails. A cookie is placed on your computer only if and when you click on an advertisement or
                    open the e-mail. The cookie generated from the advertisement or e-mail does not contain any
                    personally identifiable information and will remain on your hard drive until you delete it.</p>
                pYou may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how
                to do this), although doing so may adversely affect your ability to perform certain transactions, use
                certain functionality and access certain content on our Website. Please also note that if you turn off
                cookies, web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to our website, but the notices they
                generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded.
                <p>Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to help website operators understand how visitors
                    interact with their websites. A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel
                    x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. As opposed to cookies, which are stored on a users computer
                    hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at
                    the end of this sentence. These web beacons are not tied to personally identifiable information. The
                    use of a web beacons allows the site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that
                    contains the web beacon. It makes it easier to follow and record the activities of a recognised
                    browser, such as the path of pages visited at a website. QUICKAPP NINJA may use the information
                    provided by web beacons to develop a better understanding of how the Websites users use the
                    Website, and to facilitate those users interactions with the Website. QUICKAPP NINJA may make the
                    aggregate data obtained from web analytics (including from our third party analytics providers, if
                    applicable) publicly available. If this data is made available, none of the information will be
                    personally identifying information or potentially-personally identifying information.</p>

                <p>Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about
                    that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-personally identifiable
                    information such as click-stream data. This information is used and analysed only at an aggregate
                    level to help us understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual
                    level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies
                    through your web browser.</p>

                <h3>SERVICE QUALITY MONITORING BY PHONE</h3>

                <p>Certain transactions that users perform on our Website may also involve contact between users and
                    QUICKAPP NINJA by phone. Please be aware that it is QUICKAPP NINJA' general practice to monitor and
                    in some cases record such calls for staff training or quality assurance purposes.</p>

                <h3>PERSONALISED URL LINK</h3>

                <p>On occasion, we may personalise and customise websites for certain visitors. If you visit one of
                    these sites, you may find it customised with references to products and/or services that we believe
                    may be of interest to you, based on your previous interactions with QUICKAPP NINJA and information
                    you have provided to us. While you are visiting these websites, we may collect information about
                    your visit to better tailor the site to your interests. An invitation to visit one of these websites
                    is usually presented as a personalised URL in an e-mail, a notice on a website registration page, or
                    as a response to you logging on to a certain website.</p>

                <p>If you choose to visit one of these websites, you are agreeing to let QUICKAPP NINJA collect
                    information about your visits and also to QUICKAPP NINJA use and association of such collected
                    information with other information about you and your relationship with QUICKAPP NINJA. If you do
                    not wish your information to be used in this way, do not accept the invitation to visit these
                    sites.</p>

                <h3>DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY LAW</h3>

                <p>Although we will always strive to guard your identity, we may disclose your personally identifiable
                    information without your permission in limited circumstances. We will only do so if we have a
                    good-faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with laws, regulations, or
                    government requests; or (2) to investigate or protect against harmful activities to our guests,
                    visitors, partners, affiliates, or property (including the Website), or to others. If we are
                    required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide your personally identifiable
                    information, we will only do so upon receipt of appropriate documentation. We may also disclose
                    personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information
                    is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating this
                    Privacy Policy, the terms of their agreements with QUICKAPP NINJA, or to protect the safety of our
                    users and the public. We may also disclose your information to investigate violations of our Terms
                    of Service disclosures, available at http://www.quickappninja.com/tos/. Please know that we do not
                    take this responsibility lightly. Your privacy is of paramount importance to us.</p>
