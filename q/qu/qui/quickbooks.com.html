To demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices, we have adopted leading industry privacy guidelines. Intuit is a Premier Sponsor of TRUSTe and a member of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.</p>

<p>This privacy statement defines privacy aspects specific to QuickBooks, QuickBooks.com, QuickBooks for the Web, and affiliated Intuit Web servers (together referred to as the "QuickBooks Web sites"). It serves as an adjunct to the <a href="http://privacy.intuit.com/policies/" class="ContentLink">Intuit Online Privacy Policy</a>, which represents our general privacy philosophy and governs all of our Web sites. The QuickBooks Web site's privacy practices are consistent and compliant with that policy.</p>

We want to give you the comfort and confidence you need to fully participate in our product &amp; service offerings so that we can better serve your needs. Therefore, here are the principles governing our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web sites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#Notice" class="ContentLink">We provide you notice of our information practices.</a>

To maximize the value of our services, we may request information from you when you visit our Web sites or register our products. When we collect information from you, we'll tell you what is being collected, how it is collected, by whom it is being collected, why it is being collected and to whom it may be disclosed. We identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request. Whenever we ask for additional or optional information, we identify those fields appropriately so that you know what is required to provide the requested service.</p>

<p>Whenever you register a product or service, we request certain personally identifiable information, including your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and company name. We use this information to notify you about upcoming product upgrades and about special offers available to registered users.

<p><a name="Technologies"><span class="ContentBold">We tell you how and why we use Web technologies.</span></a><br>

Here is how and why we use some common technologies to help manage our Web site:</p>

<p><span class="ContentBold">Cookies.</span> A "cookie" is a small piece of information that our Web site may provide to your browser while you are at our site. QuickBooks products &amp; services supply your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas). Except in registered areas these cookies are not linked to the personally identifiable information that you provide us elsewhere on the site. You do not have to accept cookies from our site. Only the areas that require registration require cookies. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies.</p>

<p>When you use the <a href="https://login.quickbooks.com/" class="ContentLink">QuickBooks Universal Login</a> for one of the QuickBooks services, you will receive a cookie as part of the personal identification process. This cookie will be used to confirm your identity each time you wish to access one of our services. The cookie enables you to go from screen to screen without being repeatedly asked to authenticate your identity.</p>

<p>Third party tracking systems in use on behalf of this Web site may assign different cookies to you. These cookies may be used to track your involvement with certain links on our site to help us better understand and improve our site. You may choose not to accept these cookies and will still have full access to site functionality. These cookies do not follow you once you leave our site, nor are they linked to personal information you provide elsewhere on our site. If you have any questions about our third party tracking system, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@intuit.com" class="ContentLink">privacy@intuit.com</a>.</p>

<ul>

<li><span class="ContentBold">Web Site Usage Data.</span> With or without cookies, our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL. We use this data to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer. This information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting. This log information is not linked to personally identifiable information gathered elsewhere on the site.<br>
<br>

</li><li><span class="ContentBold">Co-branded and Third-Party Sites.</span> Our co-branded sites are clearly identified by both an Intuit and a partner's logo. The QuickBooks products &amp; services may provide links to third-party Web sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. On these sites either Intuit and/or its partners may collect information about you. Intuit is not responsible for the actions of these third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>

</li><li><span class="ContentBold">Links to the Internet.</span> Newer versions of QuickBooks software are "Internet enabled," allowing us to deliver products, services and information via the World Wide Web. In providing these services, your QuickBooks software will sometimes link to Web sites on the Internet after you click on a link or a message within the QuickBooks software. Links leading to the Internet are distinguished by a lightning-bolt icon. After clicking on one of those links, you will pass through an Intuit server before being "re-directed" onto the Internet. This allows QuickBooks to send you to the proper Web site even if the destination Web site has changed locations. We store which message you clicked on and its location within the software prior to linking you to the Internet. Intuit servers register the Web site you request from within the software. Intuit does not register your surfing behavior after that point. We use this information, in the aggregate, to determine usage levels for our various on-line services.

</li></ul>

<p class="ContentBold">More on our general information practices:</p>

<ul>

<li><span class="ContentBold">Mandatory and Optional Information.</span> We identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request. Whenever we ask for additional or optional information, we identify those fields appropriately so that you know what is required to provide the requested service.<br>
<br>

</li><li><span class="ContentBold">E-mail Message Formatting.</span> When sending you e-mail we may use an image called a single-pixel GIF, that allows us to (1) format messages that best align with your computer's capabilities, and (2) determine whether you've opened an HTML e-mail. When you click on a link within an e-mail message, you will first pass through our server, then be redirected onto the Internet. We use this data on an aggregate level to evaluate response rates to our e-mail messages and to determine which links are most useful to our customer base.<br>
<br>

</li><li><span class="ContentBold">Service Providers.</span> In some cases, we will employ or work with service providers such as consultants, temporary workers, third party software developers, or outsourcers to complete a business process or provide a service on our behalf. For example we may use service providers to deliver products, offer online software applications, or send e-mails. When we employ service providers we may need to share your personally identifiable information. Service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for purposes other than to act on our behalf.<br>
<br>

</li><li><span class="ContentBold">Change of Control.</span> Your personally identifiable information may be transferred in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of Intuit and/or its subsidiaries. You will have the opportunity to opt out of further secondary use of your information following any change of control.<br>
<br>

</li><li><span class="ContentBold">Changes to Our Privacy Policy.</span> If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we'll post those changes to the QuickBooks.com Web site 30 days before they take effect.<br>
<br>

</li><li><span class="ContentBold">Legal Disclosures.</span> In some cases we may be required to disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant.

<p>You can obtain these downloads in two different ways. The easiest is by using QuickBooks' Automatic Update feature. When an important update is available, QuickBooks uses the current Internet connection to download and install the update. Everything happens in the background, without disturbing current tasks or slowing down the computer. The software is updated while you work.</p>

<p>With the Automatic Update feature, QuickBooks only connects to Intuit servers when you are already connected to the Internet. The update feature uses a secure connection to transmit technical information to Intuit about the computer's connection and the QuickBooks software being updated. Under no circumstances do Intuit servers access or read any other information on your computer. During an update, QuickBooks downloads only the necessary files to the PC.</p>

<p>You always have the option of turning off this feature. To do this, go to the "File" menu within QuickBooks, select "Update QuickBooks" then click the "Update Options" link and follow the instructions. You will still be able to get the latest updates manually by visiting <a href="http://www.quickbooks.com/support/updates.html" class="ContentLink">http://www.quickbooks.com/support/updates.html</a>.</p>

<p>The QuickBooks Shopping Source allows you to purchase a variety of goods and services. QuickBooks provides an entryway into the service, but does not actually execute the product search or the order fulfillment.</p>

<p>To utilize the service, the company and individual purchasers must register at the time of purchase on QuickBooks Shopping Source. The information required to utilize the service to execute an order is company name, address, phone number, and e-mail. We additionally ask for your company's URL and Duns# which may be supplied on an optional basis. The required information is used to register your company to utilize the service. The optional information is requested in the event that you may want to offer your own products or services through this virtual marketplace. Additionally, the name, phone number, and e-mail for each authorized purchaser will be required to purchase items. Metiom, Inc., provider of the shopping functionality, will only use the information you share in aggregate form. If you choose to utilize the service by purchasing items, your personally identifiable information will be shared with the vendors you've chosen so they can gather the information required to collect payment and deliver the requested products to you. At the time of the transaction, additional personally identifiable information may be gathered. The information shared during a transaction may only be used by the vendors to market products or services to you within the QuickBooks Shopping Source and then only with the approval of Intuit, subject to the privacy preferences defined by you.</p>

<p>The QuickBooks Merchant Account Service allows you to accept payment by credit card from your customers. In order to utilize this service your company must apply for a merchant account with one of our merchant bank partners. To apply for the Merchant Account Service, you will be required to supply the bank your company name, address, phone number, e-mail address, description of your products and/or services and detailed financial and operational information on your company. This information is used by the merchant bank for making a credit decision on your application. If they extend you credit, you become their customer and become subject to their privacy practices. Please see their privacy statements for further details on their practices.</p>

<p>If your application for an account is approved, information sufficient to uniquely identify your account is shared by our merchant bank partner with our Internet transaction processor partner, and then forwarded to Intuit. This information includes company name, address, phone and e-mail address. This information is used by the Internet transaction processor partner only for the purpose of fulfilling the transaction. The e-mail address is only used to confirm your account and to provide critical service announcements.</p>

<p>QuickBooks Merchant Account Service allows you to download customer payments directly into QuickBooks thereby avoiding having to reenter transaction information. To enable this service the Internet transaction processor and merchant bank partners forward transaction information to an Intuit server from which you may download the information at your convenience. QuickBooks may use this information to track our partner's performance and to improve the design and functionality of this service.</p>
