<p class="Title">QuickBooks.com Privacy Statement</p>

<p>At Intuit, we dedicate ourselves to revolutionizing the way individuals and small businesses manage their financial lives. In that effort, we respect and protect the privacy of those who visit or use our Web sites. We want you to know how your information is used. To demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices, we have adopted leading industry privacy guidelines.</p>

<p>This privacy statement defines privacy aspects specific to the QuickBooks.com Web site and affiliated Intuit Web servers (referred to as the "QuickBooks Web site"). It serves as an adjunct to the <a href="http://privacy.intuit.com/policies/">Intuit Online Privacy Policy</a>, which represents our general privacy philosophy and governs all of our Web sites. The QuickBooks Web site's privacy practices are consistent and compliant with that policy.</p>

<p>Because of the financial nature of our business, our Web sites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. Therefore, we don't knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children.</p>

<p><span class="Header">Our Philosophy and Practices</span><br>
We want to give you the comfort and confidence you need to fully participate in our online offerings so that we can better serve your needs. Therefore, here are the principles governing our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web site:</p>

<ul type="square">
<li><a href="#Notice">We provide you notice of our Web site information practices</a>.
</li><li><a href="#Choices">We give you choices about how the personally identifiable information that you provide us may be used</a>.
</li><li><a href="#Update">We let you update or correct the personally identifiable information that you provide us</a>.
</li><li><a href="#Protect">We work to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration</a>.
</li><li><a href="#Contact">We provide various ways for you to contact us about our information practices and other privacy aspects</a>.
</li></ul>

<p><a name="Notice"><img src="images/pixels/purple.gif" width="455" height="1"></a></p>

<p><span class="HeaderPurple">WE PROVIDE YOU NOTICE OF OUR WEB SITE INFORMATION PRACTICES.</span><br>
To maximize the value of our services, we may request information from you when you visit our Web sites. When we collect information from you, we'll tell you what is being collected, how it is collected, by whom it is being collected, why it is being collected and to whom it may be disclosed.</p>

<p>Here is how and why we collect and use information from you:</p>
<ul type="square">
<li><span class="BodyBold">Submitting Suggestions</span>. Using our Web site, you can ask us questions and share comments with us. Through our submission request form, we provide you a chance to send specific questions or comments and we request, at your option, a name and e-mail address, so that we may respond to your inquiry. All submissions through this form are treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary, and may be published or used by Intuit for other purposes.<br><br>
</li><li><span class="BodyBold">Site Builder Registration</span>. We provide you the opportunity to build and register your own Web site using QuickBooks Site Builder. During the registration process, we request your name, address, phone number, fax number (optional), and e-mail address. We need the name, address and phone number information to build your site and to register it with the Web's domain name registrar. Failure to supply this information will result in an inability to complete your site and register your domain name. The e-mail address you supply is published on the site you build, is used to forward customer e-mail to you and is the way we contact you with news and service information about your site. If you do not want to receive our Site Solution Newsletters, you may opt out during the registration process or follow the instructions contained in each newsletter. We do not share this information without your permission with any third parties other than those required to register your domain name.<br><br>
</li><li><span class="BodyBold">Site Center</span>. After building your Web site using QuickBooks Site Builder, we give you the opportunity to sign up for special offers from our partners. The information you share on these pages will be subject to our partner's privacy practices. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these partners before signing up for the services.<br><br>
</li><li><span class="BodyBold">Newsletters</span>. We provide you the opportunity to subscribe to e-mail newsletters and other e-mail communications. You may unsubscribe by following the instructions provided in each e-mail newsletter.<br><br>
</li><li><span class="BodyBold">Contests and Surveys</span>. From time to time, we may offer you the option to participate in contests or surveys. If you would like to participate, we may ask you for contact information, preferences, or other information. This information may be used to conduct research, improve our offerings, or award prizes. Our contests may have separate rules and we will identify how the information that you supply will be used in each case.<br><br>
</li><li><span class="BodyBold">Mandatory and Optional Information</span>. We identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request. Whenever we ask for additional or optional information, we identify those fields appropriately so that you know what is required to provide the requested service.
</li></ul>

<p><br><span class="HeaderPurple">HOW WE USE WEB TECHNOLOGY:</span><br>
Here is how and why we use some common Web technologies to help manage our Web site:</p>
<ul type="square">
<li><span class="BodyBold">Cookies</span>. A "cookie" is a small piece of information that our Web site may provide to your browser while you are at our site. The QuickBooks Web site supplies your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas).<br><br>
If you simply want to browse, you do not have to accept cookies from our site. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies.<br><br>
Advertising networks that serve ads on this Web site may assign different cookies to you. Those cookies may be used to track your involvement with the advertising on our site. You may choose not to accept these cookies. Intuit does not control those parties. You should review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use private information. If you have questions about our ad serving networks, please contact us at <a href="https://orderupdate.intuit.com/record.asp?topic=privacy">privacy@intuit.com</a>.<br><br>
</li><li><span class="BodyBold">Web Site Usage Data</span>. With or without cookies, our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL. We use this data to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer. This information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting.<br><br>
</li><li><span class="BodyBold">Co-branded and Third-Party Sites</span>. Our co-branded sites are clearly identified by both an Intuit and a partner's logo. The QuickBooks Web site may provide links to third-party Web sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. On these sites either Intuit and/or its partners may collect information about you. Intuit is not responsible for the actions of these third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personally identifiable information.
</li></ul>

<p>If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we'll post those changes to this privacy statement 30 days before they take effect.</p>

<p>In some cases we may be required to disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant.</p>
