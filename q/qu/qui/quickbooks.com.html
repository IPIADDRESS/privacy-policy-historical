<b>QuickBooks 2002, QuickBooks.com &amp; QuickBooks Online Edition Privacy Statement</b>

<p><a href="https://www.truste.org/validate/8257"><img src="images/ClickSeal.gif" width="91" height="73" align="right" border="0" alt="TRUSTe: Click to Verify"></a>
At Intuit, we dedicate ourselves to revolutionizing the way individuals manage 
their financial lives and small businesses manage their business. In that effort, we 
respect and protect the privacy of those who visit or use our Web sites. When we 
collect information from you, we want you to know how it is used. To demonstrate 
our commitment to fair information practices, we have adopted leading industry 
privacy guidelines. Intuit is a Premier Sponsor of TRUSTe and a member of the 
TRUSTe Privacy Program.</p>

<p>This privacy statement defines privacy aspects specific to QuickBooks, 
QuickBooks.com, QuickBooks Online Edition, and affiliated Intuit Web servers 
(together referred to as the "QuickBooks Web sites"). 
It serves as an adjunct to the <a href="http://privacy.intuit.com/policies/">Intuit 
Online Privacy Policy</a>, which represents our general privacy philosophy and governs 
all of our Web sites. The QuickBooks Web site's privacy practices are consistent and 
compliant with that policy.</p>

<p>Because of the financial nature of our business, our products &amp; services are not 
designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. Therefore, we don't knowingly attempt 
to solicit or receive any information from children.</p>

<p><a name="Technologies" class="Anchor"><b>We tell you how and why we use Web technologies.</b></a><br>
Here is how and why we use some common technologies to help manage our Web site:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Cookies.</b> A "cookie" is a small piece of information that our Web 
site may provide to your browser while you are at our site. QuickBooks products &amp; 
services supply your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to 
better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our 
site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas). You may receive 
additional cookies when you request a service through this site.<br>
<br>
If you simply want to browse, you do not have to accept cookies from our site. Should you decide, however, that you would like to request a service and you have modified your browser settings not to accept cookies, you will need to re-set your browser to accept the cookies that we send it. Otherwise, you may not be able to use certain areas of the Web sites. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies.<br>
<br>
When you use the <a href="https://login.quickbooks.com/">QuickBooks Business Services Login</a> 
for one of the QuickBooks services, you will receive a cookie as part of the personal 
identification process. This cookie will be used to confirm your identity each time you 
wish to access one of our services. The cookie enables you to go from screen to screen 
without being repeatedly asked to authenticate your identity.<br>
<br>
Third party tracking systems in use on behalf of this Web site may assign different 
cookies to you. These cookies may be used to track your involvement with certain links 
on our site to help us better understand and improve our site. You may choose not to 
accept these cookies and will still have full access to site functionality. These cookies 
do not follow you once you leave our site, nor are they linked to personal information 
you provide elsewhere on our site. If you have any questions about our third party 
tracking system, please contact us at 
<a href="http://privacy.intuit.com/">http://privacy.intuit.com</a>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Links to the Internet.</b> Newer versions of QuickBooks software are 
"Internet enabled," allowing us to deliver products, services and 
information via the World Wide Web. In providing these services, your QuickBooks 
software will sometimes link to Web sites on the Internet after you click on a 
link or a message within the QuickBooks software. Links leading to the Internet 
are distinguished by a lightning-bolt icon. After clicking on one of those links, 
you will pass through an Intuit server before being "re-directed" onto 
the Internet. This allows QuickBooks to send you to the proper Web site even if the 
destination Web site has changed locations. We store which message you clicked on and 
its location within the software prior to linking you to the Internet. Intuit servers 
register the Web site you request from within the software. Intuit does not register 
your surfing behavior after that point.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Web Site and Intuit Server Usage Data.</b> Our Web site — as well as servers 
used to support Internet enabled services from within our software product — track 
usage data, including, for example, your IP address, your browser type and version, 
which pages you view, which page, if any, linked you to our site, and which link, 
if any, you follow off of our site. We use this data in the aggregate to better 
understand Web site and product activity to improve our offerings.  We may also 
use this data to provide you a more personalized Web site experience, assistance 
with technical support questions, and to send you special offers, product and service 
updates, or other promotional materials that are relevant and tailored to your 
interests. If you do not wish to receive these offers or promotions, simply 
indicate your contact preferences during the registration process or by visiting 
<a href="https://privacy.intuit.com">https://privacy.intuit.com</a>. We do not share your 
information with outside companies for their promotional use.  We do not track 
URLs that you type into your browser, nor do we track you across the Internet 
once you leave our site.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>More on our general information practices:</b></p>

<ul>

<li><b>Mandatory and Optional Information.</b> We identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request. Whenever we ask for additional or optional information, we identify those fields appropriately so that you know what is required to provide the requested service. If you choose not to provide mandatory information, we will not be able to provide you with the service you are requesting.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Intuit Partners and Co-branded or Third-Party Sites.</b> Some of the products and services we offer are provided by Intuit's business partners. To fulfill your request for such services, we will forward your customer information to our partner, as necessary. When offering partner services on an Intuit or a co-branded site, the partner who will be receiving the information will be clearly identified. The QuickBooks products and services may provide links to third-party Web sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. On these sites either Intuit and/or its partners may collect information about you. Intuit is not responsible for the actions of these third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personally identifiable information.<br><br></li>

<a name="email_messaging"><br></a>
<li><b>E-Mail Messaging.</b> When sending you e-mail we may use an image called a single pixel GIF, that allows us to format messages tailored to your computer's capabilities. We also use this technology to determine, in the aggregate, the number of people who open our e-mails. When you initiate a response by clicking on a link within an e-mail message, you are re-directed onto the internet. We then record your individual response to help us deliver information that is more relevant to your interests.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Intuit and its Subsidiaries</b> Intuit and its subsidiaries may exchange customer data with each other to fulfill your request or to provide you with information about other products and services.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Service Providers.</b> In some cases, we will employ or work with service providers such as consultants, temporary workers, third party software developers, or outsourcers to complete a business process or provide a service on our behalf. For example, we may use service providers to deliver products, offer online software applications, or send e-mails. When we employ service providers, we may need to share your personally identifiable information. Service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for purposes other than to act on our behalf.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Service Alerts and Critical Notices.</b> Although we respect and honor the privacy preferences you have expressed, we may nevertheless contact you to inform you of specific changes that may impact your ability to use this service or for other critical non-marketing purposes, such as bug alerts. We may also contact you to respond to your specific requests or to clarify the order information you provided to us.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Change of Control.</b> Your personally identifiable information may be transferred in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of Intuit and/or its subsidiaries. You will have the opportunity to opt out of further secondary use of your information following any change of control.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Changes to Our Privacy Policy.</b> If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we'll post those changes to the QuickBooks.com Web site 30 days before they take effect.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Legal Disclosures.</b> In some cases we may be required to disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request.</li>

<p>We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the site's servers from unauthorized access using industry standard computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully developed security procedures and practices. All employees must review and sign a written statement of these practices, which include limiting access to sensitive information to only those employees who require such information and enforcing strict password protocols for all employees. We use both internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.</p>

<p><b><a name="QBUpdate" class="Anchor">Automatic QuickBooks Product Update</a></b><br>
Intuit works year-round to make QuickBooks better. From time to time, we place updates on our Web site for customers to download. An update might include a timesaving new feature, minor repairs to keep software running smoothly, or timely information relevant to customers' businesses.</p>

<p>You can obtain these downloads in several different ways. The easiest is by using QuickBooks' Automatic Update feature. When an important update is available, QuickBooks uses the current Internet connection to download and install the update. Everything happens in the background, without disturbing current tasks or slowing down the computer. The software is updated while you work.</p>

<p>With the Automatic Update feature, QuickBooks only connects to Intuit servers when you are already connected to the Internet. You always have the option of turning off this feature. To do this, go to the "File" menu within QuickBooks, select "Update QuickBooks" then click the "Update Options" link and follow the instructions.</p>

<p>You may obtain the same updates by going to "Update QuickBooks" screen and clicking on "Update". You may also manually download program updates by visiting <a href="/support/updates.html">http://www.quickbooks.com/support/updates.html</a>.</p>

<p>The update feature transmits technical information to Intuit about the computer's connection and the QuickBooks software being updated. A secure connection protects customer-sensitive information during an update. Under no circumstances do Intuit servers access or read any other information on your computer. During an update, QuickBooks downloads only the necessary files to your PC.</p>

We gather information from you at various times during your usage of the product. Below we 
detail the point at which we take the information, what information we gather and how we 
use the information.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Startup Interview/Registration:</b> We collect your company contact 
information, which we use to contact you regarding the service. We may use 
your contact information to alert you regarding product changes, upgrades, 
and other special Intuit offers. To opt out simply indicate your preference 
at the time of registration, or contact us at 
<a href="http://privacy.intuit.com/">http://privacy.intuit.com</a>. We also 
collect information about your business, such as your industry, the number 
of employees you have, the type of ownership structure of your business, 
and outstanding loans your business may have. We use this information to 
customize the Chart of Accounts so that it accurately tracks the kind of 
activity your business will have, such as loan payments or tax filings. 
Lastly, we ask you to setup a Login Name, Password and Challenge Questions 
for use in logging in to QuickBooks Online Edition. Your password is encrypted 
on our servers, and no Intuit employee has access to it. QuickBooks Online 
Edition uses the <a href="https://login.quickbooks.com/">QuickBooks Business Services Login</a> 
process to simplify your access to this and our other services.</p>

<p><b>General Product Use:</b> No financial information you enter when using 
QuickBooks Online Edition will be used or shared except as required to 
fulfill a service you request.</p>

<p><b>Preferences:</b> In this section of the product your company name 
and contact information are stored and modifiable. This information is 
used in the communications and forms you generate in QuickBooks Online 
Edition, for example the statements and e-mails that you send to your 
customers.</p>

<p><b>Billing/Subscription:</b> We collect your credit card information, 
solely for the use of billing you for QuickBooks Online Edition.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, QuickBooks Online Edition uses its server logs to gather 
usage information. This allows us to better understand product performance, 
activity, and utilization. The information is used in the aggregate to 
improve the product.</p>

<p>QuickBooks Online Edition takes many precautions to safeguard your company 
information. You must access our product through a secure connection, 
protecting your information as it travels over the Internet. Also, our 
servers are backed up nightly, and those backups are stored remotely so 
that your information is safer in the event of a natural disaster.</p>

If you do not wish to receive notification of future product upgrades and be eligible for special offers, you may opt out during the information collection process or by contacting us at <a href="http://privacy.intuit.com/">http://privacy.intuit.com</a>.</p>

<p>We gather information from you at various times during your use of the QuickBooks Service Center. No financial information you enter when using QuickBooks Service Center will be shared except as required to fulfill a service you request. Below we detail the point at which we take the information, what information we gather and how we use the information:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Managing the Company:</b> This feature allows company administrators to update company and user information such as company name, login name, address, phone number, e-mail, as well as add or delete users and specify user rights. User login name and e-mail address are used to notify the user of changes in access or use rights. For example, when requesting access for a new user, you will be asked to provide the e-mail address of the new user. The e-mail address will be used to send an e-mail invitation to the new user with instructions on how to access the QuickBooks Service Center.</p>

<p><b>Subscription and Payment Information:</b> This feature allows you to view and update services that you currently subscribe to. It also allows you to set up payment methods for these services or services you may be interested in subscribing to. When you subscribe to a new service, your company name and e-mail address may be provided to the service you're requesting. Credit card information is used only to provide payment to the services you have subscribed to. We do not share your credit card information with third parties except as required to provide payment for the services you have subscribed to.</p>

<p><b><a name="MAS" class="Anchor">QuickBooks Merchant Account Service</a></b><br>
The QuickBooks Merchant Account Service allows you to accept payment by credit 
card from your customers by phone, mail, in-person, or online when used with 
QuickBooks Online Billing. To use this service your company must apply for a 
merchant account with one of our merchant bank partners. To apply for the 
Merchant Account Service, you will be required to supply the bank your company 
name, address, phone number, e-mail address, description of your products 
and/or services and detailed financial and operational information on your 
company. This information is used by the merchant bank for making a credit 
decision on your application. If they extend you credit, you become their 
customer and become subject to their privacy practices. Please see their privacy 
statements for further details on their practices.</p>

<p>If your application for an account is approved, information sufficient to 
uniquely identify your account is shared by our merchant bank partner with our 
Internet transaction processor partner, and then forwarded to Intuit. This 
information includes company name, address, phone and e-mail address. This 
information is used by the Internet transaction processor partner only for 
the purpose of fulfilling the transaction. On occasion, we may also use your 
contact information to send you special offers on Intuit products or services 
or those of our partners, which may be of interest to you. If you do not wish 
to receive such communications, simply indicate your contact preferences during 
the registration process or by contacting us at 
<a href="http://privacy.intuit.com/">http://privacy.intuit.com</a>.</p>

<p>QuickBooks Merchant Account Service allows you to process your customer 
payments directly from QuickBooks, so you do not have to re-enter transaction 
information. To enable this service, the transaction information you enter into 
the software is sent to an Intuit server and to the Internet transaction 
processor. Once confirmed, the transaction is updated in QuickBooks and your 
transaction information is sent to the merchant bank partner for settlement. 
For the security of your transactions and your convenience, the Internet 
transaction processor also keeps a record of the status of the transactions 
you've processed, so you can see reports of this information at any time 
through a Web browser. QuickBooks may use this information to track our 
partner's performance and to improve the design and functionality of this 
service.</p>

<p><b><a name="QBOB" class="Anchor">QuickBooks Online Billing</a></b><br>
The QuickBooks Online Billing service allows you to e-mail invoices, statements, 
and estimates from QuickBooks software and receive payment online from your 
customers. To use this service, we ask that you first sign in with QuickBooks 
Business Services. Currently, there are two methods of receiving payment that 
you can use with Online Billing: PayPal and QuickBooks Merchant Account Service 
(MAS). Please see the QuickBooks Merchant Account section of this statement for 
more details. For PayPal, both you and your customers must apply for an account 
with PayPal. The information collected during the PayPal registration process 
is governed by the 
<a href="http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/privacy-outside">PayPal privacy policy</a> 
and will be used to facilitate online payments. This information may also be used 
in the aggregate to help us evaluate our products and services.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you e-mail an invoice, statement, or estimate using either the basic or Deluxe Online 
Billing services, your e-mail is transmitted via a secure connection to Intuit for formatting prior to 
delivery to your customer. Form data (including items, quantities, terms, 
customer information, amounts, and the "from", "to", and "cc", 
and subject lines of the e-mail) may also be stored on Intuit's servers. In the case of 
forms enabled for online payment, storing this information allows us to create the Web 
site your customers will access to pay your invoices. In the case of forms not enabled 
for online payment, this information may be used for support purposes, such as 
confirming that an invoice has been sent. In addition, the invoice form may display 
a URL link designed to promote usage of Online Billing or other services supported 
by Intuit. We monitor your customers' interactions with these links, as well as with 
the Online Billing Web sites, to evaluate and improve our service. The information 
we collect about you or your customers' usage of the Online Billing service is used to help 
us evaluate and improve the Online Billing service for you and your customers.</p>

<p>Intuit also shares invoice and/or statement data with PayPal and/or QuickBooks 
MAS partners, as necessary to fulfill the service, for those customers who have 
elected to enable payment options. If you choose not to store information on 
Intuit servers (or if you do not wish to allow limited access of the invoice 
data to our payment partners as applicable), you will not be able to use the 
Online Billing service.</p>

<p>The Deluxe version of the Online Billing Service includes an E-mailed Forms 
Delivery Tracking feature that enables the invoice sender to determine if 
the recipient has viewed the e-mail invoice.  Viewing is tracked through 
the use of either a single pixel gif included in the e-mail or when a 
recipient clicks on a link to an online copy of the invoice.  Tracking 
information is only for use by the invoice sender.  Invoice recipients are 
notified of this feature through a separate e-mail message sent prior to the 
first use of this technology.  This information may also be used in the aggregate 
to help us evaluate this service.</p>

<p><b><a name="CreditCheck" class="Anchor">QuickBooks Credit Check Services</a></b><br>
The QuickBooks Credit Check Services allow you to get credit reports on your business customers right from QuickBooks. To use this service we ask that you first use the QuickBooks Business Services Login process to simplify your access to this and other services; then sign up for an account with Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B). To sign up for an account, you must supply your name, e-mail address, company name and address, billing address, phone number, and credit card information. This information is required to register your company to use the services. On occasion, we may contact you with special offers on products and services of Intuit or one of our partners, which we think may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive such communications, simply indicate your contact preferences during the registration process or by contacting us at <a href="http://privacy.intuit.com/">http://privacy.intuit.com</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Acquiring Credit Reports.</b> In order to get a credit report on a company you are researching, you must provide the name and state of that company. You may choose to supply additional information (such as address, phone number, and DUNS #) in order to increase the confidence level of the match. This information will be used for the sole purpose of locating the company in the D&amp;B database, so you can then receive a company credit report, ongoing updated credit rating meters, and ongoing credit alerts (when there is business or financial news which might affect the credit rating of that company).</p>

<p><b>Receiving Credit Alerts.</b> You may choose to provide a list of businesses to D&amp;B in order to receive ongoing credit alerts. When you add a company to your Credit Alerts List, that company's name, address and phone number will be sent to D&amp;B for the sole purpose of locating that company in the D&amp;B database, so that D&amp;B can send you alerts when there is business or financial news which might affect the credit rating of that company.</p>

<p><b>Report A/R Aging Information to D&amp;B.</b> You may choose to report A/R Aging Data to D&amp;B on your selected commercial customers. When you report information, you submit the names, addresses, and payment information (displayed on your screen for review prior to submission) to D&amp;B for the purpose of contributing to D&amp;B's picture of your customers' payment habits. The payment information you submit will be aggregated with payment information from other sources and used as an input to D&amp;B's credit/payment score calculations. D&amp;B will not disclose the source of payment information on a particular company (except when requested by that company's owner, and only when five or more vendors have submitted data, in which case the sources are identified alphabetically, preventing any match-up to the specific payment experiences). D&amp;B will not send marketing or other communications to your customers. When you submit your information to D&amp;B, the customer name, address and payment information is sent from your computer directly to D&amp;B.</p>
