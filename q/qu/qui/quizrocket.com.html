          QuizRocket does not endorse, nor is QuizRocket responsible
          for the accuracy of, the Privacy Policies and/or Terms and Conditions
          of each of the Advertisers on the QuizRocket Website. The
          entities which advertise and/or place banner ads on the

          affiliated with QuizRocket.
          </p>

          <p>
          QuizRocket delivers to your web browser many of the
          advertisements you see when you use the Website. However,
          QuizRocket also allows other companies, called third-party ad
          servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within and/or on the
          Website. Because your web browser must request these advertising
          banners from the ad networks' servers, these companies can send their
          own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web
          page from the Website. In addition, QuizRocket uses third-party
          service provider partners to employ anonymous cookies for accounting
          and data integrity purposes.
          </p>

          <p>
          If you want to prevent a third-party ad server and/or third-party
          service provider from sending and reading cookies on your computer,
          currently you must visit each ad network's and service provider's
          website individually and opt out (if they offer this capability).
          Note that disabling cookies may limit, or in some cases, preclude your
          use of this site.
          </p>
