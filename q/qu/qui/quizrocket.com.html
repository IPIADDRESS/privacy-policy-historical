<br>
<div class="center">Effective as of June 13, 2013</div>
<br>
<p>This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how personally identifiable information you voluntarily provide, authorize to be released, or which is publicly available may be obtained and used for purposes of marketing by Adknowledge EN, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its QuizRocket.com business operations ("QuizRocket").  QuizRocket is a technology business providing advertisements to consumers who have voluntarily registered with QuizRocket or one of its partners, through websites (owned and operated by QuizRocket or a third party), social networking applications and other means (together, these sources are referenced hereafter as "Publishers"). As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including Websites and related technologies and "offline" means methods other than online, including in person, via postal mail, telephone and similar means. This Policy does not apply to the practices of Publishers or other companies that QuizRocket does not own or control or to people that QuizRocket does not employ or manage.  QuizRocket retains its right to modify this policy from time to time by re-publishing it on the Internet; please check back for updates, as reflected in the Effective as of date above.  Further, QuizRocket retains its right to enter into new or different lines of business with consumers and if and to the extent it does so, may display a different Privacy Policy to the consumer for such lines of business.</p>

<p>1. <u>Collection of Information</u>.</p>

<p>1.1 <u>Subscription or Survey Information</u>. QuizRocket collects information from you when you voluntarily provide it to QuizRocket or one of its Publishers (for example, by signing up for an email newsletter or through a co-registration offer on a survey), or by others means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "User Form"). In a User Form, QuizRocket or a third party may offer you incentives in exchange for providing information about yourself such as name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers, birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, employment information, and personal and online interests (together, "User Information"). Completing the User Form is voluntary and you are under no obligation to provide User Information.</p>

<p>1.2 <u>Vendor List Information</u>. QuizRocket may obtain information about you after you provide information to a third party and you permit that party (the "Seller") to share the information, which QuizRocket subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise lawfully acquires. Such information may include, but is not limited to, your name, street address, zip code, telephone numbers, birth date, gender, salary range, education, marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and other information which you provided to the Seller (together, "Vendor List Information"). When acquiring Vendor List Information, QuizRocket requires assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Vendor List Information to QuizRocket and that QuizRocket may lawfully use the Vendor List Information to transmit offers from advertisers.</p>

<p>1.3 <u>User Behaviors Collected with Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information</u>. QuizRocket uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you, such as your Internet Protocol address and what Web browser you are using, with certain of your online behaviors, such as opening or clicking on a particular online advertisement. Additionally, QuizRocket may use other new and evolving sources of information and information gathering in the future (together, "Technology Information").</p>

<p>(a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of your computer that allows QuizRocket and/or its partners to identify your IP address with corresponding information in QuizRocket's database. QuizRocket and/or its partners may use cookies to track individual responses or views of advertisements, and use this information to help predict what other advertisements may be of interest to you  and enable you to receive customized advertisements or content. These cookies contain no personally identifiable information. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, such as your email address, that we may share with any third party, solely in hashed, non-human readable form. To learn about how you can opt-out of the receipt of cookies, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices.  To learn about how you can remove cookies placed on your computer or prevent the placement of cookies on your computer, please see Section 4 below.  To learn more about cookies in general, please visit http://www.cookiecentral.com.</p>

<p>(b) Web beacons. A web beacon is programming code used to display an image on a web page and can also transfer an individual's user identification to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about the individual. Web beacons enable QuizRocket to track certain Web sites you visit or advertisements you view online. Web beacons help determine products or services in which you may be interested and help track online behaviors for marketing purposes. More information about web beacons is available at http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_beacon.html.</p>

<p>(c) Where Technology Information is Collected. Technology Information is collected directly from QuizRocket advertisements or indirectly through Publishers that QuizRocket contracts with to display advertisements. Such advertisements will usually be displayed within one of the following advertising vehicles:</p>

<p><u>Websites</u>. QuizRocket may set a cookie on your computer when you view advertisements delivered on Publisher websites. After a cookie is set, QuizRocket may track how you interact with the advertisement and the Publisher website (for example, registering, purchasing, browsing, etc.).</p>

<p><u>Software Programs</u>. Similar to Websites, QuizRocket displays banner advertisements in software programs that you may use.</p>
<p><u>Email Databases</u>.QuizRocket and/or its partners may track your interaction with email advertisements sent to you (for example, by setting a cookie on your computer) on behalf of Publishers, advertisers or partner websites (for example, when you register, purchase, or browse in response to such email).</p>
<p><u>1.4 Outside Information</u>. QuizRocket may lawfully receive information about you from third parties, such as information located in public databases ("Outside Information").</p>
<p><u>1.5 No Information Collected from Minors</u>. MINORS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 SHOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS, TO QUIZROCKET.

<p><u>2.2 Targeted Advertising and Information</u>. QuizRocket uses Individual Information to target advertising and other information, such as business, weather, entertainment, sports and general news alerts and similar information, more effectively. When an individual is online, QuizRocket uses Technology Information to associate an individual with their Individual Information and QuizRocket attempts to show information and advertising for products and services to which the person may respond.

For example, QuizRocket may notice that you responded to a baseball banner advertisement and use that response to deliver a baseball-related advertisement and other information to you.</p>
<p><u>2.3 Legal Process</u>. QuizRocket may disclose Individual Information to respond to subpoenas, court orders and other legal process as required by law.</p>
