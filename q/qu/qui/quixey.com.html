    </p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span>We collect information from you in various ways when you use our Site and Services. We may also supplement this information with information from other companies. The following are the specific types of information you give to us:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5">Information You Decide to Provide</span><span>: &nbsp;If you decide to contact us through the Site or send us feedback through our Services, we may collect your name, company name, email address and telephone number and other Personal Information that you submit to us. Similarly, if you desire to have access to certain sections of the Site, you may be required to become a registered user and to submit certain Personal Information to us to allow you to use certain features of the Site. &nbsp;Additionally, if you create an account on either the Site or any Service, you may be asked for your name, email address, telephone number or other Personal Information.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5">Information Collected Through Your Use of the Services</span><span>: When you use our Services, including the Quixey Apps and Quixey Platform, we automatically collect specific information such as the Services and applications that you use, how you use them, and information about the device you are using them from. </span><span>This information includes:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span>
    </p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_bup8i6ub1zld-0 start">
        <li class="c0 c2"><span class="c5">Log Files</span><span>: When you use our Site or Services, our servers automatically receive and record certain information from your browser and computer or device, such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring/exit pages and URLs, API calls and parameters, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, and pages viewed.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c0 c2"><span class="c5">Use Information</span><span>: Our servers automatically receive and record information about how you use our Services, such as your search queries, how you interact with the search results or deep view cards, and which features of our Services you use and how you use them.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c0 c2"><span class="c5">Device Information</span><span>: Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically collect device-specific information such as a device identifier, device model, user settings, the operating system and version, device type and manufacturer, wireless carrier or operator, and network type, as well as other information about your use of our Services.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c0 c2"><span class="c5">Application Information</span><span>: We also index and collect information about the mobile apps that you have installed or access on your mobile device, such as app names, app identifiers, installations/uninstallations, and launch history (including, for example, number of times apps were launched, the location you were at and the time when they were launched, and whether the launch occurred as a result of interacting with the Services).</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c0 c2"><span class="c5">Location information</span><span>: We may also collect and process information about your actual location, such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use sensor data from your device that provides information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers. &nbsp;</span><span>You may change this default behavior in the device settings.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c0 c2"><span class="c5">Email Address</span><span>: When you use our Services on a mobile device, we collect your email address and anonymize it through one-way hashing. &nbsp;If, while using a Quixey App, you choose to create a profile as described below, your email address will no longer be anonymous.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c0 c2"><span class="c5">Third Party Account Information</span><span>: &nbsp;Some portions of the Services may enable you to search your personal content on third-party sites. If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted to us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. For example, if you provide us account information about your Facebook account, our Services will be able to access your basic information on Facebook.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c0 c2"><span class="c5">Cookies, Anonymous Identifiers and Beacons</span><span>: Quixey uses cookies (small data files) and other anonymous identifiers (e.g., a random string of characters that is used for the same purposes as a cookie on platforms where cookie technology is not available to uniquely identify your browser) to enable session and state management. We may send one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to improve your use of our Site and Services. &nbsp;A cookie may convey anonymous information about how you use our Services, but does not collect Personal Information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your device after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent uses of our Services. &nbsp;Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. &nbsp;You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent, however, some features of our Services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. &nbsp;We may also use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. &nbsp;No personally identifiable information is collected using these clear GIFs. &nbsp;In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. This information is used to enable more accurate reporting and make our Services better for our users. &nbsp;Our analytics providers use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the website, tracking users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Additionally, Quixey Apps may automatically collect the following information:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_bup8i6ub1zld-0">
        <li class="c0 c2"><span class="c5">Profile</span><span>: When you use Launch by Quixey, if you create a profile, we collect and store your email address and the name you provide and associate them with your preferences so that you can quickly recreate those preferences on another device. If you delete the profile, email address and all profile information will be deleted.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c0 c2"><span class="c5">Location information</span><span>: We currently require location information in order to provide Launch by Quixey, so if you do not consent to this collection, you cannot use Launch. &nbsp;We collect and process information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by your mobile device). We may also use sensor data from your device that provides information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers. &nbsp;If you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop it at any time by changing the preferences in your mobile device settings, however, if you do so, Launch will no longer function properly. </span>
        </li>
        <li class="c0 c2"><span class="c5">Personal Search</span><span>: Launch by Quixey and other Quixey Apps enable you to extend your search for relevant application functionality to content on your device (“Personal Search”). If you install a Service that performs Personal Search, we will provide search results based on your browser history, contacts, calendar, texts, photos, videos, music and other content on your device (“Personal Search Data”) but will not collect Personal Search Data. For some Services, you may change this behavior in the settings.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c0 c2"><span class="c5">Call Logs</span><span>: Launch by Quixey learns your communication patterns to surface those contacts you are most likely to call at a given time or location. To make these recommendations, </span><span>Quixey accesses and collects in- and out-bound call log information</span><span>, such as the phone number, caller name and time of the call. &nbsp;Note that Launch also uses location information to make these recommendations.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c0 c2"><span class="c5">Device Metadata</span><span>: &nbsp;Launch by Quixey also learns your device usage patterns to surface those apps and contacts you are most likely to want at given time, location or what your device is connected to. &nbsp;To make these recommendations, Quixey collects device metadata such as location of use, connected devices, WiFi connections (including WiFi MAC ID), and user activity (such as walking, running, cycling, driving).</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5">How</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;We Use the Information We Collect</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span>All Quixey Services use the information we collect to personalize the Services for you, including providing results that may be relevant based upon your location or your use of applications or features on your device. &nbsp;If you have installed Launch by Quixey, we use the information we collect to predictively surface relevant functionality throughout the day. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span>We also use this information to suggest new applications that may interest you. We also use the information to provide, maintain, protect and improve the Services; to develop new services; to analyze how you use the Services; to protect our servers and users; and to offer you personalized content. For example, we may use the information we collect:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span>
    </p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_r48lwe1kclwe-0 start">

    <p class="c0"><span>In addition, if you decide to provide Personal Information about yourself via the Site or if you provide Personal Information by setting up a profile on a mobile device, we may use your email address to send you Service-related notices (including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail). We may also use your Personal Information to send you marketing messages. If you do not want to receive such messages, you may opt out by following the instructions in the message.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span>We also may aggregate your data with other users’ data in non-personally identifiable, aggregated and anonymized form to analyze and improve the Services. Aggregate data is information we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, no Personal Information is included in aggregate data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our services. This Privacy Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate data, and, as explained in further detail below, we may share aggregate data about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand our users’ needs, improve our services and for advertising and marketing purposes.</span>
