						You are identified on quicksales by your User ID, other people can see items you are bidding on, have won or purchased in the past, have sold 
						in the past, items you are currently selling, your ratings and comments received from other users and ratings and comments you have left

						(name, address and phone numbers).</p>
						<p>Legal Requests<br>
						quicksales will disclose any  information about you only when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our User 
						Agreement; or protect intellectual property and other rights, property, or safety of quicksales, our users, or others. 
						quicksales cooperates with law enforcement and government officials and  other third parties and we can (and you authorise us to) disclose any 
						information about you as we, in our sole discretion, believe appropriate to assist with investigations into fraud, intellectual property 
						infringements, privacy or any other  illegal activity or activity that may expose quicksales to legal liability. </p>
						<p>Although quicksales adheres to industry standard practices to ensure your personal information is protected, due to technical limitations, 
						we cannot and do not guarantee that your personal information will remain private as third parties may unlawfully intercept or access 
						private communications and transmissions. </p>
						
						<p><strong>4. Emailing tools </strong></p>
						<p>quicksales provides facilities throughout the site to refer a friend to quicksales or to send references to a specific listing to a friend. 
						You may not use the "Email to a friend" service or other email forwarding services that we offer to send spam or otherwise 
						send content that would violate our User Agreement or Privacy Policy. We do not permanently store, sell, or rent these email messages 
						or the email addresses.</p>

						address and phone number, etc. You must ensure your personal information is kept up to date and is accurate. quicksales will store your 
						previous personal information to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, assist with any investigations and enforce our User Agreement and 
						legal requirements. </p>
						<p>Upon your request we will deactivate your account, however your personal information is not removed from our databases due to technical 
						constraints. Therefore you should not expect that your personal information is removed. To close your account, please go to: 
						http://www.quicksales.com.au/secure/User/cancelmembership.aspx</p>

						actions taken with this information and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy.</p>

						Cookies are widely used on most major Web sites.</p>
						<p>quicksales mostly uses "session" cookies, which are removed from your computer once you leave quicksales. However, quicksales also uses 
						persistent cookies to personalise the user experience, to help protect our members and to provide us with research information 
						(such as how often members visit quicksales each month). Persistent cookies allow us to track users on quicksales and help us identify users abusing 
						the quicksales service.</p>

						you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address.</p>
						
						<p><strong>10. Advertising and third party links </strong></p>
						<p>Some quicksales advertisers may request information directly from users, or link to sites that do so. quicksales has no control over its 
						advertisers' privacy policies, and encourages users to review such policies prior to submitting any personal information to them.</p>
						<p>quicksales contains non-advertising links to a variety of third party sites to enhance the member experience. quicksales has no control of 
						either the content or privacy policies of such sites, nor should such links be considered an endorsement of these sites except where 
						otherwise noted.</p>
