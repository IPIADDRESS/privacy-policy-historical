<h1>
	Privacy</h1>
<h2>
	Introduction</h2>
<p>
	This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains in general terms how Flight Centre Limited ACN 003 377 188 and its various brands, including but not limited to Flight Centre, Quickbeds.com, Escape Travel, Student Flights, Travel Associates and Cruiseabout (collectively referred to in this document as "quickbeds.com", "Flight Centre", "we" "our" or "us") protects the privacy of your personal information. We are firmly committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information and maintain robust physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect personal information in our care.</p>
<h2>
	What is personal information?</h2>
<p>
	Personal information is information or an opinion, in any form (whether true or not) about an individual whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained from the information or opinion.</p>
<h2>
	How do we collect personal information?</h2>
<p>
	Where practical we will collect personal information directly from you. Generally this will be collected by us when you deal with us either in person, by telephone, letter, facsimile, email or when you visit our website. We may request information about you when you purchase or make enquires about tickets or other products and services; when you enter competitions, register for promotions or when you request brochures or other information. We may also collect information when we invite you to complete surveys or provide us with feedback.&nbsp; If you choose to follow Quickbeds on the Facebook or Twitter social media sites or to post comments on the Quickbeds News Blog, we may also collect personal information you provide (further detail on this is provided below at “Social media and Blog”).</p>
<h2>
	What personal information do we collect?</h2>
<p>
	Generally, the type of personal information we collect about you is the information that is needed to facilitate your travel arrangements and bookings and to provide travel services and products to you. For example, we may collect details such as your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, credit card number and expiry date, passport details, dietary requirements (if any) and health issues relevant to your travel arrangements. We also collect information that is required for use in the business activities of Flight Centre, including for example, financial details necessary in order to process various transactions and any other information you may elect to provide to us.</p>
<p>
	We are required by law to obtain your consent to the collection of sensitive information. We will assume that you have consented to the collection of all information which is provided to us for use in accordance with this Policy, unless you tell us otherwise.</p>
<h2>
	When we act as agent</h2>
<p>
	When we sell products and services to you, we usually do so as agent for the wholesaler or provider of those products and services. This means that we usually collect personal information about you, both for our internal purposes, and on behalf of the parties for whom we act as agent, for their internal purposes. Accordingly, the consent you provide under this statement to the collection of personal information by us, applies equally to the parties whose products and services we sell. For example, if you purchase a Qantas flight from us, then under this policy you will have consented to your personal information being used by us, being provided to Qantas to enable your flight to be booked and being used by Qantas for Qantas’ purposes.</p>
<p>
	We act as agent for many hundreds of companies, so it is not possible for us to set out in this statement exactly how each of these companies will use your personal information, but we are happy to provide more specific information to you if you email your query to us at <a href="mailto:customer.feedback@flightcentre.com">customer</a><a href="mailto:customerservice@quickbeds.com?subject=Enquiry%20RE%20Privacy%20Statement">service@quickbeds.com</a></p>

<p>
	Other than the above, we will not disclose your personal information which is accessible on the Facebook or Twitter social media sites or the Quickbeds News Blog without your consent unless disclosure is either necessary to prevent a threat to life or health, authorised or required by law, reasonably necessary to enforce the law or necessary to investigate a suspected unlawful activity.</p>
