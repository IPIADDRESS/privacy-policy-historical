<p>At Intuit, we dedicate ourselves to revolutionizing the way individuals manage their financial lives and small businesses manage their business. In that effort, we respect and protect the privacy of those who visit or use our Web sites. When we collect information from you, we want you to know how it is used. To demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices, we have adopted leading industry privacy guidelines. Intuit is a Premier Sponsor of TRUSTe and a member of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.</p>
<p>This privacy statement defines privacy aspects specific to the Quicken.com Web site and affiliated Intuit Web servers (also referred to as the "Quicken Web site"). It serves as an adjunct to the <a href="http://privacy.intuit.com/policies/">Intuit Online Privacy Policy</a>, which represents our general privacy philosophy and governs all of our Web sites. The Quicken Web site's privacy practices are consistent and compliant with that policy.</p>
<p>Federal legislation requires us to provide Quicken.com users who register for tools, planners and personalized services with a description of our information collection and sharing practices. To view the notice, please <a href="/support/privacy/GLB/">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Because of the financial nature of our business, our Web sites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. Therefore, we do not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children.</p>
<span class="fRC">Our Philosophy and Practices</span>
<p>At Intuit, we want you to feel comfortable and confident when using our Web sites. Therefore, we'd like to share with you the following principles that govern our information practices and other privacy aspects of all our Web sites:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><a href="#notice">We provide you notice of our Web site information practices.</a>
</li><li><a href="#how">We tell you how and why we use Web technologies.</a>
</li><li><a href="#choice">We give you choices about how the personally identifiable information that you provide us may be used.</a>
</li><li><a href="#access">We let you update or correct your personally identifiable information.</a>
</li><li><a href="#security">We work to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration.</a>

</li></ul>
<span class="fRC"><a name="notice">We provide you notice of our web site information practices.</a></span>
<p>To maximize the value of our services, we may request information from you when you visit the Quicken Web site. When we collect information from you, we'll tell you what is collected, how it is collected, by whom it is collected, why it is collected and to whom it may be disclosed.</p>
<p>Here is how and why we collect and use information from you:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Registration for Tools, Planners and Personalized Services.</b> We provide a number of tools, planners and other interactive advisors to help you manage your financial life, some of which require registration. When you register, you select a member name by which we will know you, choose a password and provide us an e-mail address and ZIP code (optional). By registering, you can:
<br><br>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Save your financial and account information such as investment portfolios and financial accounts for later review and update
</li><li>Download your banking, investment and credit card statements
</li><li>Create a personalized finance page. </li></ul>
<p>You use your member name and password to gain access to your portfolio and account information. We use the e-mail address that you provide to contact you if you choose to receive e-mail alerts or other communications from us. We may use your ZIP code to provide more personalized content and promotions. Some of our financial planners require more specific demographic information such as age or gender in order to calculate life expectancy.</p>
<p>Occasionally we may also use your e-mail address to offer you the opportunity to provide us input via surveys that will help us improve our services.</p>
<p>For access to banking, investment, and credit card statement download services, we ask you to provide additional information. We use this information to verify your accounts with your financial institutions and to provide you access to the services you are requesting. Additional information required may include name, social security number, account number, mother's maiden name and personal identification number (PIN). We do not share this information with third parties except as required to fulfill the services you have requested.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Calculators.</b> We provide a wide range of tax, home ownership, insurance and other calculators to help you make the best financial decisions for you and your family. The financial information you provide when using these tools is used strictly to perform the calculations requested as you try various "what if" scenarios. We do not collect this information nor link it to any personally identifiable information. Once you close the tool, none of the information used in these calculations is saved. </li><li><b>Quicken Bill Manager.</b> Quicken Bill Manager is a Web-based service that allows you to view and pay your bills on the Internet. In addition to offering this service independently, Quicken co-brands view payment and presentment services with select partners such as AOL. The personally identifiable information you provide: name, address, phone number, e-mail address, social security number, date of birth and mother's maiden name will be used to verify your identity and to contact you regarding the service. In some cases, we may contact you regarding additional services we think may be of interest to you.

We also ask for your credit card number to process your initial and all subsequent payments. The contact information is required to establish your quote service with the exchanges of your choice. Your e-mail address will be used as our primary source of contact with you regarding your service. We do not share this information with third parties except as required to fulfill your request for service.
</li><li><b>Quicken Mobile.</b> Quicken Mobile allows you to access certain features of Quicken.com from your wireless device.

<span class="fRC">More on our general information practices.</span>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Mandatory and Optional Information.</b> We identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request. Whenever we ask for additional or optional information, we identify those fields appropriately so that you know what is required to provide the requested service. If you choose not to provide mandatory information, we will not be able to provide the service you are requesting.</li>
<li><b>Intuit and its Subsidiaries.</b> Intuit and its subsidiaries may exchange customer information with each other to fulfill your requests or to provide you with information about other products or services. </li>
<li><b>Intuit Partners and Co-branded or Third-Party Sites.</b> Some of the products and services offered on this Web site are provided by Intuit's business partners. To fulfill your request for such services, we will forward your customer information to a partner, as necessary. When offering partner services on an Intuit or a co-branded site, the partner who will be receiving your information will be clearly identified. The Quicken Web site may provide links to third-party Web sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. On these sites either Intuit or its partners may collect information about you. Intuit is not responsible for the actions of these third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personally identifiable information.</li>
<li><b>E-mail Message Formatting.</b> When sending you e-mail we may use a small graphical image called a single-pixel GIF that allows us to (1) format messages that best align with your computer's capabilities and (2) determine whether you've opened a graphically formatted (HTML) e-mail. When you click on a link within an e-mail message, such as Quicken.com newsletter, you will first pass through our server, then you are redirected onto the Internet. We use this click-through data on an aggregate level to evaluate response rates to our e-mail messages and to determine which links are most useful to our customers.
</li>
<li><b>Service Providers.</b> In some cases, we will employ or work with service providers such as consultants, temporary workers, third party software developers or outsourcers to complete a business process or provide a service on our behalf. For example, we may use service providers to deliver products, offer online software applications or send e-mails. When we employ service providers, we may need to share your personally identifiable information. Service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for purposes other than to act on our behalf.</li>
<li><b>Service Alerts and Critical Notices.</b> Although we respect and honor the privacy preferences you have expressed, we may nevertheless contact you to inform you of specific changes that may impact your ability to use this service or for other critical non-marketing purposes, such as bug alerts. We may also contact you to respond to your specific requests or to clarify the order information you provided to us.</li> <li><b>Change of Control.</b> Your personally identifiable information may be transferred in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of Intuit and/or its subsidiaries. You will have the opportunity to opt out of further secondary use of your information following any change of control.</li>
<li><b>Changes to Our Privacy Policies.</b> If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we'll post those changes to this privacy statement 30 days before they take effect.</li>
<li><b>Legal Disclosure.</b> In some cases we may disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request.</li>
</ul>
<span class="fRC"><a name="how">We tell you how and why we use Web technologies.</a></span>
<p>Here is how and why we use some common Web technologies to help manage our Web sites:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Cookies.</b> A "cookie" is a small piece of information that our Web sites may provide to your browser while you are at our sites. The Quicken Web site supplies your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas). These cookies are not linked to the personally identifiable information that you provide us elsewhere on the site. If you are a registered user on the Quicken Web site, you will receive an additional cookie when you login. This cookie is maintained by your browser and contains your identifier. This cookie is also used to authenticate your identity and provide you with access to areas of our Web site that are limited to registered users, such as those that allow you to view and manage your portfolio or accounts.
You do not have to accept cookies from our site. Only the areas that require registration require cookies. Should you decide that you would like to register and login to special areas of the Web site and you have modified your browser settings not to accept cookies, you will need to re-set your browser to accept the cookies that we send it. Otherwise, we will not be able to let you participate in certain areas of the Web site. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies. <p>
Advertising networks that serve ads on this Web site may assign different cookies to you. Those cookies may be used to track your involvement with the advertising on our site. Additionally, third party ad servers use cookies and small graphical images called single-pixel GIFs on behalf of Quicken.com to track the effectiveness of Quicken.com advertising on other Web sites. Third-party ad servers report data in the aggregate and do not link it to any personally identifiable information. You may choose not to accept cookies from third-party ad servers. Intuit does not control those parties. You should review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why, and how they collect and use private information. If you would like to know more about this practice and your choices about not having this information used by advertising networks, please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/naiprivacy">click here</a>. </p><p>
</p></li><li><b>Web Site Usage Data.</b> With or without cookies, our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL. We use this data in the aggregate to better understand Web site usage, including what areas of our Web site users prefer. This information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting. This log information is not linked to personally identifiable information gathered elsewhere on the site.
</li></ul>
<span class="fRC"><a name="choice">We give you choices about how the personally identifiable information that you provide to us may be used.</a></span>
<p>We give you the opportunity to control the use of the personally identifiable information that you provide us for purposes other than to fulfill your request. We will provide you the opportunity to opt-out of secondary uses of personally identifiable information you provide us, whenever we gather it. Simply notify us during the information collection process or contact us at <a href="http://privacy.intuit.com">http://privacy.intuit.com</a>.</p>
<span class="fRC"><a name="access">We let you update or correct your personally identifiable information.</a></span>
<p>At our Web site, we provide you the opportunity to update or correct your contact, account, and portfolio information, as well as banking, investing and credit card statement download information. You may review and update your bill payment and viewing services information by phoning Quicken Bill Manager Customer Support.</p>
<span class="fRC"><a name="security">We work to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration.</a></span>
<p>We employ industry recognized security safeguards to help protect the personally identifiable information you provide us from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration. Whenever we prompt you to transmit sensitive information, such as a credit card number, to us through our Web site, we support the encrypted transmission of that data.</p>
<p>We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on our sites' servers from unauthorized access using industry standard computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully developed security procedures and practices. All Intuit employees must review and sign a written statement with these practices, which include limiting access to sensitive information to only those employees who require the information and enforcing strict password protocols for all employees. In addition, a username and password are required for you to use, view or change application or interview information. We use both internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.</p>
<span class="fRC"><a name="contact">We provide various ways for you to contact us about our information practices and other aspects of privacy.</a></span>
<p>Questions regarding the Quicken Web site's privacy statement, our online privacy policy, our information practices or other aspects of privacy on our Web site should be directed to us at <a href="http://privacy.intuit.com">http://privacy.intuit.com</a>.</p>
