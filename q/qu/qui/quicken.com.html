<p>At Intuit, we dedicate ourselves to revolutionizing the way individuals
manage their financial lives and small businesses manage their business. In
that effort, we respect and protect the privacy of those who visit or use our
Web sites. When we collect information from you, we want you to know how it is
used. To demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices, we have
adopted leading industry privacy guidelines. Intuit is a Premier Sponsor of
TRUSTe and a member of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.</p>

<p>This privacy statement defines privacy aspects specific to the Quicken.com
Web site and affiliated Intuit Web servers (referred to as the "Quicken
Web sites"). It serves as an adjunct to the <a href="http://privacy.intuit.com/policies/">Intuit Online Privacy Policy</a>,
which represents our general privacy philosophy and governs all of our Web
sites. The Quicken Web sites' privacy practices are consistent and compliant
with that policy.</p>

<p>Federal law requires us to provide Quicken.com users who register
for tools, planners and personalized services with a description of our
information collection and sharing practices. To view the notice, please <a href="/support/privacy/GLB/">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Because of the financial nature of our business, our Web sites are not
designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. Therefore, we do not
knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children.</p>

<span class="fRC">Our Philosophy and Practices</span>

<p>At Intuit, we want you to feel comfortable and confident when using our Web
site. Therefore, we’d like to share with you the following principles that
govern our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web sites:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><a href="#notice">We provide you notice of our Web site information practices.</a>
</li><li><a href="#how">We tell you how and why we use Web technologies.</a>
</li><li><a href="#choice">We give you choices about how the personally identifiable information that you provide to us may be used.</a>
</li><li><a href="#access">We let you update or correct your personally identifiable information.</a>
</li><li><a href="#security">We work to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration.</a>
</li><li><a href="#contact">We provide various ways for you to contact us about our information practices and other aspects of privacy.</a>
</li></ul>
<span class="fRC"><a name="notice">We provide you notice of our web site
information practices.</a></span>

<p>To maximize the value of our
services, we may request information from you when you visit our Web sites. Unless you ask us to, <b>Intuit does not share your personal information with outside companies for their promotional use.</b> 
When we collect information from you, we'll tell you what is collected, by whom it is collected, to whom it may be disclosed, and how it will
be used.</p>

<p>Here is how and why we collect and use information from you:</p>
<ul type="disc">

<a name="tools"></a><li><a name="tools"><b>Registration for Tools, Planners and Personalized Services.</b> We provide a number of tools,
planners and other interactive advisors to help you manage your financial life,
some of which require registration. When you register, you select a member name
by which we will know you, choose a password and provide us an e-mail address
and ZIP code (optional). By registering, you can:
    <ul type="disc">
    <li>Save
your financial and account information such as investment portfolios and
financial accounts for later review and update
    </li><li>Download your banking, investment and credit card statements
    </li><li>Create a personalized finance page
  </li></ul>
<p>You use your member name and password to gain
access to your portfolio and account information. We use the e-mail address
that you provide to contact you if you choose to receive e-mail alerts or other
communications from us. Some of our financial
planners require more specific demographic information such as age or gender in
order to calculate life expectancy.</p>

</a><a name="process"></a><p>Intuit does not share your contact information with
outside companies for their promotional use.  If you are a registered user, we
may use your e-mail address to notify you about new Quicken.com services or
special offers available to registered users or about other Intuit products or
those of our partners.  If you would prefer not to receive this information,
simply indicate your contact preferences during the registration process or
<a href="http://www.quicken.com/quicken/go?dest=webq.reg.optout.email">click here</a>. </p>

<p>For access to banking, investment, and credit card
statement download services, we ask you to provide additional information. We
use this information to verify your accounts with your financial institutions
and to provide you access to the services you are requesting. Additional
information required may include name, social security number, account number,
mother's maiden name and personal identification number (PIN). We do not share
this information with third parties except as required to fulfill the services
you have requested.</p>

</li><li><b>Calculators.</b> We provide a wide range of tax,
home ownership, insurance and other calculators to help you make the best
financial decisions for you and your family. The financial information you
provide when using these tools is used strictly to perform the calculations
requested as you try various "what if" scenarios. We do not collect
this information nor link it to any personally identifiable information. Once
you close the tool, none of the information used in these calculations is saved.

</li><li><b>Newsletters.</b> We provide you the opportunity to
subscribe to e-mail newsletters and other e-mail communications. You may
unsubscribe at the subscription center or by following the instructions
provided in each e-mail newsletter.

</li><li><b>Customer Service/Support.</b> In
order to provide you with customer service, we ask for your name and e-mail
address. We may use your contact information in order to contact you regarding
service updates or specific support questions and may contact you for
additional opportunities to provide feedback on our products and services.
Providing your name is optional.

</li><li><b>Contests, Sweepstakes, and Surveys.</b> From time to time, we may offer you the option to participate in
contests, sweepstakes, or surveys. If you would like to participate, we may ask
you for contact information, preferences, or other information. This
information may be used to conduct research, improve our offerings, or award
prizes. Our contests and sweepstakes may have separate rules and we will
identify how the information that you supply will be used in each case. 

</li><li><b>TurboTax for the Web.</b> TurboTax for the Web is an Intuit-owned and operated service that
assists you in preparing and filing your taxes via the Internet. Privacy
practices specific to TurboTax for the Web are discussed in a separate
privacy statement located at <a href="http://www.turbotax.com/privacy/index.html">http://www.turbotax.com/privacy/index.html</a>.

</li><li><b>Quicken Insurance.</b>
Insurance services are provided by InsWeb Corporation of Sacramento, CA. Any
personally identifiable information such as: name, address, e-mail, or
insurance information that you provide will not be shared with Intuit. Intuit
is not responsible for the privacy practices of InsWeb. We encourage you to
review the InsWeb privacy policy at <a href="http://www.insweb.com/privacy.shtml">http://www.insweb.com/privacy.shtml</a>.

</li><li><b><a name="qloan">Mortgage/Quicken Loans.</a></b><a name="qloan"> 
Assistance with home loans is provided by Quicken Loans, Inc., an independent
company that is not controlled by Intuit.  Information you provide to Quicken
Loans is provided to Quicken Loans only, and not to Intuit.  Quicken Loans

</a><a href="http://quickenloans.quicken.com/jump/help/security.asp">Quicken Loans</a>. 
</li></ul>
<span class="fRC">More on our general information practices.</span>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Mandatory and Optional Information.</b> We identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request.
Whenever we ask for additional or optional information, we identify those
fields appropriately so that you know what is required to provide the requested
service. If you choose not to provide mandatory information, we will not be
able to provide the service you are requesting.
    </li><li><b>Intuit and its Subsidiaries.</b>  Intuit and its subsidiaries may exchange
customer information with each other to fulfill your requests or to provide you
with information about other products or services. 

</li><li><b><a name="email">E-mail Messaging.</a></b><a name="email"> 
When sending you e-mail we may use an image called a single pixel GIF, that
allows us to format messages tailored to your computer's capabilities. We also
use this technology to determine, in the aggregate, the number of people who
open our e-mails. When you initiate a response by clicking on a link within an
e-mail message, you are re-directed onto the Internet. We then record your
individual 
response to help us deliver information that is more relevant to your
interests.

</a></li><li><a name="email"><b>Framing.</b> In order to provide a seamless Web experience, we may occasionally 
display third party Web sites within the Quicken.com header. Though the URL in the browser 
may indicate you are at Quicken.com, you may be on a partner’s site.  You can always 
determine which site you are on by right clicking on a particular area of the site and then 
selecting "properties". When you are on a framed site, you may click “remove frame” to leave 
Quicken.com and go directly to the framed Web site. These third party Web sites are independent 
from Intuit and manage user information and data in accordance with their own privacy policies. 
Intuit is not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties.

</a></li><li><a name="email"><b>Service Providers.</b> In some
cases, we will employ or work with service providers such as consultants,
temporary workers, third party software developers or outsourcers to complete a
business process or provide a service on our behalf. For example, we may use
service providers to deliver products, offer online software applications or
send e-mails. When we employ service providers, we may need to share your
personally identifiable information. Service providers are strictly prohibited
from using your personally identifiable information for purposes other than to
act on our behalf.
</a></li><li><a name="email"><b>Service Alerts and Critical Notices.</b> Although we respect
and honor the privacy preferences you have expressed, we may nevertheless
contact you to inform you of specific changes that may impact your ability to
use this service or for other critical non-marketing purposes, such as bug
alerts.  We may also contact you to respond
to your specific requests or to clarify the order information you provided to
us.
    </a></li><li><a name="email"><b>Changes to Our Privacy Policies.</b> If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies
or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information,
we'll post those changes to this privacy statement 30 days before they take
effect.

</a></li><li><a name="email"><b>Change of Control.</b> Your personally identifiable information may be transferred in
connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition
(whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of
Intuit and/or its subsidiaries. You will have the opportunity to opt out of
further secondary use of your information following any change of control.

</a></li><li><a name="email"><b>Legal Disclosure.</b> In some
cases we may to disclose certain information to comply with a legal process,
such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request. 

</a></li><li><a name="email"><b>P3P Standard.</b> The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P),
developed by the World Wide Web Consortium, is emerging as an industry
standard providing a simple, automated way for users to gain more control over
the use of personal information on Web sites they visit. For more information
on P3P go to </a><a href="http://www.w3.org/P3P/">www.w3.org/P3P</a>.  
Intuit has enabled certain areas of our
Quicken.com Web site to comply with the P3P standard.  Within the inherent
constraints of any machine-readable system, we have attempted to reflect
certain of our privacy practices in the 'machine-readable' P3P format.
However, the "human readable" privacy statement you are currently reading is
the controlling document to which you should refer for questions regarding
Quicken.com's privacy statement.

</li></ul>
<span class="fRC"><a name="how">We tell you how and why we use Web
technologies.</a></span>
<p>Here is how and why we use some common Web
technologies to help manage our Web sites:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Cookies.</b>
A "cookie" is a small piece of information that our Web sites may
provide to your browser while you are at our sites. The Quicken Web sites
supply your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to
better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of
our sites users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas).
This cookie is not linked to the personally identifiable
information that you provide us elsewhere on the site. If you are a registered
user on the Quicken Web sites, you will receive an additional cookie when you
login. This cookie is maintained by your browser and contains your identifier.
This cookie is also used to authenticate your identity and provide you with
access to areas of our Web site that are limited to registered users, such as
those that allow you to view and manage your portfolio or accounts. You do not
have to accept cookies from our site. Only the areas that require registration
require cookies. Should you decide that you would like to register and login to
special areas of the Web site and you have modified your browser settings not
to accept cookies, you will need to re-set your browser to accept the cookies
that we send it. Otherwise, we will not be able to let you participate in
certain areas of the Web sites. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and
maintain cookies.<p></p>

<p>
Third parties that serve ads or content, such as news content, on this
website as well as Intuit's own ad servers may assign different cookies to you. Intuit's ad servers may serve ads on Intuit's and other companies' web sites.
Data collected by these cookies is anonymous and is not linked to personally
identifiable information.  These cookies may be used to
track your involvement with the advertising on our site. This involvement may
include limiting the ads you may see, as well as selecting ads that may be
more relevant to you.  Additionally, third-party ad servers and Intuit 
use cookies and small graphical images called single-pixel
GIFs on behalf of Quicken.com to track the effectiveness of Quicken.com
advertising on this and other Web sites. Third-party ad servers collect and 
report data in the
aggregate and do not link it to any personally identifiable information. You may choose not to accept cookies from third-party
ad servers.  Intuit does not control
those parties. You should review their privacy policies to learn more about
what, why, and how they collect and use private information. If you would like to know more about this
practice and your choices about not having this information used by 
third-party ad servers, please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">click here</a>.
</p><p>
<a name="usage"></a></p></li><li><a name="usage"><b>Web Site Usage Data.</b></a>
Our Web site tracks usage data, for example, your IP address or domain name,
browser type and version, which pages you view, which page, if any, linked you
to our site and which link, if any, you follow off of our site. We use this
data in the aggregate to better understand Web site activity and to improve our
site offerings. If you are a registered user, we may also use this data
to provide you a more personalized Web site experience and to tailor special
offers, product and service updates, or other promotional materials that we may send you. If you do not wish to receive these
offers or promotions, simply indicate your contact preferences during the
registration process or <a href="http://www.quicken.com/quicken/go?dest=webq.reg.optout.email">click here</a>. We do not share your information with
outside companies for their promotional use.  We do not track URLs that you
type into your browser, nor do we track across the Internet once you leave our
site. 
</li></ul>

<span class="fRC"><a name="choice">We give you choices about how the
personally identifiable information that you to provide us may be used.</a></span>
<p>We give you the opportunity to
control the use of the personally identifiable information that you provide us
for purposes other than to fulfill your request. We will provide you the
opportunity to opt-out of secondary uses of personally identifiable information
you provide us, whenever we gather it. Simply notify us during registration or

</p>

<span class="fRC"><a name="security">We work to protect personally identifiable
information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration.</a></span><p></p>

<p>We employ industry recognized
security safeguards to help protect the personally identifiable information you
provide us from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration. Whenever we prompt
you to transmit sensitive information, such as a credit card number, to us
through our Web site, we support the encrypted transmission of that data. </p>

<p>We work to protect personally
identifiable information stored on our sites' servers from unauthorized access
using industry standard computer security products such as firewalls, as well
as carefully developed security procedures and practices. All Intuit employees
must review and sign a written statement with these practices, which include
limiting access to sensitive information to only those employees who require
the information and enforcing strict password protocols for all employees. In
addition, a username and password are required for you to use, view or change
application or interview information. We use both internal and external
resources to review the adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.</p>

<span class="fRC"><a name="contact">We provide various ways for you to contact
