<p align="left">Here is how and why we use some common Web technologies to help manage our Web sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cookies.</b> A "cookie" is a small piece of information that our Web site may provide to your browser while you are at our sites. The Quicken Web sites supply your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas). These cookies are not linked to the personally identifiable information that you provide us elsewhere on the site.<br><br>
If you are a registered user on the Quicken Web sites, you will receive an additional cookie when you login. This cookie is maintained by your browser and contains your identifier. This cookie is also used to authenticate your identity and provide you with access to areas of our Web site that are limited to registered users, such as those that allow you to view and manage your portfolio or accounts.<br><br>
You do not have to accept cookies from our site. Only the areas that require registration require cookies. Should you decide that you would like to register and login to special areas of the Web site and you have modified your browser settings not to accept cookies, you will need to re-set your browser to accept the cookies that we send it. Otherwise, we will not be able to let you participate in certain areas of the Web sites. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies.<br><br>
Advertising networks that serve ads on this Web site may assign different cookies to you. Those cookies may be used to track your involvement with the advertising on our site. You may choose not to accept these cookies. Intuit does not control those parties. You should review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use private information. If you have questions about our ad serving networks, please contact us at <a href="https://orderupdate.intuit.com/privacy.asp?topic=privacy&amp;">

</li><li><b>Web Site Usage Data.</b> With or without cookies, our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL. We use this data to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer. This information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting. This log information is not linked to personally identifiable information gathered elsewhere on the site.<br><br>
</li><li><b>Co-branded and Third-Party Sites.</b> Our co-branded sites are clearly identified by both an Intuit and a partner's logo. The Quicken Web sites may provide links to third-party Web sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. On these sites either Intuit or its partners may collect information about you. Intuit is not responsible for the actions of these third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personally identifiable information.</li></ul>
<p align="left">If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we'll post those changes to this privacy statement 30 days before they take effect.</p>
<p align="left">In some cases we may be required to disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant.</p>
<p align="left"><a name="choice"><b>We give you choices about how the personally identifiable information that you provide us may be used.</b></a></p>
<p align="left">We give you the opportunity to keep us from using or sharing the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us for purposes other than to fulfill your request. We will provide you the opportunity to opt-out of secondary uses of personally identifiable information you provide us, whenever we gather it.

Whenever you transmit sensitive information, such as a credit card number, to us through our Web site, we provide you access to our server that allows encryption of your data as it travels across the Internet.</p>
<p align="left">We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the sites' servers from unauthorized access using commercially available computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully developed security procedures and practices. All employees must review and sign these practices which include limiting access to sensitive information only to those employees who require the information and enforcing strict password protocols for all employees. In addition, a username and password are required for you to use, view or change application or interview information.
