<b>1.	WHO WE ARE</b> <br>
Cupid plc is the data controller (for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998).  We make an annual notification to the Information Commissioner (our registration number is Z2205182).
We own and/or operate a large number of social, dating, lifestyle and entertainment sites (including mobile applications/apps) through our Group Companies and Partner Sites.  We refer to our sites and apps as, collectively, the “Services” within this policy.
Some of our terms will make reference to our Group Companies or Partner Sites and any reference in this policy to “us” or “we” or “our” will include our Group Companies and Partner Sites.<br>
<b>(a)	ABOUT OUR GROUP COMPANIES</b><br>
As a large organisation we have a number of subsidiary companies (“Group Companies”) that operate some of our sites on our behalf or provide services to us to enable us to provide the Services to you. We have subsidiaries in the UK, France, Germany, Cyprus and USA and other locations as may be determined from time to time.  For data protection purposes, these companies are called data processors.  Our Group Companies are all wholly/majorly owned by us.
<br>

To find out more about our full network of sites please visit our company website Cupid plc.
We want to offer you a full range of products and services and in order to do that we will share your details across our Partner Sites (See below Creation of duplicate profiles across our Partner Sites) and we will market our different products and services to you (See below Marketing).

<b>(d)	When we disclose your information to third parties and why</b><br>
We may be required by law e.g. through potential or actual litigation, court order, public or governmental authorities, or rules and regulations within or out with your country of residence to disclose all or part of your information to third parties.  We may also deem it necessary to make such a disclosure in the event of an issue of national security, law enforcement or other such similar situations as we deem necessary including, for example, allegations of alleged infringement of copyright, trade marks or other third parties’ rights by users.
We share your personal information with third party service providers in order to provide the Services to you including third parties who assist us with information processing, credit and payment processing, fulfilment of your subscription order, managing and hosting data, conducting consumer research or satisfaction surveys. 
These disclosures relate to providing our Services, improving our Services and delivering targeted advertising to you.  We do not provide your contact details to third parties for direct marketing by them to you without your express consent, which will be obtained from you at sign up process if you elect to provide this consent.
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy assets. In such transactions, the information we have collected about you will generally be one of the transferred business assets. Also in the unlikely event that any of our Group Companies or our assets are purchased, your information will also be one of the transferred assets. We may share information about you with: 
Other companies in the same corporate group as us.
A buyer or prospective buyer of our business.
Our professional advisers, such as our lawyers, where it is necessary for them to advise us.
Other persons if we are under a duty to disclose or share your information in order to comply with any legal obligation.<br>
<b>5.	MARKETING</b><br>
<b>(a)	When we market to you directly about our products and services</b><br>
We may share your information with our Partner Sites and Group Companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising to you of our Partner Sites and Group Companies’ products and services, or to help us to prepare marketing reports.
We may send you information about our Partner Sites and Group Companies’ products and services, news and offers, and selected third party products and services that we think may be of interest to you.
We may do this by contacting you through your email address or mobile phone number that you have provided.  Any communication received from us, as consented to by you, will clearly state that it is being sent by us.
You have the option to opt-out of our marketing communications at any time (see below).<br>
<b>(b)	When third parties market to you (Our “third party Partner Services”) </b><br>
If you have consented to receive marketing communications from third parties during our sign up process, referred to as Partner Services, your data may be passed on to such third parties as we enter into data sharing agreements with, from time to time, for marketing and analytical reporting purposes. We cannot be held liable for the content of the third party’s communications or products/services they are promoting. 
If you have provided this consent, but change your mind, you can opt-out at any time (see below).  Please be advised that you will also require to contact the individual third parties who have been marketing to you if you wish to stop receiving their communications directly.<br>
<b>(c)	Opting Out of Marketing</b><br>
If you change your mind about the marketing consent you have granted to us, you can amend your preferences under the “My Account” section of your chosen Site or emailing us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@quickflirt.com">unsubscribe@quickflirt.com</a><br>
<b>6.	WHERE WE STORE YOUR DATA</b><br>
The personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a location outside the European Economic Area (<b>'EEA'</b>) including but not limited to Canada where we host our servers. It may also be processed by law enforcement agencies, employees and independent contractors of our Group Companies located outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers (for example, staff who are involved in providing services that you order from us, processing your payment details or providing support services to us). By submitting your personal data to us, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.<br>
<b>7.	HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR DATA FOR</b><br>
Generally speaking, we only store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Services to you and others, with information typically being held until you cancel your membership.  
<br>
For data storage purposes however our users are considered as either being:
<br>
(a) Active Users; this means you regularly log on to our Services and use the Services in any way;<br>
(b) Inactive Users: this means that you have not cancelled your account but you haven’t logged in for 4 months, or conducted any activity on our Services in that time;<br>
(c) Cancelled: this means that you have followed our cancellation process and actively cancelled your membership.<br>
<b>(a) Active Users</b><br>
If you are an Active User we will store your data until you cancel your account.<br>
<b>(b)	Inactive Users</b><br>
If you are an Inactive User, you should be aware that we will continue to store your data until you cancel you account, including continue to market to you if you have consented to marketing.  
Just because you haven’t logged on for a few months, we hope you will return to use the Services regularly and we want your information to be there for your convenience so you should be aware that you will still appear in our search results for other users, and your profile will remain visible.  
The responsibility to change your preferences or cancel your account lies with you.<br>
<b>(c)	Cancelled Users</b><br>
If you are a Cancelled User, we will delete all of your data 9 months after the date of cancellation.   It is important that we retain your data for this short period after cancellation to ensure that we can answer any payment or other account related queries, or provide information to third parties in line with our disclosure provisions outlined in this policy e.g. assisting police investigations. 
Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may still be viewable and/or accessed on the Internet to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by other users or to the extent such information has been shared with search engines. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this.
