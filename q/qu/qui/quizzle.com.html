    <p>At <em>Quizzle</em>, we respect and protect the privacy of those who visit or use our web site. When we collect information from you, we want you to know how it is used. To demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices, we have adopted leading industry privacy guidelines.</p>

    <p><em>Quizzle</em> does not share your personal information outside the <em>Quizzle</em> family of companies for promotional use.</p>

    <p>Because of the financial nature of our business, our web sites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. Therefore, we don’t knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children.</p>

    <h2>Our Philosophy and Practices</h2>

    <p>At <em>Quizzle</em>, we want you to be comfortable and confident when using our web site. Therefore, we would like to share with you the following principles that govern our information practices and other privacy aspects of our web site:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="/security-and-privacy#s1">We provide you notice of our web site information practices.</a></li>
        <li><a href="/security-and-privacy#s2">We tell you how and why we use Web technologies.</a></li>
        <li><a href="/security-and-privacy#s3">We provide you the opportunity to update or correct your personally identifiable information.</a></li>
        <li><a href="/security-and-privacy#s5">We work to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration.</a></li>
        <li><a href="/security-and-privacy#s6">We provide various ways for you to contact us about our information practices and other aspects of privacy.</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="s1">We Provide You Notice of Our Web Site Information Practices.</h2>

    <p>To maximize the value of our services, we may request information from you when you visit our web sites. <em>Quizzle</em> does not share your personal information outside the <em>Quizzle</em> family of companies for promotional use.</p>

    <p>Here is a description of the information we collect and how it is used:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Tools, Applications and Registration:</strong> In order to use our services, we will ask you to register at the site and supply other identifying and supporting information needed to use the site. By registering, you can save information for later review and update. When you register, you will choose a user ID name by which we will know you, a password and provide us an e-mail address. You use the user ID name and password to gain access to your information, financial profile and/or customized loan options. We use your contact information to provide you with alerts and updates regarding our service. <em>Quizzle</em> does not share your information outside the <em>Quizzle</em> family of companies for promotional use.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>More on our general information practices.</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Newsletters:</strong> We provide you the opportunity to subscribe to e-mail newsletters and other e-mail communications. You may unsubscribe by following the instructions provided in each e-mail newsletter.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Interactive Help (Chat / PC to Phone):</strong> You may be given the opportunity to initiate an online interactive discussion or PC to Phone communication with a <em>Quizzle</em> support professional. We do not ask for any personally identifiable information to use this service; if you volunteer personally identifiable information, it will only be used to respond to your request. We maintain transcripts of chat sessions.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Phone Calls:</strong> We will not telephone you unless you request to be called. Within the <em>Quizzle</em> Web site, we provide you the opportunity to make inquiries as to programs and services offered by <em>Quizzle</em> and partners of <em>Quizzle</em>, and to give <em>Quizzle</em> and partners of <em>Quizzle</em> permission to contact you by telephone or fax, even if your telephone number is on the “Do Not Call” list. If you subsequently wish to opt-out from receiving telephone calls from <em>Quizzle</em>, you may opt-out.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Mandatory and Optional Information:</strong> We identify what information is required to fulfill your request. If you chose not to provide mandatory information, we will not be able to provide you the service you are requesting.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>E-mail Message Formatting:</strong> When sending you e-mail we may use an image called a single-pixel GIF, that allows us to (1) format messages that best align with your computer’s capabilities, and (2) determine whether you’ve opened an HTML e-mail. When you click on a link within an e-mail message, you will first pass through our server, and then are redirected onto the Internet. We use this data on an aggregate level to evaluate response rates to our e-mail messages and to determine which links are most useful to our customer base.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Within the <em>Quizzle</em> Family:</strong> Within the <em>Quizzle</em> family, which includes Quicken Loans, One Reverse Mortgage, In-House Realty, Title Source, Inc., and <a href="/company/partners">other partners</a>, we may exchange customer information to fulfill your requests or to provide you with information about other products or services, if you have chosen to receive such communications.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> In some cases, we will employ or use service providers such as title companies, appraisers, consultants, temporary workers, third party software developers, to complete a business process or provide a service on our behalf. For example, we may use service providers to enhance our Web site technology, deliver products, or to send e-mails. When we employ service providers, we may need to share your personally identifiable information. Service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for purposes other than to act on our behalf.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Service Alerts and Critical Notices:</strong> Although we respect and honor the privacy preferences you have expressed, we may need to contact you to inform you of specific changes that may impact your ability to use this service or for other critical non-marketing purposes, such as bug alerts. We may also contact you to respond to your specific requests, to clarify the order information you provided to us, or to notify you of upcoming subscription expiration dates.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Change of Control:</strong> Your personally identifiable information may be transferred in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of <em>Quizzle</em>. You will have the opportunity to opt out of further secondary use of your information following any change of control.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Changes to Our Privacy Policy:</strong> If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we’ll post those changes to the <em>Quizzle</em> web site 30 days before they take effect.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Legal Disclosures:</strong> In some cases we may disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request.</p></li>

All data sent to <em>Quizzle</em> is protected with technology that enables encryption of your data. We use:</p>

    <ul class="privacyList">
        <li><p><strong>Secure Socket Layer (SSL):</strong> The <em>Quizzle</em> Web server supports the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) transaction protocol originally developed by Netscape and now largely accepted as an industry standard. The purpose of this encryption protocol is to keep confidential the information passed back and forth between a Web server and its users.</p></li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>128-Bit Domestic Grade Strong Encryption:</strong> <em>Quizzle</em> uses 128-Bit Domestic Grade Strong Encryption, the most powerful encryption commercially available for Internet products. (However, be aware that if you are using a 40-bit browser, your encryption level, while secure, is not the highest level available. United States and Canadian citizens can download free 128-bit browsers from Mozilla, Netscape or Microsoft). We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the site’s servers from unauthorized access using industry standard computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully developed security procedures and practices. All employees must review and sign a written statement of these practices which include limiting access to sensitive information to only those employees who require the information and enforcing strict password protocols for all employees. In addition, a username, member ID name and password are required for you to use, view or change application or interview information. We use both internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.</p>

    <h2 id="s2">We Tell You How and Why We Use Web Technologies.</h2>

    <p>Here is how and why we use some common Web technologies to help manage our web sites:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Cookies:</strong> A “cookie” is a small piece of information that our web site may provide to your browser while you are at our sites. The <em>Quizzle</em> web site supplies your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to better understand web site usage in the aggregate and on an individual level so we know what areas of our site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas). This is done through a tracking utility that allows us, for example, to reconstruct activity from a session or by a user, for troubleshooting and issue resolution purposes. <em>Quizzle</em> may also employ service providers to help us collect and understand our web site usage data.</p>
            <p>When periodic surveys are presented to web site visitors, cookies are used to prevent issuing multiple invitations to the same individual.</p>
            <p>If you are a registered member on the <em>Quizzle</em> web site, you will receive a cookie when you login. This cookie is maintained by your browser and contains your identifier. This cookie is also used to authenticate your identity and provide you with access to areas of our web site that are limited to registered members, such as those that allow you to view and manage your personal profile.</p>
            <p>Additionally, <em>Quizzle</em> service providers that serve ads on affiliate and/or advertiser web sites may assign different cookies and small graphical images called single-pixel GIFs or web beacons, to your browser to track the effectiveness of <em>Quizzle</em> advertising on other web sites and your involvement with <em>Quizzle</em>. For example, as part of the <em>Quizzle</em> affiliate programs, our service providers use cookies and web beacons to determine when affiliate program members have referred a customer to <em>Quizzle</em> via a link on their web site. The <em>Quizzle</em> web site also sets a temporary cookie that contains a unique, anonymous identifier that is provided to the service provider to ensure that each referral is only counted once. This cookie is not linked to a customer’s personal information. The cookies and web beacons are necessary to ensure that affiliate program members are appropriately credited for their referrals. Service providers report data in the aggregate and do not link it to individual customer information. <em>Quizzle</em> may also employ service providers who may assign cookies or web beacons to your browser to assist us in collecting web site usage data such as your IP address, session ID, URL and demographic information such as your zip code. The collection of data may include personally identifiable information. We do not track URLs that you type into your browser, nor do we track you across the Internet once you leave our site.</p>
            <p>If you simply want to browse, you do not have to accept cookies from our site. Should you decide, however, that you would like to register and sign in to special areas of the web site and you have modified your browser settings not to accept cookies, you will need to re-set your browser to accept the cookies that we send. Otherwise, you won’t be able to participate in certain areas of the web site. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Behavioral Advertising:</strong> Please be aware that we use third party advertising companies to collect non-personally identifiable information for online behavioral advertising to provide targeted display advertisements, likely to be of greater interest to you, through participating publishers and advertisers. Such information may include non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) through the use of Cookies and other technology. To learn more about online behavioral advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising, please click on the following link: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Web Site Usage Data:</strong> Our web site tracks usage data, including, for example, your IP address, your browser type and version, which pages you view, which page, if any, linked you to our site, and which link, if any, you follow off of our site. We use this data in the aggregate and on an individual level to better understand web site activity to improve our site offerings, to reconstruct activity from a session or by a user, for troubleshooting and issue resolution purposes. We may also use this data to provide you a more personalized web site experience, or for assistance with technical support questions.</p>
            <p>We do not share your information outside the <em>Quizzle</em> Family of companies for promotional use. We do not track URLs that you type into your browser, nor do we track you across the Internet once you leave our site.</p>
