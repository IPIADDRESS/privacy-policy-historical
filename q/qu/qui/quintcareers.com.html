<p>g) <strong>Apply Tool Privacy Notice and Information We Collect.</strong> We can automatically collect certain information (including Personal Information) from your device or web browser. We can automatically collect information from location storage associated with your web browser, including your browsing behavior for career searching activity. We can also automatically record your interactions with certain webpages by accessing local storage associated with your web browser. The Apply Tool was made to automatically interact with third party websites, so we can also collect some non-personal data about you when you visit those websites including, clickstream data, operating system being used, the URL of the site you have come from and move to after your visit, data relating to your activities on third party websites (including IP addresses and URLs) via tracking technologies (such as cookies and measurement software), the date and time of your visit and your server's IP address, the geo-location of your device, and the type of payment you use. We collect this information for statistical purposes to find out how our website and the Apply Tool are being used. We can use this information to evaluate and, hopefully, improve your experience. As an example, when you visit a webpage that supports the autofill function, we can record metadata generated by your web browser that identifies one or more autofill fields that you interact with. In this example, we can also access local storage associated with your web browser to determine information (including Personal Information) which can be or has been entered into an autofill field. We use your information to facilitate your completion of job applications across the internet, on our websites and third-party websites and to provide advertising and/or other content that we believe can be of interest to you based upon your browsing behavior on the internet.

Unless required by law, we are not responsible for informing third parties (including without limitation our third party service providers, potential employers, job-posting sites you authorize us to contact on your behalf, or strategic or marketing partners) with whom we have already shared your information of any changes requested pursuant to this section, or for removing information from or causing information to be removed from the databases or records of such entities.</p>

<p><a id="policySection6"></a></p>

<h6>6. Information You Share on the Site.</h6>

<p>If you participate in Provider services (e.g., resume posting, profile creation, Job Alerts) that permit you or Provider on your behalf to post information on third party sites (e.g., websites, bulletin boards, personal urls) and if you post information or content, such as by posting photos, or participating in online forums or communities, when you interact with our Site through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, depending upon your privacy settings, this information can become public on the Internet. We cannot prevent further use of this information. You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites. Please refer to those third party sites’ privacy policies and terms of use to learn more about their privacy practices, which we do not control.</p>

<p><strong>Other services:</strong> If you use the Site, Provider can create a universal application derived from the information you provide on the Site that will be visible to potential employers who have immediate needs for prospects as well as visitors to the Site. Therefore, your Site Profile can be publicly viewable. You can elect to have your Profile restricted to registered users only by following the instructions on the Site for that particular setting. You agree that employers and Provider will use the contact information you have provided to contact you by e-mail and you understand that this consent is not a condition to having access to the Site or Provider services. </p>

<p>If you opt-in to our SMS alert service, you acknowledge that message or data charges may apply. If you wish to not continue with the SMS alert service, you may opt-out by replying “STOP” to the SMS text you received or contact our customer service.  Please allow 3 to 5 business days to process your request.  Provider reserves the right to terminate at its sole discretion the SMS alert service for any reason at any time.</p>

<p><a id="policySection7"></a></p>

<h6>7. Tracking Technologies (Cookies)</h6>

<p>When you visit the Site, we and our business partners can use tracking technologies to enhance your online experience or customize our offerings. A few additional important things you should know about our use of tracking technologies (cookies):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We can offer certain features that are available only through the use of tracking technologies.</p></li>
<li><p>We use both session and persistent tracking technologies. Tracking technologies (e.g., cookies) can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). You are always free to decline tracking technologies if your browser permits, although doing so can interfere with your use of the Site. Refer to the help section of your browser, browser extensions, or installed applications for instructions on blocking, deleting, or disabling tracking technologies such as cookies.</p></li>
<li><p>We encode and protect the tracking technologies that Provider sets, so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You can encounter tracking technologies/cookies from our third party service providers, that we have allowed on our Site that assist us with various aspects of our Site operations and services, such as Google Analytics.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also encounter tracking technologies from third parties on certain pages of the websites that we do not control and have not authorized. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there can be a cookie placed by that web page).</p></li>
<li><p>We can target and track the videos you view on the Site. You consent to our tracking of your video viewing through the Site or third party social media for up to two years or as permitted by applicable law.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For more information about the use of cookies and similar technology on our Site please review this Privacy Policy and our <a href="/cookie-tracking-policy#CTCookiesSection4">Tracking Technologies Policy</a>.</p>

<p><a id="policySection8"></a></p>

<h6>8. Accessing, Reviewing, and Changing Your Personal Information</h6>

<p>Registered members can review and change Personal Information at any time by accessing their accounts on the Site (through the My Account and My Settings tabs). You should promptly update your Personal Information if it changes or becomes inaccurate. We can retain some information from closed accounts so that we can comply with law, prevent fraud, assist with investigations, resolve disputes, analyze or troubleshoot programs, enforce our Terms of Use, or take other actions permitted by law. Likewise, if your account or membership is terminated or suspended, we can maintain some information to prevent re-registration. For non-registered members, you can update or request to access your Personal Information by contacting us as set forth in Section 15. We will endeavor to comply with your requests as soon as reasonably possible but please note that changes requested of us are not always effective immediately. Unless required by law, we are not responsible for informing third parties (including without limitation our third party service providers, potential employers, job-posting sites you authorize us to contact on your behalf, or strategic or marketing partners) with whom we have already shared your information of any changes requested pursuant to this section, or for removing information from or causing information to be removed from the databases or records of such entities.</p>

<p><a id="policySection9"></a></p>

<h6>9. Notice to California Residents</h6>

<p>a) California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what Personal Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests can be made only once a year and are free of charge. To make such a request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:californiarequest@bold.com">californiarequest@bold.com</a>. For all requests, you must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. In the body of your request, please provide enough information for us to determine if this applies to you. You need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. Please note that we will not accept requests via the telephone, mail, or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.</p>

<p>b) California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575 (b) provides that California residents are entitled to know how Provider responds to "Do Not Track" browser settings. Provider does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been adopted. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is universally accepted.</p>

<p><a id="policySection10"></a></p>

<h6>10. Notice to Residents of the European Union</h6>

<p>Provider complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR"). As such, Provider affords to all European data subjects their respective data privacy rights to the extent they are applicable including: (i) right to rectify inaccurate data; (ii) right to erasure (deletion of your Personal Information); (iii) right to restrict processing of your Personal Information; (iv) right of data portability; and (v) right to object. You can exercise any of these rights by contacting us at <a href="mailto:boldforeigndispute@bold.com">boldforeigndispute@bold.com</a> or <a href="/contact-us">contact-us</a>. In order to safeguard your Personal Information from unauthorized access, we can ask that you provide sufficient information to identify yourself prior to providing access to your Personal Information.</p>

<p>In certain situations, and subject to applicable law, Provider will not be able or obliged to comply with part or all of your individual requests. Please note that we have the right to refuse and/or charge a monetary fee for requests which are manifestly unfounded or excessive, for example due to their repetitive character. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to an EU Supervisory Authority. </p>

<p>Providing your information to us is optional, but it can impact our ability to offer the Service to you. For example, if you do not provide your complete Personal Information, we will not always be able to respond to your request in a timely manner. </p>

<p><a id="policySection11"></a></p>

<h6>11. Third Parties</h6>

<p>Our Site can contain links to other third party websites and Provider can provide products and services that share information with third party sites for your job search. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third party sites so it is important to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies before providing your Personal Information.
<a id="policySection11"></a></p>

<h6>12. Information Security</h6>

<p>We maintain technical, physical, and administrative security measures designed to protect the security of your Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorized or accidental access, disclosure, copying, use or alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, information access authorization controls and other measures in accordance with industry standards. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is totally secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p>

<p><a id="policySection12"></a></p>

<h6>13. Children's Privacy</h6>

<p>The Site is a general audience site and it is not intended for children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information via our websites, applications, services, or tools from users in this age group.</p>

<p>If you are a minor and want to remove the information you posted to the Site, please contact us via the email or mailing address listed in <a href="#policySection16">Section 16</a> below. Removal of the information you posted does not ensure its complete or comprehensive removal.</p>

<p><a id="policySection14"></a></p>

<h6>14. Storage and International Transfer</h6>

<p>As we operate internationally, and many of our computer systems are currently based globally, for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy your Personal Information can be stored and processed elsewhere by us, our affiliates or an unaffiliated service provider. The data protection and privacy regulations do not always offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Economic Area (“EEA”). When you create an account/profile or otherwise provide us with Personal Information, you consent to the collection, storage and/or processing of your Personal Information in the United States, Canada and other countries of your Personal Information and tracking technologies/cookies as described in this Privacy Policy.  We take appropriate measures to ensure adequate protection of the privacy rights of EEA data subjects with respect to Personal Information that we transfer outside the EEA to a country that is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission. To obtain a copy of the relevant transfer mechanism or additional information on the transfers, please address these requests to <a href="/contact-us">contact-us</a>. </p>

<p><a id="policySection15"></a></p>

<h6>15. Notification Regarding Updates.</h6>

<p>From time to time, we can choose to update this Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy posted at any time or from time to time via this Site shall be deemed to be the Privacy Policy then in effect. You agree that we can notify you about material changes in the way we treat Personal Information by placing a notice on the Site. You should check the Site frequently for updates.  In addition, we have provided the Privacy Policy Highlights section to offer a summary of the main points of our Full Privacy Policy for your convenience.  In the event of a conflict between the Privacy Policy Highlights and the Full Privacy Policy, the Full Privacy Policy will control.</p>
