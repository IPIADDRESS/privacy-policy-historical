    the enquiry and in case additional questions arise.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Technical notifications concerning our service.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · Sending newsletters or other advertising material, providing that you have given us your corresponding approval.
</p>
<p>
    4.3.
</p>
<p>
    If users sign up using the Facebook authentication functions, the Facebook ID of the users will be stored.
</p>
<p>
    4.4.
</p>
<p>
    If the Service is carried out as a Facebook application, the permission of users is required for the Service Provider to access their stored data on
    Facebook. Users are expressly referred in the context of the Facebook consent dialog to this data collection and the data shared by Facebook with the
    Service Provider (public profile, friends list, e-mail address and "Like" information) through the application. Users are referred to Facebook’s privacy
    policy <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info-on-other">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info-on-other</a> for more
    information about the consent process, consent granted and ways of revoking such consent within their Facebook profile. Users have the option in the

</p>
<p>
    <strong>5.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Registration through authentication services of third parties</strong>
</p>
<p>
    5.1.
</p>
<p>
    Users can register and log in by using authentication services of third parties, as far as these are available (hereinafter referred to as "authentication
    by a third party"). Particularly Facebook, Google+ or Twitter can be possible authentication service providers.
</p>
<p>
    5.2.
</p>
<p>
    As requirement for the authentication through a third party, users should be registered at the respective third party and enter the necessary login details
    in the appropriate web formula or should be already logged in to the third party.
</p>
<p>
    5.3.
</p>
<p>
    In the context of a registration, the Service Provider receives a user-ID with the information under which the user with this user ID is logged in and an
    ID that cannot be further used by the Service Provider (User Handle). Whether the Service Provider receives further data depends only on the user who uses
    the authentication by a third party, the data that is selected to be released in the context of the authentication, and which data has been authorised by
    the user in the privacy or other settings of the user account at the third party. The data can differ, depending on the provider and the selections of the
    user; normally these are the e-mail address and the user name. In case of Facebook, this is also the - so called - "public profile information" that can be
    seen by everyone. This includes the name, profile and cover picture, gender, networks (i.e. school or working place), user name (Facebook URL) and user
    identification number (Facebook ID).
</p>
<p>
    5.4.
</p>
<p>
    The password that has been entered in the context of the authentication by a third party cannot be seen by the Service Provider, neither can it be saved by
    the Service Provider.
</p>
<p>
    5.5.
</p>
<p>
    The users are asked to keep in mind that their data, which is saved by the Service Provider, can be compared and synchronized with their user account at
    the third party automatically. There is no obligation however for the Service Provider to update the data.
</p>
<p>
    5.6.
</p>
<p>
    In the case that users decide that they do not wish to further use the connection of their user account at the third party for the authentication by a
    third party, they must cancel this connection within their user account at the third party. If the users wish to delete their data at the Service Provider,
    they must cancel their account at the Service Provider.
</p>
<p>
    5.7.
</p>
<p>
    During the use of authentication by a third party, the users are asked to keep in mind the applicable Terms of Use, as well as the Rules for Data Use of
the third party. These can be found: Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/tos">https://twitter.com/tos</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/privacy">https://twitter.com/privacy</a>), Google (<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/">http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/</a>), Facebook (    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/">https://www.facebook.com/policies/</a>).

    <strong>6.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sending Information by Newsletter and Email</strong>
</p>
<p>
    6.1.
</p>
<p>
    Newsletters and emails that are not service-related, are not fulfilling our duties to perform our service and contain advertisement will only be send to
    you, if you have given us your prior consent.
</p>
<p>
    6.2.
</p>
<p>
    The content of the newsletter or email follows from its respective description. If no description is available, the content sent comprises information
    about us and our services, as well as information on our events or third party information and events.
</p>
<p>
    6.3.
</p>
<p>
    If you no longer want to receive our newsletter you can opt to stop receiving it at any time. Opt-out possibilities are included in each mail and may also
    be changed within your account settings.
</p>
<p>
    6.4.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>You also give us the consent to store your IP addresses and the timestamp as part of the sign-up process.</strong>
    We are legally bound to record the log-on process so as to be able to verify that logging on is done in accordance with regulations.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>7.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Server Log-Files</strong>
</p>
<p>
    7.1.
</p>
<p>
    During every visit of our Service information about IP address, referring URL, date/time, browser version and operating system, amount and state of
    transferred data is stored in the web server log files.
</p>
<p>
    7.2.
</p>
<p>
    We use the log data without any other personal or pseudonymous profiling as required by law only for the purpose of the operation, security and
    optimization of our service
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Incorporation of third party services and content</strong>
</p>
<p>
    8.1.
</p>
<p>
    Third party content, such as videos from YouTube, map material from Google Maps, RSS feeds and graphics from other Services, for example, can be
    incorporated on the Service.
</p>
<p>
    8.2.
</p>
<p>
    This always presupposes that the provider of this content (hereafter referred to as the “third party provider”) always uses the user’s IP address. This is
    because without the IP address, they cannot send the content to the respective user’s browser. The IP address is thus required for displaying this content.
</p>
<p>
    8.3.
</p>
<p>
    We endeavour only to use content of which the respective provider uses the IP address only for distributing the content. However, we have no influence on
    whether the third party provider saves the IP address for other purposes, such as statistical purposes, for example. If we are aware of this, we will
    clarify this in the following paragraphs.
</p>

    Irland ("Facebook"). The Remarketing pixel allows us and Facebook to determine the relevant target audiences, in order to display advertisements
    (hereinafter referred to as "Facebook-Ads") in reference to potential interests of the users. We use the Remarketing pixels, because we want to display
    Facebook-Ads only to users, who displayed an interest in our services. The Visitors Action pixels allow us and Facebook to determine, whether our Ads were
    effective and satisfactory for users by being able to comprehend users actions, after they were forwarded to our services by clicking a Facebook-Ad.
