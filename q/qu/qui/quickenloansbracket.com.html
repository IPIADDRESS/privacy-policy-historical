    <p>To maximize the value of our services, we may request information from you when you visit our websites. Quicken Loans does not share your personal information with outside companies for their promotional use.</p>
    <p>Here is a description of the information we collect and how it is used:</p>

    <h2>Protecting Your Identity and Credit</h2>
    <p>Credit reporting agencies may share your information with other companies when you apply for a home loan. This may cause you to receive Email or phone calls that you didn't ask for, offering credit cards, refinancing or other loan products.</p>
    <p>You can stop these calls and Emails by opting out of these prescreened credit offers. Simply call (888) 567-8688 or visit <a class="window_open" href="http://www.optoutprescreen.com">www.optoutprescreen.com</a>.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Tools, Applications and Registration:</strong> We provide a number of ways for you to explore your options for mortgages and loans, so you can determine which options may be the most desirable for you. You can engage a number of tools, planners, calculators and other interactive advisors, such as the online interviews, without providing us your identity. We will not ask you for personally identifiable information to use these features, and do not attribute the information that you provide to you as an individual.</p>
            <p>However, if you want to exercise one or more of the loan options presented, we will ask you to register at the site and supply other identifying and supporting information needed to process your application.</p>
            <p>By registering, you can save information such as loan interviews and applications for later review and update. When you register, you select a member ID name by which we will know you, choose a password and provide us an Email address. You use the member ID name and password to gain access to your loan application information, financial profile and/or customized rates. We use your contact information to provide you with alerts and updates regarding your loan status, which is part of the Quicken Loans service. Quicken Loans does not share your information with outside companies for their promotional use. We may, however, use it to send you communications and special offers on other products or services offered by Quicken Loans. If you do not want to receive this information you may opt-out during registration, within any future communications or by sending an Email to <a href="mailto:optout@QuickenLoans.com">optout@QuickenLoans.com</a>. You may also <a href="/about/legal/contact-options">click here</a> to change your contact preferences.</p>
            <p>We may also supply the information you provide, on a strictly confidential basis, to service providers, such as title companies, appraisers, credit reporting services, etc., who assist us in qualifying, processing, closing and servicing your loan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Credit Report:</strong> By submitting a loan application or a request to be pre-qualified to us, you authorize us to share your credit report with our affiliates only to process your loan application.</p>

    <h2 id="section5">WE WORK TO PROTECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION FROM LOSS, MISUSE, OR UNAUTHORIZED ALTERATION.</h2>
    <p>We employ industry recognized security safeguards to help protect the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration. All data sent to Quicken Loans is protected with technology that enables encryption of your data. We use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Secure Socket Layer (SSL):</strong> The Quicken Loans Web server supports the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) transaction protocol originally developed by Netscape and now largely accepted as an industry standard. The purpose of this encryption protocol is to keep confidential the information passed back and forth between a Web server and its users.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>128-Bit Domestic Grade Strong Encryption:</strong> Quicken Loans uses 128-Bit Domestic Grade Strong Encryption, a powerful encryption commercially available for Internet products. (However, be aware that if you are using a 40-bit browser, your encryption level, while secure, is not the highest level available. United States and Canadian citizens can download free 128-bit browsers from <a class="window_open" href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>, or <a class="window_open" href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>.</p>
            <p>We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the site's servers from unauthorized access using industry standard computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully developed security procedures and practices. All employees must review and sign a written statement of these practices which include limiting access to sensitive information to only those employees who require the information and enforcing strict password protocols for all employees. In addition, a username, member ID name and password are required for you to use, view or change application or interview information. We use both internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.</p>

    <h2 id="section2">WE TELL YOU HOW AND WHY WE USE WEB TECHNOLOGIES.</h2>
    <p>Here is how and why we use some common Web technologies to help manage our websites:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Cookies:</strong> A "cookie" is a small piece of information that our website may provide to your browser while you are at our sites. The Quicken Loans website supplies your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to better understand website usage in the aggregate and on an individual level so we know what areas of our site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas). This is done through a tracking utility that allows us, for example, to reconstruct activity from a session or by a user, for troubleshooting and issue resolution purposes. Quicken Loans may also employ service providers to help us collect and understand our website usage data.</p>
            <p>When periodic surveys are presented to website visitors, cookies are used to prevent issuing multiple invitations to the same individual.</p>
            <p>If you are a registered member on the Quicken Loans website, you will receive a cookie when you login. This cookie is maintained by your browser and contains your identifier. This cookie is also used to authenticate your identity and provide you with access to areas of our website that are limited to registered members, such as those that allow you to view and manage your personal profile.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Quicken Loans service providers that serve ads on affiliate and/or advertiser websites may assign different cookies and small graphical images called single-pixel GIFs or web beacons, to your browser to track the effectiveness of Quicken Loans advertising on other websites and your involvement with Quicken Loans. For example, as part of the Quicken Loans affiliate programs, our service providers use cookies and web beacons to determine when affiliate program members have referred a customer to Quicken Loans via a link on their website. The Quicken Loans website also sets a temporary cookie that contains a unique, anonymous identifier that is provided to the service provider to ensure that each referral is only counted once. This cookie is not linked to a customer's personal information. The cookies and web beacons are necessary to ensure that affiliate program members are appropriately credited for their referrals. Service providers report data in the aggregate and do not link it to individual customer information. Quicken Loans may also employ service providers who may assign cookies or web beacons to your browser to assist us in collecting website usage data such as your IP address, session ID, URL and demographic information such as your zip code. The collection of data may include personally identifiable information. We do not track URLs that you type into your browser, nor do we track you across the Internet once you leave our site.</p>
            <p>If you simply want to browse, you do not have to accept cookies from our site. Should you decide, however, that you would like to register and sign in to special areas of the website and you have modified your browser settings not to accept cookies, you will need to re-set your browser to accept the cookies that we send. Otherwise, you won't be able to participate in certain areas of the website. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies.</p>
            <p>If you wish to remove cookies provided by Quicken Loans, from your browser, you may learn how to do so by <a href="/about/legal/delete-browser-cookies">clicking here</a>. Since most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies, you will most likely have to set your browser to reject new cookies or to disable them altogether, in order to avoid receiving future cookies from the Quicken Loans website. Please note that if you choose to reject or disable cookies, your access to certain areas within the Quicken Loans website may be limited.</p>
