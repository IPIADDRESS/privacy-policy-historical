<h1 class="sifrize">QuickBase Privacy Statement</h1>
<p>At Intuit Quickbase we place the highest importance on respecting and protecting the privacy of our customers. Our most important asset is our relationship with you. We want you to feel comfortable and confident when using our Web site. Therefore, we would like to share with you the following principles that govern our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web site. Throughout this policy, we refer to information that personally identifies you as "personal information."</p>

<h3>We protect your information</h3>
<p>We work to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration by using industry-recognized security safeguards. We use both internal and external resources to review our security procedures. Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information. <a class="bluelink" href="#protect">Tell me more...</a></p>

<h3>We tell you how we use your information</h3>
<p>When we ask you for information, we will tell you, --or it will be clear --what we need to know to fulfill your request. We will also tell you how we will use the information we’re asking for. Because of the financial nature of our business, our Web sites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly request or receive any information from children. </p>
<ul>
<li>We do not sell or rent your personal information to anyone.</li>
<li>We do not share your personal information with anyone outside of Intuit for their promotional, including marketing, use.</li>
</ul>

<h3>We tell you about our relationships with third parties</h3>
<p>We have limited relationships with third parties to assist us in servicing you, for example, by fulfilling customer orders or providing customer service. These service providers are contractually required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide them. Additionally, we have business partners that provide services, some of which are co-branded. We clearly identify partner services and sites. When you request any of these products or services, you are permitting us to provide your personal information to the partner to fulfill your request. We may disclose your information if we are required to by a law enforcement action such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant. <a class="bluelink" href="#thirdparty">Tell me more...</a></p>

<h3>We tell you how we use Web technology</h3>
<p>Like many Web sites, we use technology, such as cookies, that allow us to make your visit to our Web site easier by recognizing you when you return and help to provide you with a customized experience. <a href="#webtech">Tell me more...</a></p>

<h3>We give you choice and control</h3>
<p>We may use your contact information to tell you about other products we think might interest you. However, if you don't want us to contact you for promotional purposes, you can tell us when you provide the information. You may also specify your contact preferences by sending us an email to: privacy@quickbase.com Your contact preferences only apply to marketing contacts. We may need to communicate with you regarding the usability of your product or critical messages relating to your service or software (such as service messages, subscription renewal notices, critical notices, or legally mandated notices).</p>

<h3>You can contact us</h3>
<p>If you have privacy-related questions that are not addressed here, please contact the Privacy Team or write us at: Privacy Team, Intuit Inc, 2800 East Commerce Center Place, Tucson, AZ 85706.</p>
<p>If Intuit does not respond or your inquiry has not been addressed to your satisfaction, please contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.</p>
<p>Intuit is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because Intuit wants to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information privacy practices for compliance review by TRUSTe.</p>

<h2><a name="protect">We protect your information</a></h2>
<p>We protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information by using industry-recognized security safeguards such as firewalls, coupled with carefully developed security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration. Whenever we ask for sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, we encrypt it as it is transmitted to us. Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information and, using physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, we restrict access to personal information to those employees and agents for business purposes only. Additionally, we use internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security procedures.</p>

<h2><a class="bluebold" name="webtech">Cookies, Web beacons and other Web technologies</a></h2>
<p>We use a variety of technologies on our Web site. Among these are cookies, which are pieces of information that our Web sites provide to your browser. Cookies allow us to track overall site usage and determine areas users prefer. Cookies also allow us to customize your visit to our Web site by recognizing you when you return. You can choose to decline cookies while at our Web site, however, this may limit your ability to access certain areas of the Web site. Most browsers accept and maintain cookies by default. Check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preference.</p>
<p>When we track activity on our Web site, we collect information such as your IP address, browser type and version, and pages you view. We also keep track of how you got to our site and any links you click on to leave our site. Once you leave our site, we do not track you. We use your Web site activity to assist us in offering you a personalized Web experience, assist you with technical support and to tailor our offerings to you. Remember, you control whether you receive Intuit promotional materials.</p>
<p>We may access and set cookies using Web beacons, also known as single-pixel GIFs which are invisible graphical images. These Web beacons tell us useful information regarding our site such as which pages users access. When we send you e-mails, we may include a single-pixel GIF to determine the number of people who open our e-mails. When you click on a link in an e-mail, we record this individual response to allow us to customize our offerings to you.</p>
<p>Advertising networks that serve ads on our Web site may assign a different cookie to you. The information collected is anonymous and is not linked to your personal information. These cookies may be used to select which ads you see and determine the effectiveness of this advertising. You may choose to decline cookies from third-party ad servers, which Intuit does not control. If you would like to know more about this practice and your choices about not having this information used by third-party ad servers, please <a href="#thirdparty">click here</a>. To provide you with a seamless experience, we may occasionally use framing. Though your browser may indicate you are at www.quickbase.com, you may be on a partner's site. To determine which site you are on, right-click on the page and then select "properties.” Mac users should press the control key, and click their mouse on the site and then look at "View Source."</p>

<h2><a name="thirdparty">Third Parties</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, we enter into contracts with third parties who assist us in servicing you such as filling customer orders or providing customer service. The contracts outline the appropriate use and handling of your information and prohibit third parties from using any of your personal information for purposes unrelated to the product or service for which they’ve been contracted. Vendors are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them. We may disclose or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under the law. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, to comply with a legal process such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or a law enforcement request. We have business partners that provide services, some of which are co-branded. Partner services and sites are clearly identified. When you request any of these products or services, you are permitting us to provide your personal information to the partner to fulfill your request. This Web site may provide links to third-party sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. Because Intuit does not control the information policies or practices of these third parties, you should review their privacy policies to learn more about how they collect and use personal information.</p>

<h2>Additional QuickBase Feature-Specific Information</h2>

<h3>QuickBase Registration</h3>
<p>When you register for a QuickBase account, you are required to provide certain personal and demographic information in order to set up your account. We also request optional demographic information (which helps us understand our QuickBase customers).</p>
<p>If you use our blog on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in this forum.</p>

<h3>QuickBase and Healthcare Information</h3>
<p>QuickBase, related Services, and Content are not "HIPAA-ready" or "HIPAA-compliant" and will not assist with or ensure compliance with HIPAA. You are solely responsible for using QuickBase, related Services and Content in a manner consistent with all applicable federal and state privacy laws relating to medical or health information. </p>

<h3>QuickBase Billing</h3>
<p>When you subscribe to a level of QuickBase service requiring a fee, we require that you provide your billing address and your credit card information, including credit card number and expiration date. Credit card information is used solely for the purpose of billing you for QuickBase service. Credit card and purchase order information is not shared with third parties except as required to process payments.</p>
<p>Your QuickBase service is billed to an account. QuickBase recognizes the account in which your data lives as the owner of your data. The account is responsible for payment and can transfer ownership of your data. Account owners and administrators should keep in mind that if they grant another individual full administrative rights to their account, that person will have access to the account's billing information.</p>

<h3>QuickBase Database Access</h3>
<p>Any content you place in a QuickBase database will not be publicly available unless you voluntarily choose to give permission to other QuickBase users, to QuickBase groups, or to the general public for that database. Intuit personnel will not view, use, or distribute the content of any of your databases without your prior permission or the express permission of the database owner, except as stated under "Legal Disclosures."</p>
<p>You have control over who has access to the data in your databases. When you first create a database, only you have access. At your discretion, you may choose to allow others access to your database. You decide who gets access and at what level (view, modify and/or create).</p>
<p>Your database information is password protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Intuit personnel will not require you to divulge your password, even to provide support or assistance. Remember to sign out of your QuickBase account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to prevent others from accessing your databases if you share a computer with someone else, or are using a computer in a public place, like a library or Internet café.</p>

<h3>QuickBase Accounts</h3>
<p>QuickBase billing accounts allow access and control over database information dependent upon the roles assigned to specific members of the account.</p>
<p>A billing account administrator can delete your application without your permission. However, the billing account administrator will not have privileges to view or alter the data unless you grant such access. QuickBase users in the same e-mail domain will be able to see each other's e-mail addresses in addition to their QuickBase screen names. This increases your ability to correctly identify a QuickBase user within your company, which is helpful when granting access permissions. Billing account administrators can also deny any user access to the entire account. If an account owns the e-mail address tied to a user account, a billing account administrator can completely deactivate that  user's QuickBase account. Please exercise caution when assigning billing account administration rights.</p>

<h3>QuickBase Developer Program</h3>
<p>When you apply for the QuickBase Developer Program, you are required to provide your company's address, contact information, and tax ID (or social security number) in order for QuickBase to contact you regarding the QuickBase Developer program and to properly process payments.</p>

<h3>Other things we want you to know</h3>
<p>Should we sell, merge or transfer any part of our business, part of the sale may include your personal information. If so, you will have the opportunity to ask not to receive promotional information following any change of control.</p>
<p>We may use sources outside of Intuit to supplement the information you give us. For example, we may validate your address using other sources. We use this data to help us maintain accuracy and provide you with better service.</p>
<p>QuickBase is a division of Intuit Inc. Intuit and its divisions may exchange customer data to fulfill your requests or to provide you with information about other products or services. We offer you the opportunity to review privacy practices at our divisions' Web sites; please visit Intuit.com for additional information.</p>
<p>Intuit QuickBase complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Intuit QuickBase has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.
