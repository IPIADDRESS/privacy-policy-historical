<!-- 1/16/04, released a completely rewritten version of this privacy statement, written less technically using plainer language. -->

<!-- On September 23, we updated the E-Mail Message Formatting section of this privacy statement. This update pertains to those who demonstrate interest in our e-mail offers by clicking on a link within the e-mail. We will note your interest when you click on the e-mail link. This information helps us provide more tailored offerings to you, and is not shared outside Intuit. The full text of this update is available <a href="#e-mail_messaging">here</a>.<br>  -->

	At Intuit QuickBase, we respect and protect the privacy of our customers. This Privacy Statement is intended to provide you with information about our online data handling practices and our approach to privacy.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBoldBlue">We tell you how we intend to use your information.</span><br>
	When we ask you for information, we will tell you, or it will be clear, what we need to fulfill your request and how it will be used. While visiting our site, you have the opportunity to learn more about our products, services and programs. We may ask you for demographic and firmagraphic information to facilitate your request and to keep you informed of Intuit products and services that are valuable to your business. <br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBoldBlue">We protect your information.</span><br>
	We protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information by using industry-recognized security safeguards, such as firewalls, coupled with carefully developed security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration. When we ask for sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, we encrypt it as it is transmitted to us.<br>
<br>
	Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information and, by using physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, we restrict access to personal information to those employees and agents for business purposes only. Additionally, we use internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security procedures.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBoldBlue">We do not sell or rent your personal information to anyone.</span><br>
	We do not share your personal information with third parties for their independent promotional use. <br>
<br>
	<span class="contentBoldBlue">We have limited relationships with third parties.</span><br>
	Sometimes, we enter into contracts with third parties so that they can assist us in servicing you (for example, fulfilling customer orders or providing customer service). The contracts prohibit them from using any of your personal information for their own purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them. We may disclose or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under the law. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, to comply with a legal process such as court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request.<br>
<br>
	We may also enter into "joint marketing" relationships with carefully selected partners who offer products or services that may be of interest to you. When we do, they are prohibited from using any of your personal information for anything outside the joint venture, unless you choose to give them your information or become their customer. Our contracts with them protect the confidentiality of the limited information we share with them.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBoldBlue">You control what marketing information you receive from us.</span><br>
	From time to time, we may send you promotional information about QuickBase products and services. If you do not want to receive this type of information about QuickBase products and services, you may specify your preferences at <a href="https://www.quickbase.com/db/9gc8fpum?a=GenNewRecord" target="_new" class="contentLinks">https://www.quickbase.com/db/9gc8fpum?a=GenNewRecord</a>. When you decide to decline promotional materials, you will still receive service communications, legally mandated notices, and critical messages that could impact your business and usage of the product.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBoldBlue">You can change your information.</span><br>
	You can update or correct your contact information anytime by sending an e-mail to: <a href="mailto: privacy@quickbase.com">privacy@quickbase.com</a>.<br>
<br>
	<span class="contentBoldBlue">You can contact us with privacy questions.</span><br>
	At QuickBase, we do what we say and say what we do. If you have privacy-related questions that are not addressed here, please contact the Privacy Team at <a href="https://privacy.intuit.com/cpi/do/comments" target="_new" class="contentLinks"> https://privacy.intuit.com/cpi/do/comments</a> or write us at:<br>

	<span class="contentBoldBlue">We do not ask children for information.</span><br>
	Because of the financial nature of our business, our Web sites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly request or receive any information from children.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBoldBlue">We tell you about Web technologies.</span><br>
	We use a variety of technologies on our Web site. Among these are "cookies"; a piece of information that our Web sites provide to your browser when you visit our sites. Cookies allow us to track overall site usage and determine areas users prefer. Cookies also allow us to make your visit to our Web site easier by recognizing you when you return and helping to provide you with a customized experience. You can choose to decline cookies while at our Web site; however, this may limit your ability to access certain areas of the Web site. Most browsers accept and maintain cookies by default. Check the Help menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.<br>
<br>
	We also keep track of activity on our Web site. We collect information such as IP address, browser type and version, and pages you view. We also keep track of how you got to our site and any links you click to leave our site. Once you leave our site, we do not track you. We use your Web site activity to assist us in offering you a personalized Web experience, assist you with technical support and to tailor our offerings to you.<br>
<br>
	We may access and set cookies using Web beacons, also known as single-pixel GIFs, which are invisible graphical images. These Web beacons provide us with useful information regarding our site such as which pages users access. When we send you e-mails, we may include a single-pixel GIF to allow us to determine the number of people who open our e-mails. When you click a link in an e-mail, we record this individual response to allow us to customize our offerings to you.<br>
<br>
	To provide you with a seamless experience, we may occasionally use framing. Though your browser may indicate you are at QuickBase.com, you may be on a partner's site. To determine which site you are on, right-click on the site and then select "Properties." <br>
<br>
	We may also gather usage information; including IP address, browser type and version, pages viewed, and pages linked to and off our site. We may use this data to better understand Web site and product performance, activity, and utilization in order to continuously improve our offerings. We may also use this data to provide you with a more personalized Web site experience, assist you with technical support questions, and to send you special offers, product and service updates, or other promotional materials that are relevant to your business. We do not track URLs that you type into your browser, nor do we track you across the Internet once you leave our site.<br>
<br>
	<span class="contentBoldBlue">Additional QuickBase Feature-Specific Information</span><br>
<br>
	<span class="contentBold">QuickBase Registration</span><br>
	When you register for a QuickBase account, you are required to provide certain personal and demographic information in order to set up your account. We also request optional demographic information (which helps us understand our QuickBase customers).<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">QuickBase and Healthcare Information</span><br>
	QuickBase, related Services, and Content are not "HIPAA-ready" or "HIPAA-compliant" and will not assist with or ensure compliance with HIPAA. You are solely responsible for using QuickBase, related Services and Content in a manner consistent with all applicable federal and state privacy laws relating to medical or health information.
	<br><br>
	<span class="contentBold">QuickBase Billing</span><br>
	When you subscribe to a level of QuickBase service requiring a fee, we require that you provide your billing address and your credit card information, including credit card number and expiration date. Credit card information is used solely for the purpose of billing you for QuickBase service. Credit card and purchase order information is not shared with third parties except as required to process payments.<br>
<br>
	For your convenience, we give you the option of billing your QuickBase service to a "workgroup." If you choose to join a workgroup for billing purposes, ownership of your QuickBase data will be transferred to that workgroup. The workgroup owner is responsible for payment and can transfer ownership of your data. Workgroup owners and administrators should keep in mind that all other workgroup administrators will have access to the workgroup's billing information.<br>
<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">QuickBase Database Access</span><br>
	Any content you place in a QuickBase database will not be publicly available unless you voluntarily choose to give permission to other QuickBase users, to QuickBase groups, or to the general public for that database. Intuit personnel will not view, use, or distribute the content of any of your databases without your prior permission or the express permission of the database owner, except as stated under "Legal Disclosures."<br>
<br>
	You have control over who has access to the data in your databases. When you first create a database, only you have access. At your discretion, you may choose to allow others access to your database. You decide who gets access and at what level (view, modify and/or create).<br>
<br>
	Your database information is password protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Intuit personnel will not require you to divulge your password, even to provide support or assistance. Remember to sign out of your QuickBase account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to prevent others from accessing your databases if you share a computer with someone else, or are using a computer in a public place, like a library or Internet café.<br>
<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">QuickBase Workgroups</span><br>
	QuickBase workgroups allow access and control over database information dependent upon the roles assigned to specific members of the workgroup.<br>
<br>
	A workgroup owner can delete your data without your permission. However, the workgroup owner will not have privileges to view or alter the data unless you grant such access. Workgroup members will be able to see each other's e-mail addresses in addition to their QuickBase screen names. This will increase your ability to correctly identify a QuickBase user within your workgroup, which is helpful when granting access permissions. Workgroup administrators will also be able to deactivate a workgroup member's user account. Please exercise caution when assigning workgroup administration rights.<br>
<br>
	<span class="contentBold">QuickBase Developer Program</span><br>
	When you apply for the QuickBase Developer Program, you are required to provide your company's address, contact information, and tax ID (or social security number) in order for QuickBase to contact you regarding the QuickBase Developer program and to properly process payments.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBoldBlue">Other things we want you to know.</span><br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">Transmission of Information Outside of Your Country</span><br>
	If you are located outside the U.S., your personally identifiable information and database(s) may be stored and processed outside of the country of which you are a citizen and/or in which you reside. By using QuickBase, you consent to the transmission of your personally identifiable information outside of your country so that it may be used for purposes consistent with those specified in this Privacy Statement and in the "Terms of Services." If you are within the European Economic Area, you should be aware that such extra-territorial transmissions may be to countries outside of the European Economic Area which may have different data protection laws. When this occurs, Intuit shall take appropriate steps to protect the information transmitted.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">Legal Disclosures</span><br>
	In some cases, we may disclose certain information (including, when applicable, your personally identifiable information) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">Mergers and Acquisitions</span><br>
	Should we sell, merge or transfer any part of our business, part of the sale may include your personally identifiable information. If so, you will have the opportunity to ask not to receive promotional information following any change of control.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">Policy and Statement Changes</span><br>
	If we make any significant changes to our privacy policies or practices, we will let you know 30 days in advance.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">Information from Other Sources</span><br>
	We may use other sources to supplement the information you give us. For example, we may validate your address using other sources. We use this data to help us maintain accuracy and provide you with better service.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">Intuit Division Processes</span><br>
	QuickBase is a division of Intuit Inc. Intuit and its division may exchange customer data to fulfill your requests or to provide you with information about other products or services. We offer you the opportunity to review privacy practices at our divisions' Web sites; please visit Intuit.com for additional information.<br>
