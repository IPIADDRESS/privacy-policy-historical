        that we use the information collected online at this Website.
    </p>
    <p>
        We collect your personally identifiable information when you sign up to receive
        products and/or services at the Website. We may also collect your personally identifiable

        by submitting that information to us, you grant to us the right to use your personal
        information for any legal purpose including, without limitation:

    <p>
        You agree that we may contact you at any time with updates and/or any other information
        that we may deem appropriate for you to receive in connection with your continued
        use of the Website. We also reserve the right to release current or past member
        information in the event that we believe that this Website is being or has been

        acquired or when we otherwise deem it necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, you agree that by submitting your personal information at the Website,
        such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application for purposes of
        the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR §310 et seq. (the "ATSR"). Notwithstanding
        that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call
        List, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the
        ATSR. Moreover, by registering with, making a purchase from, or requesting information

        We may share with third party advertisers certain Website usage information of individuals
        that have received targeted promotional campaigns for the purpose of formatting
        future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics.
        For this purpose, we may track some of the pages that you visit on our Website through
        the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). By submitting information at and/or
        registering at this Website, you agree to allow us to share such Website usage information
        with third parties.
    </p>
    <h2>Third Party Links</h2>
    <p>
        We do not endorse, nor are we responsible for the accuracy of, the privacy policies
        and/or terms and conditions of each of the third party advertisers that may advertise
        at this Website. The entities that advertise and/or place banner ads at this Website
        including, but not limited to, these third party advertisers, are independent third
        parties and are not affiliated with us.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>
        During registration and/or when you submit personally identifiable information to
        us at the Website, you have opted-in to request that we share your personal information
        with third parties to receive marketing communications. However, your email address
        will only be shared with our mailing partner, ExpressSender.com. When contacted
        by any of these companies or third parties, you should notify them directly of your
        choices regarding their use and sharing of your information. To opt-out from receiving

        standard rates apply to these messages. To unsubscribe or discontinue SMS messages,
        send "STOP", "END", "QUIT" to the SMS text message you have received. This process
        impacts only the future delivery of the particular SMS message offering, so you

        behalf of third parties.<br>

        be provided to you. To trigger these cookies, we may pass an encrypted or “hashed”
        (non-human readable) identifier corresponding to your email address to a Web advertising
        partner, who may place a cookie on your computer. No personally identifiable information
        is on, or is connected to, these cookies. To opt-out of these cookies, please go

        notifications connected with the work of this service. As being registered you agree
        to get such kind of SMS messages and also promotional SMS messages on the cell number
        you've entered while registration. You understand that your wireless carrier's rates
        may apply to these messages. If you would like to stop receiving our our services

        message you have received.

        <br>
        We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the
        design and content of our Website and to enable us to personalize your Internet
        experience. We also may use this information to analyze Website usage, as well as
