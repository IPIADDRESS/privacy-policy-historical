These Services also include optional services for safe navigation and search. The purpose is to enable you to control the use of these devices by their Users (as defined below), when and to the extent that such activity is permitted by applicable law and without infringing the rights of others (including the fundamental rights of Users) or other applicable regulations. </p>
<p>We are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy and that of your Users (as defined in the Qustodio Terms of Service). This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the use of personal data collected and processed through our Services (as defined in the Qustodio Terms of Service, of which this Privacy Policy is a part). </p>

<p>You warrant that (a) you have informed any Users that are 14 years old or more that the Devices used by them include a control and monitoring software and have obtained authorisation from such Users for this kind of activity, as provided in this Privacy Policy or (b) there are rules in your country that exempt you from the aforementioned obligation of information and consent, or provides for a different age limit, in which case that age limit will apply. Both Qustodio and you agree to fully comply with this Privacy Policy.</p>

It is also used to measure and improve the services and functionality and to provide customer service, send email notifications and (unless no longer in the distribution list) newsletters, or communications, in general, about the Services, products and novelties, and product offers or promotions offered by Us.

<p><strong>Service optimisation.</strong> We may process such information on an aggregated non-identifiable basis for establishing user general attributes and profiles and share such anonymous information with third party service providers to help improve or promote our service. We also use your data in a non-identifying and aggregated manner (i.e. dissociated data) to better design our web site, software and services.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure.</strong> We treat your Account Data with strict confidentiality in accordance with applicable law. However, we shall disclose any information about you or your use of our Services (i) in compliance with a legal obligation, (ii) in order to correctly deliver our Services or perform other obligations in accordance to the applicable regulations and rules set forth in the Terms, (iii) in the event of a sale of change of control of the Company for the purpose of appropriate due diligence; or (iv) to service providers providing us a service in relation to the data. We require all third parties to respect the security of your Account Data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your Account Data data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. </p>
<p><strong>Lawful Bases.</strong> Below are the lawful bases that we rely on to process your Account Data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance of Contract:</strong> processing your data is necessary for the performance of our contract with you, or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Legitimate Interest:</strong> we have a legitimate interest to process your Account data for our business, in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us at info@qustodio.com. </p>
</li>
<li>

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. <em><strong>Generally speaking, we will retain your Account Data for the period of your subscription (active) and 7 years thereafter (blocked), for legal and administrative purposes.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Statistical use.</strong> We may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use and retain this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<h2>3. Processing of User Data on your behalf: the Company as data processor</h2>
<p><strong>User Data.</strong> In registering for a Qustodio Account, the Services start collecting data from the Devices associated to the Account, which may include personal data relating to you, to the Users of the Devices or to third parties (“<em><strong>User Data</strong></em>”, including information about your Devices, websites and apps that your Users use, contacts, connections, payments, messages and other communications, posted and received content, etc.).

<h2>4. International transfers of data</h2>
<p>We use third party technological services for the provision of Services, whose providers may process Account Data and User Data collected in the course of providing us their services indicated below, as sub-processors. These entities may be in jurisdictions that generally don’t provide adequate safeguards in relation to the processing of personal data. However, we have entered into contracts with such entities that do include such safeguards, including the EC model clauses. For more information, please contact info@qustodio.com. In addition, our providers which are in the USA are companies within the EU-US Privacy Shield. </p>
<h2>5. Data Security</h2>
<p>We have adopted technical and organizational measures to preserve and protect your personal information from unauthorized use or access and from being altered, lost or misused, taking into account the technological state of art, the features of the information stored and the risks to which information is exposed.  However, due to the nature of the information and related technology, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of your personal information and expressly disclaims any such obligation. If we learn of a security breach, then we will attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate steps.</p>
<h2>6. Analytics and other anonymous data use</h2>
<p>For the purpose of improving our services and providing sector/segment reports, we anonymise your Account Data and certain generic User Data and store and process this data on an anonymous basis, even after your Account has been closed. The principal purpose is to analyze on an aggregated non-identifiable basis how our Services are used, measuring their effectiveness, and providing general customer service. We may also provide this data (or parts of it) on a fully anonymous aggregate basis to third party business partners, including for conducting academic research and surveys or commercial analytics, and to publish periodic sector or segmented information and reports about behaviour patterns and tendencies.</p>
<h2>7. User Rights</h2>
<p><strong>Account Data:</strong> you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal Account Data. You have the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p>To exercise your rights, please contact us at info@qustodio.com or at Passeig de Gracia 18 Planta 2, Barcelona, Spain. </p>
<p>You may address a complaint about the processing personal data to our supervisory authority which is the Spanish Data Protection Agency, at www.agpd.es.  </p>
<p><strong>User Data:</strong> You are Data Controller of your User Data, and you can access, delete, restrict, correct and request a copy of your data at any time. We will assist you in accordance with the functionalities of the Platform and the term of this agreement to attend any end-user request with regard to the processing of their personal data, as provided in Annex 1 hereto. </p>
<h2>8. Commercial Communications.</h2>
<p>An integral part of our service involves informing you of new options, configurations and service offerings. On registration or contacting us, you expressly consent to receive electronic commercial communications regarding the subject matter of the Services in accordance with applicable law, including alerts, notices, newsletters, offers and promotions. Once opted in, if afterwards you do not wish to receive information from this Platform you can expressly opt out by sending a notification to info@qustodio.com.</p>
<h2>9. Consent</h2>
<p>Although we have a legal basis other than consent for the processing of the data set out in this form (other than marketing communications), we also would like to ensure that we additionally have your express consent. </p>
<p>By completing the forms of the Qustodio Platform and registering for an Account, you declare to have read and accepted the terms of this Policy. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, you expressly and unequivocally consent to: </p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Your consent to personal data collection and processing may be revoked, without retroactive effects, in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation. This will not prevent processing of your Account Data for providing you the service, unless you also cancel your account with us.</strong></p>
<h1>Annex 1 – Processing of User Data</h1>
<p>We process User Data under instruction from you (the client) as “Data Controller”. This means that you are in control of this data: you determine which data is collected, and how it is used for your parental control purposes.
