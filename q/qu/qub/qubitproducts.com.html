			<h1><a href="http://www.qubitproducts.com/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></h1>

			
			<div class="entry">
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Effective Date: Jun 20, 2010.</h2>
<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At QuBit we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<p>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</p>
<p>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</p>
<p>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</p>
<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>
<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team at info@qubitproducts.com</p>
<p>QuBit Digital Ltd (“QuBit”) operates several websites including opentag.qubitproducts.com, It is QuBit’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
<p>Like most web service operators, QuBit collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. QuBit’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how QuBit’s visitors use its website. From time to time, QuBit may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>QuBit also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. QuBit only discloses logged in user information under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below:</p>
<p>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</p>
<p>Certain visitors to QuBit’s websites choose to interact with QuBit in ways that require QuBit to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that QuBit gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. QuBit collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with QuBit. QuBit does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<p>Aggregated Statistics</p>
<p>QuBit may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. QuBit may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, QuBit does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>QuBit discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on QuBit’s behalf or to provide services available at QuBit’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using QuBit’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. QuBit will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, QuBit discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when QuBit believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of QuBit, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an QuBit website and have supplied your email address, QuBit may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with QuBit and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. QuBit takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

QuBit visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using QuBit’s websites&nbsp;or choose to disable Cookies by clicking on the disable cookies icon at the bottom of this screen, with the drawback that certain features of QuBit’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
