			<h2>HOW WE USE INFORMATION – Details</h2>

			<h3>Cookies</h3>
			<p>Our websites use cookies in various places. Cookies are pieces of information in the form of small text files that are placed on your computer and saved by your browser. They are used to improve our services and make them more user-friendly, effective and secure. Also, cookies enable our systems to identify your browser and offer you our services. Cookies do not contain any personal data.</p>
			
			<h3>Use of the Google Inc. remarketing or "Similar Audiences" function</h3>
			<p>The provider uses the Google Inc. ("Google") remarketing or "Similar Audiences" function on the website. The provider can use this function to address visitors to the website with targeted advertising, by switching on display advertising related to the interests of users of the provider's website when they visit other websites in the Google Display Network. Google uses cookies to run an analysis of website usage, which forms the basis for generating interest-related display advertising. Google does so by storing a small file with a sequence of numbers in the browsers of visitors to the website. This number is used to capture visits to the website and anonymous data on the use of the website. No personal data regarding visitors to the website is stored. If you subsequently visit another website on the Google Display Network, you are shown advertising displays that most probably concern product and information areas previously visited.</p>
			<p>You can permanently disable the use of cookies by Google by following the link below and downloading and installing the plug-in provided: <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996</a></p>
			<p>Alternatively, you can disable the use of cookies by third-party providers by going to the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page at <a target="_blank" href="www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a> and implementing the additional information given there on opting out.</p>
			<p>You can find additional information on Google remarketing and the Google data protection declaration at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></p>

			<h3>Use of Google Adwords Conversion Tracking</h3>
			<p>We use the Google AdWords online advertising program and Conversion Tracking as part of Google AdWords. Google Conversion Tracking is an analysis service offered by Google Inc. </p>
			<p>If you click on advertising switched on by Google, a Conversion Tracking cookie is deposited on your computer. These cookies have restricted validity, do not contain personal data and therefore are not used for identifying individuals.</p>
			<p>If you visit certain pages on our website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we can detect that you have clicked on the advert and been forwarded to this page.</p>
			<p>Every Google AdWords customer has a different cookie. Hence there is no possibility of cookies being traced back via the websites of AdWords customers.</p>
			<p>The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers that are critical for conversion tracking. In this way, the customers learn the total number of users that have clicked on the advert and have been forwarded to a page provided with a Conversion Tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that can be used for personally identifying users.</p>
			<p>If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can retract your consent for this usage by preventing the installation of cookies via a corresponding setting in your browser software (disabling option). You will then be excluded from the Conversion Tracking statistics.</p>
			<p>You can find additional information and the Google data protection declaration at <a target="_blank" href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

			<h3>Use of Google Analytics</h3>
			<p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service offered by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies – text files that are stored on your computer and enable analysis of the way you are using the website.

However, if IP anonymization has been enabled on this website, your IP address is first abbreviated by Google within member states of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. The full IP address is only transferred to a Google server in the USA and abbreviated there in exceptional cases. At the request of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to analyze your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide additional services connected with the use of the website and the Internet on the part of the website operator. The IP address communicated by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data. You can block the storage of cookies using an appropriate setting in your browser software. However, we advise you that, if you do so, you may not be able to use all the functions on this website to their full extent. Furthermore, you can prevent the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) from being captured and processed by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in provided in the following link <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.</p>

			<h3>Use of Facebook plug-ins</h3>
			<p>Plug-ins for the social network facebook.com are used on this website. These are operated by Facebook Inc.("Facebook").</p>
			<p>If you access pages on our website provided with such a plug-in, a connection with the Facebook servers will be established and the plug-in displayed on the web page by communicating with your browser. In this way information is sent to the Facebook servers on which of our web pages you have visited. If you are logged into Facebook when this happens, Facebook will allocate this information to your personal Facebook user account. If you use the plug-in functions (e.g. click on the "Like" button, post a comment), this information is also allocated to your Facebook account. You can only prevent this by logging out before using the plug-in.</p>
			<p>You can find more information on how Facebook acquires and uses data, your rights in this matter and the options for protecting your privacy in the Facebook data protection information.</p>

			<h3>Use of Facebook Pixel</h3>
			<p>Our website measures conversions using visitor action pixels from Facebook.</p>
			<p>These allow the behavior of site visitors to be tracked after they click on a Facebook ad to reach the provider's website. This allows an analysis of the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes and their future optimization.</p>
			<p>The data collected is anonymous to us as operators of this website and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users' identities. However, the data are stored and processed by Facebook, which may make a connection to your Facebook profile and which may use the data for its own advertising purposes, as stipulated in the Facebook privacy policy.

			<h3>Use of the Google +1 button</h3>
			<p>The +1 button for the Google Plus social network operated by Google Inc is used on these web pages. If you access a page on our website bearing the +1 button, a connection with the Google servers in the USA will be established and the button will be displayed on the web page by communicating with your browser. In doing so, your IP address and information on which of our web pages you have visited are submitted to the Google servers. This is regardless of whether you have registered or logged in with Google Plus. Submission takes place even with users who are not registered or logged in. The +1 button is not used to capture information on where you go on the Internet. Google does not permanently log your browser behavior when a +1 button is displayed and does not analyze your visit to a page with a +1 button in any other way. Google stores data concerning your visit for around 14 days for system maintenance and error removal purposes. However, this data is not structured according to individual profiles, user names or URLs and is also not forwarded to us.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, if you are a member of Google Plus and are logged in to Google Plus during the time you are using the plug-in, the information acquired regarding your visit to website is linked to your Google Plus account and disclosed to other users.

You can find an overview of the various types of Google plug-ins here: <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/+/web/">https://developers.google.com/+/web/</a></p>
			<p>If you have made your profile publicly accessible in the Google Plus settings, your +1 may be displayed by Google as information, together with your profile name and photo, in Google services such as search results, or in your Google profile, or in other locations on websites and in display advertisements on the Internet. If you do not want Google to allocate the data acquired directly to your Google Plus profile, you will need to log out of Google Plus before visiting our site.</p>
