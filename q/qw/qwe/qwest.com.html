<p><b>Customer Privacy Policy</b><br>
<br>
<b>REVISED October 10, 2001</b><br>
<br>
Like you, we at Qwest are concerned about customer privacy. We have a long history 
of maintaining the privacy of information we obtain in the normal course of providing 
our services. We work hard to serve you through new and exciting products and 
services. In the process, we remain sensitive to privacy issues.<br>
<br>
<b>The Information We Obtain and How We Use It</b><br>
<br>
The information we obtain from you is generally necessary for us to provide your 
services and design new services for your future use. For example, we need to 
know your name, address and the services you buy from us to properly provide and 
bill for those services. When you call us, our representatives pull up account 
records and may refer to your bill, your calling patterns, and other information 
we have to answer questions you may have or recommend how we can best serve you.<br>
<br>
We may also use information in our records to protect our customers, employees 
or property - for instance, to investigate fraud, harassment or other types of 
unlawful service activities involving Qwest or other carriers that we do business 
with. In some cases, it may be necessary to provide this information to the government 
or third parties who make a lawful demand for it.<br>
<br>
We share information within our Qwest companies to enable us to better understand 
our customers' product and service needs, and to learn how to best design, develop, 
and package products and services to meet those needs. Like any large business, 
we may structure our company to include a number of smaller companies. Currently, 
our primary lines of business include local and long distance services, wireless 
services, cable services, dedicated web hosting, Internet access for businesses 
and consumers, on-line services, and directory publishing. We also offer other 
products and services, for example, Frame Relay, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), 
telephone equipment, voice mail services, and directory advertising.<br>
<br>
<b>Accuracy of the Information We Hold</b><br>
<br>
We want the information we obtain and use about customers to be accurate. If your 
service information or your personal contact information changes or you see an 
inaccuracy on your Qwest bill, let us know so we can correct it.<br>
<br>
<b>Security and Accountability</b><br>
<br>
We have information systems that collect and store customer information in addition 
to systems that store our own business records. These systems have different types 
of security as appropriate for the information stored. Qwest requires employees 
to keep customer information confidential and we hold them accountable for their 
actions.<br>
<br>
<b>Providing Services to Enhance Your Privacy</b><br>
<br>
Non-published numbers, Caller ID and Caller ID blocking services, Anonymous Call 
Rejection, and No Solicitation are among the privacy services Qwest offers to 
enhance your privacy.<br>
<br>
<b>Disclosure of Information Outside Qwest</b><br>
<br>
As a general rule, Qwest does not release customer account information to unaffiliated 
third parties without your permission unless we have a business relationship with 
those companies where the disclosure is appropriate. For example, we may hire 
outside companies as contractors or agents; or we might be engaged in a joint 
venture or partnership with a company. Upon occasion, Qwest may decide to stop 
providing a service or may decide to sell or transfer parts of our business to 
unaffiliated companies. When this happens, we may provide confidential customer 
information to these companies so that they can offer you the same or similar 
services. In all of these situations, we provide information to these other companies 
only as needed to accomplish our business objectives and the companies are bound 
by requirements to keep Qwest customers' information confidential.<br>
<br>
There are exceptions to the general rule. For example, we might provide information 
to regulatory or administrative agencies so that they can accomplish their regulatory 
tasks (for example, responding to a customer complaint) or to maximize the efficiencies 
of our own processes (such as getting mailing addresses correct, for example). 
Other disclosures will be driven by legal requirements imposed on Qwest. Qwest 
complies with "legal process," such as a subpoena or court order or 
other similar demand, associated with either criminal or civil proceedings.<br>
<br>
</p><blockquote>
<b>Disclosure of Account Information</b><br>
<br>
If you tell us in writing to release your account information to someone, we will 
honor your request and provide that information.<br>
<br>
Your account information is released to other carriers when you give us your permission 
or when they advise us they have your approval to access the information. This 
most often occurs with respect to a sale of service they want to make or have 
made to you. Unless we are advised that permission from you has been granted, 
we do not release the information.<br>
<br>
We may provide account information to collection agencies when customers do not 
pay their bills. We restrict the use that can be made of this information to collection 
activities only for our charges and for the charges we bill for others.<br>
<br>
Other carriers use Qwest to bill for their charges. In this case, they provide 
us with information about you, including your calling patterns, and we bill you 
on their behalf. In turn, we provide them with non-sensitive information about 
your service, such as the date your service was established or disconnected; whether 
you have toll or 900 blocking services, whether you have a calling card or not 
and when it was issued, how you pay your bills and if they are paid on time.<br>
<br>
<b>Disclosure of Customer Telephone Numbers, Names and Addresses</b><br>
<br>
Telephone number, name and sometimes address information is "released" 
by Qwest in different ways. It is sometimes released as "lists" to entities 
that are entitled by law to receive the information or which have entered into 
contracts with Qwest to receive it. The information is sometimes released through 
the network "transactionally," such as when your phone number and name 
are released through a Caller ID mechanism. Sometimes the information is provided 
in reports to those persons who are being called by you and want to know more 
about who is calling them and when. Whether a number is recognized as "published" 
or not will generally depend on the medium by which the number is captured and 
released.<br>
<br>
For example, a person can ask Qwest to include them in directories (that is "publish" 
their number) or not. Persons can ask to not be published in directories but included 
in Directory Assistance (non-listed numbers). Or persons can ask not to be either 
in directories or Directory Assistance (non-published). All of these terms refer 
to a "listing" status.<br>
<br>
However, the telephone <b>network</b> does not recognize a number as published/listed 
or non-listed or non-published. Thus, the network will "pass" that number 
to interconnecting carriers (local, long distance, wireless) and to called parties. 
Only if the network (a) has the capability to block the number; and (b) you have 
invoked a blocking mechanism will the called party (but not the carriers in between) 
be unable to see the calling number. And, where both the calling number and name 
are "carried" as part of the network call, generally both will be displayed 
or both will be blocked.<br>
<br>
In some cases, such as on some party- or coin-operated lines, as well as calls 
to pay-per-call (900) or toll-free numbers (such as 800/888/877 numbers), the 
network does not have the capability to block your underlying phone number even 
if you invoke Caller ID blocking. And there may be other services that rely on 
this type of automatic number identification (ANI) technology, such as cable companies 
that offer movies keyed to the automatic delivery of your phone number or pizza 
companies that route your calls to the closest stores based on your number. There 
are a variety of businesses that subscribe to these types of services. By federal 
regulation, however, businesses that utilize this technology can only use it to 
provide you the service in question or one directly related to it. And, because 
federal law requires phone numbers associated with facsimile transmissions to 
be released as part of the facsimile, these phone numbers are not blocked either.<br>
<br>
When you order services from us to connect to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) 
or choose a carrier, we may need to advise them of your telephone number in order 
that they may provide your requested service. This includes non-listed and non-published 
telephone numbers.<br>
<br>
In addition to the above types of disclosures, Qwest is required, by law, to make 
disclosures of customer telephone number, name and address information in certain 
circumstances, including those described below.<br>
<ul>

<li> We are required to provide <b>listed</b> customer names, addresses and 
telephone numbers to directory publishers - our own and others. Qwest and other 
directory publishers may publish this information in alphabetical or reverse directories 
that take the form of paper directories, electronic directories over the Internet, 
or on CDs. We also provide customer name and addresses for all customers (including 
non-listed and non-published customers) to directory publishers to allow for directory 
deliveries, but only for that purpose.<br>
<br>
</li><li> We are required to provide customer names, addresses and telephone numbers to directory assistance and operator services providers.  This information includes non-listed information, as well as the name and address of non-published customers. By contract, Qwest requests these companies to honor the privacy indicators that may be included in their purchased lists and such indicators are included for nonlisted and nonpublished numbers.  Some of these providers offer Internet or online directory assistance services.<br>
<br>
</li><li> In some cases, when you dial 911, your name, address and telephone number information is provided to the emergency service provider.  And, by law, we are required to provide this information, including non-listed and non-published information, to emergency service providers and emergency support services providers upon request in a more comprehensive format.<br>
<br>
</li><li> If you place a long distance call using a provider other than the one you use on your home phone -- for example, if you place a calling card or third number billed call from a pay phone - Qwest is required by law to provide billing name and address information to the service provider.  This includes names and addresses associated with non-published and non-listed information where the individual has not objected.  This information cannot be used for marketing purposes.  Similar information is provided with respect to the provision of services by non-Qwest carriers.
</li></ul>


We might provide your name and address to administrative agencies where we are 
working with them to minimize costs and maximize accuracy. For example, we might 
share this information with the Post Office so that we continue to get reduced 
postage rates and you get your bills and other information from us in a cost-efficient, 
reliable and timely fashion.<br>
<br>
We also compile lists of customer names, addresses and telephone numbers of the 
type printed in the White Pages directories and provide these lists to qualified 
companies that are conducting product promotions. Non-published and non-listed 
numbers are not included in these lists and we remove other customers from these 
lists by request.<br>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Your Control Over the Disclosure of Information</b> <br>
<br>
You tell us the telephone listings you want to include in our directories and 
in directory assistance. You also may choose to have a non-published or non-listed 
number, or to exclude your address from your listing.<br>
<br>
As we addressed above, in certain cases you can block the transmission of your 
telephone number (and name) to those persons you call.<br>
<br>
Our Qwest divisions may provide you with information about new products and services 
or special promotions. However, Qwest does maintain an internal "Do Not Call" 
list in line with federal law. If you ask not to be contacted, the business or 
division that is calling you will put your telephone number on a list. Other Qwest 
business divisions will still be able to call you unless you make it clear that 
you do not want to be contacted by any Qwest business unit. Some states have adopted 
their own "Do Not Call" laws, which are usually managed by a third party 
database administer. Often those laws permit continued contact with persons whose 
numbers are on the list when there is an existing business relationship, so you 
might get a call from us even if you are on these kinds of lists.<br>
<br>
It is Qwest's practice to stop sending direct mail materials to individuals that 
request it not be sent. There are no laws that control this accommodation but 
we respect the desire of individuals to be free of such communications if they 
wish.<br>
<br>
Qwest or its business partners may use e-mail to communicate with customers about 
events or new products and services or to respond to visitor's e-mails. Our residential 
local telephone service customers may visit our qwest.com web site, Email Contact 
Preferences page to add or remove themselves from our email list. If you receive 
unwanted email from us you may also remove yourself from our email list by simply 
following the "unsubscribe" instructions in the email. We will not send commercial 
solicitations to customers who request it not be sent. Please note that if you 
do go through this process, some e-mail messages may still come to you, although 
not those dealing with commercial solicitations. For example, we may e-mail you

We honor customer requests to have their names removed from lists that Qwest might 
provide to firms desiring to do product promotions. Customers with non-listed 
and non-published numbers are not included on the lists. For individuals with 
listed information, if you do not wish to have your name included on such lists, 
just tell us and we will remove your name at no charge.<br>

<b>Privacy Over the Internet</b><br>
<br>
Qwest appreciates that some individuals believe that special privacy concerns 
arise around information transmitted or collected over the Internet or through 
web sites. Below we describe our practices to address those concerns.<br>
<br>
<b>Cookies:</b> Some of Qwest's Web sites may use "cookies" to improve 
our level of service and speed up the delivery of information to our visitors. 
Cookies are lines of text that are transmitted to your Web browser when you click 
on a site. They provide a way for a server to recall a previous request or previous 
registration, or to keep track of a transaction as it progresses, so that information 
does not have to be repeated. Your browser stores the information on your hard 
drive and when you return to that site later, the cookie is transmitted back only 
to the servers that originally sent it to you. To be notified when you are about 
to receive a cookie you can configure your browser to alert you when a site is 
attempting to send you a cookie and at that time you will have the option of refusing 
the cookie. You can check your hard drive for cookie files in a "cookies" 
folder for Internet Explorer, a "cookies.txt" file for Netscape, and 
under "magic cookies" on a Macintosh.<br>
<br>
Advertisers that serve ads on our Web sites may also use their own cookies. These 
cookies collect their own information independent of Qwest. You can disable this 
cookie capability as described above.<br>
<br>
<b>How online information Qwest collects is used:</b> Generic Information -- To 
gauge the effectiveness of our Web sites, we do collect some non-individually-identifiable 
generic information about our visitors. Our Web servers automatically recognize 
a visitor's Internet service provider, the IP address, the domain name, the type 
of browser, and the operating system. And, also which pages are viewed on our 
sites, the Web page you were on when you link to our sites, how much time a visitor 
spends on each page and other information related to the operation and interaction 
of Qwest Web sites. This information does not reveal a visitor's identity. We 
aggregate this information and use it to evaluate and improve our Web sites.<br>
<br>
Identifiable Information -- You can choose to provide individually-identifiable 
information to Qwest in a number of ways through our Web sites - by ordering a 
service from us, sending us email, registering to receive news or information, 
applying for a job, or entering a contest. When visitors supply information about 
themselves for a specific purpose, Qwest uses the information for that purpose 
(such as to provide the information the visitor has requested or to consider a 
visitor for a particular job). In addition, when visitors use our Web sites to 
order services, or to request information about our services, we may use the individually-identifiable 
information as we would use the same information obtained off-line - for example, 
to evaluate your service needs and contact you regarding additional services you 
may find useful.<br>
<br>
Sometimes Qwest co-sponsors events with another company, such as contests or features. 
In that case, if you provide individually-identifiable information it most likely 
will be used by both Qwest and the co-sponsor.<br>
<br>
A user may choose to provide us individually-identifiable information to customize 
a personal home page. We use this information to better understand and serve our 
customers, but we do not share that information outside of Qwest. This information 
may be compiled on an aggregated basis and shared with our advertisers or business 
partners but the user will be anonymous.<br>
<br>
For our Qwest.net and Choice Online customers - as part of our ongoing efforts 
to improve our service, we or someone acting on our behalf may monitor Internet 
activity. This means that a user's session may be tracked, but the user will be 
anonymous. This process does not capture or transmit any personally identifiable 
information and the anonymous or aggregated information may be provided to third 
parties for other purposes.<br>
<br>
When you order services from us to connect to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) 
we generally make information available to the ISP necessary to establish the 
connection.<br>
<br>
We treat information we collect on line similarly to that we collect off-line. 
We do not sell or disclose individually-identifiable information obtained on-line 
to non-Qwest entities except as described above (when Qwest is in a business relationship 
with an unaffiliated party and then under confidentiality restrictions) unless 
you specifically authorize it, it is required by law (including the service of 
subpoenas or court orders in either civil or criminal lawsuits), or disclosure 
is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property.<br>
<br>
The Qwest Web sites may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for 
the content or privacy practices employed by other sites. Other Web sites may 
have different privacy policies or no policy. Users should review the privacy 
policies of any Web site before providing personal information.<br>
<br>
Qwest places banner ads on others' web sites. When we do this, we collect non-personally 
identifiable information through the aid of third parties with whom we contract, 
using the most current browsing technology. This activity allows us to recognize 
a browser's cookie when a browser visits the site and helps us target our Internet 
advertisements. The information collected is anonymous and does not contain any 
information that would personally identify you. The information is shared among 
our contracting agents and our business operations in order to assess the results 
of a promotion or event. <br>
<br>
<b>Security of Your Information:</b> Qwest has databases and systems that are 
maintained to reasonably secure all of Qwest's commercial information, including 
information about customers. All credit card and bank account information you 
submit is encrypted through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software. We transmit the 
entire credit card number or bank information to the appropriate financial institution 
during processing.<br>
<br>
<b>E-Mail Communications:</b> Qwest or its business partners may use email to 
communicate with customers about events or new products and services or to respond 
to visitors' emails. Qwest will not send commercial solicitations via email to 
customers who request it not be sent through the process outlined earlier.<br>
<br>
<b>Children:</b> Qwest does not currently target its online services to children 
under 13 years of age; and Qwest has no intention of collecting any information 
from children under 13 years old. However, some of our sites do contain links 
to content providers that collect such information. These companies are expected 
to comply with all laws pertaining to the collection of information from children. 
Because the Internet offers open access to a wide range of information, it is 
important that parents supervise and prevent access to inappropriate content, 
email or chat sessions.<br>
<br>
</p>
<hr>
<br>
To improve the services it can offer you, Qwest may opt to expand its capabilities 
for obtaining information about users in the future. Qwest will update this privacy 
policy continually to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.<br>
