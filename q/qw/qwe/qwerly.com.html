            <h4>Information Collection: Personally &amp; Publicly Identifiable Information</h4>

            <p>In the course of using the Services, we ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account ("Personally Identifiable Information"). Personally Identifiable Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and postal addresses.

                <br>

                <br>

                Fliptop collects contact information that is publically accessible (e.g. information that is available to search engines)("Publicly Identifiable Information"). Publicly Identifiable Information (e.g. a social network profile that is not set to 'private' or information on a social network page that can be seen to users who are not logged in), is searched and sometimes indexed by Fliptop, just like major Internet search engines. Fliptop recommends that if you do not want to be searched or indexed by search engines or services like Fliptop, that you set the appropriate privacy controls within social networks and 3rd party applications like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. You can learn how to do this by visiting these sites directly.</p>

            <h4>Fliptop Social Contacts Application</h4>

            <p>The Fliptop Social Contacts Application allows Clients to dynamically populate their contacts with social media ids. To enable this application, we will download the contact information for each user's contacts and leads, and use this information to determine social id matches for each contact. We will give users the ability to review these matches and choose the most likely correct match. Fliptop will then store match information for use within the Service.

                <br>

                <br>
