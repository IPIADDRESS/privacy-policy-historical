                          <br>
                          <b>REVISED May 21, 2001</b><br>
                          <br>
                          Like you, we at Qwest are concerned about customer privacy. 
                          We have a long history of maintaining the privacy of 
                          information we obtain in the normal course of providing 
                          our services. While we are working hard to serve you 
                          in new and exciting ways, our commitment to maintaining 
                          your privacy remains as strong as ever.<br>
                          <br>
                          <b>The Information We Obtain and How We Use It</b><br>
                          <br>
                          The information we obtain from you is generally necessary 
                          for us to provide your services and design new services 
                          for your future use. For example, we need to know your 
                          name, address and the services you buy from us to properly 
                          provide and bill for those services. When you call us, 
                          our representatives pull up your records and may refer 
                          to your bill, your calling patterns, and other information 
                          we have to answer questions you may have or recommend 
                          how we can best serve you.<br>
                          <br>
                          We may also use information in our records to protect 
                          our customers, employees or property - for instance, 
                          to investigate fraud, harassment or other types of unlawful 
                          service activities involving Qwest or other carriers 
                          that we do business with. In some cases, it may be necessary 
                          to provide this information to the government or third 
                          parties who make a lawful demand for it.<br>
                          <br>
                          We share information within our Qwest companies to enable 
                          us to better understand our customers' product and service 
                          needs, and to learn how to best design, develop, and 
                          package products and services to best meet those needs. 
                          Like any large business, we may structure our company 
                          to include a number of smaller companies. Currently, 
                          our primary lines of business include local and long 
                          distance services, wireless services, cable services, 
                          dedicated web hosting, dedicated Internet access for 
                          businesses and consumers, on-line services, and directory 
                          publishing. We also offer other products and services, 
                          for example, Frame Relay, Asynchronous Transfer Mode 
                          (ATM), telephone equipment, voice mail services, and 
                          directory advertising. <br>
                          <br>
                          <b>Accuracy of the Information We Hold</b><br>
                          <br>
                          We want to make sure the information we obtain and use 
                          about customers is accurate. To that end, we strive 
                          to verify that our customer records are correct. Much 
                          of this information is reflected in your monthly bill. 
                          If you see an inaccuracy on your Qwest bill, and you 
                          let us know, we can correct it.<br>
                          <br>
                          <b>Security and Accountability</b><br>
                          <br>
                          We have information systems that collect and store customer 
                          information in addition to systems that store our own 
                          business records. These systems have different types 
                          of security as appropriate for the information stored. 
                          Qwest requires employees to keep customer information 
                          confidential and we hold them accountable for their 
                          actions.<br>
                          <br>
                          <b>Providing Services to Enhance Your Privacy</b><br>

                          <b>Disclosure of Information Outside Qwest</b><br>
                          <br>
                          As a general rule, without your permission, Qwest does 
                          not release confidential customer information to unaffiliated 
                          third parties unless we have a business relationship 
                          with those companies where the disclosure is appropriate. 
                          For example, we may hire outside companies as contractors 
                          or agents; or we might be engaged in a joint-venture 
                          or partnership with a company. Upon occasion, Qwest 
                          may decide to stop providing a service or may decide 
                          to sell or transfer parts of our business to unaffiliated 
                          companies. When this happens, we may provide confidential 
                          customer information to these companies so that they 
                          can offer you the same or similar services. In all of 
                          these situations, we provide information to these other 
                          companies only as needed to accomplish our business 
                          objectives and the companies are bound by requirements 
                          to keep Qwest customers' information confidential. <br>
                          <br>
                          There are exceptions to the general rule. For example, 
                          we might provide information to regulatory or administrative 
                          agencies so that they can accomplish their regulatory 
                          tasks (for example, responding to a customer complaint) 
                          or to maximize the efficiencies of our own processes 
                          (such as getting mailing addresses correct, for example). 
                          Other disclosures will be driven by legal requirements 
                          imposed on Qwest. Qwest complies with "legal process," 
                          such as a subpoena or court order or other similar demand, 
                          associated with either criminal or civil proceedings.<br>

                        </p><blockquote>
<b>Disclosure of Account Information</b><br>
<br>
If you tell us in writing to release your account information, we will do so and provide that information to the person you tell us to.<br>
<br>
Your account information is released to other carriers when you give us your permission or when they advise us they have your approval to access the information.  This most often occurs with respect to a sale of service they want to make or have made to you.  Unless we are advised that permission from you has been granted, we do not release the information.<br>
<br>
We may provide account information to collection agencies when customers do not pay their bills.  We restrict the use that can be made of this information to collection activities only for our charges and for the charges we bill for others. <br>
<br>
Other carriers use Qwest to bill for their charges.  In this case, they provide us with information about you, including your calling patterns, and we bill you on their behalf.  In turn, we provide them with non-sensitive information about your service, such as the date your service was established or disconnected; whether you have toll or 900 blocking services, whether you have a calling card or not and when it was issued, how you pay your bills and if they are paid on time.<br>
<br>
<b>Disclosure of Customer Telephone Numbers, Names and Addresses</b><br>
<br>
                          Telephone number, name and sometimes address information 
                          is "released" by Qwest in different ways. 
                          It is sometimes released as "lists" to entities 
                          that are entitled by law to receive the information 
                          or which have entered into contracts with Qwest to receive 
                          it. The information is sometimes released through the 
                          network "transactionally," such as when your 
                          phone number and name are released through a Caller 
                          ID mechanism. Sometimes the information is provided 
                          in reports to those persons who are being called by 
                          you and want to know more about who is calling them 
                          and when. Whether a number is recognized as "published" 
                          or not will generally depend on the medium by which 
                          the number is captured and released.<br>
<br>
For example, a person can ask Qwest to include them in directories (that is "publish" their number) or not.  Persons can ask to not be published in directories but included in Directory Assistance (non-listed numbers).  Or persons can ask not to be either in directories or Directory Assistance (non-published).  All of these terms refer to a "listing" status.  <br>
<br>
However, the telephone <b>network</b> does not recognize a number as published/listed or non-listed or non-published.  Thus, the network will "pass" that number to interconnecting carriers (local, long distance, wireless) and to called parties.  Only if the network (a) has the capability to block the number; and (b) you have invoked a blocking mechanism will the called party (but not the carriers in between) be unable to see the calling number.  And, where both the calling number and name are "carried" as part of the network call, generally either both will be displayed or both will be blocked.<br>
<br>
In some cases, such as on some party- or coin-operated lines, as well as calls to pay-per-call (900) or toll-free numbers (such as 800/888/877 numbers), the network does not have the capability to block your underlying phone number even if you invoke Caller ID blocking.  And there may be other services that rely on this type of automatic number identification (ANI) technology, such as cable companies that offer movies keyed to the automatic delivery of your phone number or pizza companies that route your calls to the closest stores based on your number.  There are a variety of businesses that subscribe to these types of services.  By federal regulation, however, businesses that utilize this technology can only use it to provide you the service in question or one directly related to it.  And, because federal law requires phone numbers associated with facsimile transmissions to be released as part of the facsimile, these phone numbers are not blocked either.<br>
<br>
In addition to the above types of disclosures, Qwest is required, by law, to make disclosures of customer telephone number, name and address information in certain circumstances, including those described below.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> We are required to provide <b>listed</b> customer names, addresses and telephone numbers to directory publishers - our own and others.  Qwest and other directory publishers may publish this information in alphabetical or reverse directories that take the form of paper directories, electronic directories over the Internet, or on CDs.  We also provide customer name and addresses for <b>all</b> customers (including non-listed and non-published customers) to directory publishers to allow for directory deliveries, but <b>only</b> for that purpose.<br>
<br>
</li><li> We are required to provide customer names, addresses and telephone numbers to directory assistance and operator services providers.  This information includes non-listed information, as well as the name and address of non-published customers.  We restrict the use of this information to directory or operator services only.  Some of these providers offer Internet or online directory assistance services.<br>
<br>
</li><li> In some cases, when you dial 911, your name, address and telephone number information is provided to the emergency service provider.  And, by law, we are required to provide this information, including non-listed and non-published information, to emergency service providers and emergency support services providers upon request in a more comprehensive format.  <br>
<br>
</li><li> If you place a long distance call using a provider other than the one you use on your home phone -- for example, if you place a calling card or third number billed call from a pay phone - Qwest is required by law to provide billing name and address information to the service provider.  This includes names and addresses associated with non-published and non-listed information where the individual has not objected.  This information cannot be used for marketing purposes.  Similar information is provided with respect to the provision of services by non-Qwest carriers.<br>
<br>
</li></ul>
We might provide your name and address to administrative agencies where we are working with them to minimize costs and maximize accuracy.  For example, we might share this information with the Post Office so that we continue to get reduced postage rates and you get your bills and other information from us in a cost-efficient, reliable and timely fashion.<br>
<br>
We also compile lists of customer names, addresses and telephone numbers of the type printed in the White Pages directories and provide these lists to qualified companies that are conducting product promotions.  <b>Non-published and non-listed numbers are not included in these lists and we remove other customers from these lists by request.</b>

                          <br>
                          You tell us the telephone listings you want to include 
                          in our directories and in directory assistance. You 
                          also may choose to have a non-published or non-listed 
                          number, or to exclude your address from your listing. 
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          As we addressed above, in certain cases you can block 
                          the transmission of your telephone number (and name) 
                          to those persons you call.<br>

                          To gauge the effectiveness of our Web sites, we do collect 
                          some non-individually-identifiable generic information 
                          about our visitors. Our Web servers automatically recognize 
                          a visitor's Internet service provider, the IP address, 
                          the domain name, the type of browser, and the operating

                          other information related to the operation and interaction 
                          of Qwest Web sites. This information does not reveal

                          <br>
                          You can choose to provide individually-identifiable

                          on a co-sponsored site or feature, you may also be providing 
                          the individually-identifiable information to the co-sponsor. 
                          This will be made clear to you before you submit the 
                          information and you can decide whether or not to participate.

                          <b>E-Mail Communications:</b> Qwest, or those with whom 
                          Qwest has a business relationship, will use email to 
                          communicate with our customers, respond to visitors' 
                          emails, or to inform about events or new products. Qwest 
                          will not send commercial solicitation via email to individuals 
                          who request it not be sent.<br>

                          <b>Children:</b> Qwest does not currently target its 
                          online services to children under 13 years of age; and 
                          Qwest has no intention of collecting any information 
                          from children under 13 years old. However, some of our 
                          sites do contain links to content providers that collect 
                          such information. These companies are expected to comply 
                          with all laws pertaining to the collection of information 
                          from children. Because the Internet offers open access 
                          to a wide range of information, it is important that 
                          parents supervise and prevent access to inappropriate 
                          content, email or chat sessions.<br>
