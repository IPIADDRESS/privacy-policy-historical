                1. What is personal data?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Personal data is all information that directly or indirectly
                (i.e. together with other information) may identify an
                individual. This means that a wide range of data, such as names,
                contact details, IP addresses, and behaviour and choices made
                online can be personal data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Data processing is any operation or set of operations performed
                upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as
                collection, recording, organisation, storage, adaptation or
                alteration, blocking, erasure or destruction of personal data.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Qwaya processes personal data in accordance with applicable
                personal data protection legislation. Within the EU/EEA, the
                general data protection regulation (”GDPR”) will apply from
                25 May 2018.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will process your personal data when it is necessary to: (i)
                fulfil our agreement with you or respond to your inquiries; and
                (ii) comply with a legal obligation. Your data may also be
                processed when it is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate
                interest for Qwaya, inter alia, to market and improving our
                services. If a processing of data requires your prior consent,
                we will collect such consent before carrying out the processing
                in question.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personal data that we request from you and indicated as
                mandatory is required to be provided in order for us to provide
                the service, e.g. for statutory, contractual, administrative or

                4. How long do we keep your information?

            <p>
                We will only keep your information for as long as we need it:
                (i) to provide you with our services; (ii) to improve our
                services or to communicate with you; and (iii) for legal and
                audit purposes. We have routines in place to ensure that
                personal data are deleted thereafter.
            </p>
            <h3 class="margin-top-small">
                5. How do we share your information?
            </h3>
            <p>
                We may share your information with other companies within the
                Funnel Group.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may also engage third parties for the provision of services
                to Qwaya, such as provision of IT-systems, services and other
                activities. Your data may be shared with and processed by such
                service providers on behalf of Qwaya as required for the
                provision of the services to Qwaya. Within the use and provision
                of such services, your personal data may be transferred to
                countries outside the EU/EEA (third countries). In relation to
                such third country transfers, certain security measures will be
                taken in order to protect your data and ensure that the data
                keeps an adequate level of protection, e.g. by entering into a
                data transfer agreement including model clauses issued by the EU
                Commission and available on the EU Commission’s website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personal data may be disclosed to a third party if we are
                required to do so according to applicable laws and regulations
                or in order to detect and prevent fraud or security or technical
                problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Companies which are processing personal data on behalf of us are
                obliged to sign an agreement with us in order to ensure a high
                level of protection for your personal data.

                6. Information security
            </h3>
            <p>
                We strive to provide a high level of protection in all our
                personal data processing. We have therefore taken organisational
                and technical security measures in order to protect your
                personal data from unauthorised access, use, alteration and
                erasure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your password protects your Qwaya account, so you should use a
                unique and strong password, limit access to your computer and
                browser, and log out after having signed in to your Qwaya
                account.

                Furthermore, you need to consent to our use of cookies. If you

            <h4>7.4 Processing of personal data</h4>
            <p>
                Some of our cookies collect personal data. In case you have
