<b>QRZ.COM Privacy Policy</b><br>
</font>

<p>
QRZ, is deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users.
Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible
management of consumer information.  We welcome all users to our site
and want to insure that you are comfortable.  We pledge that as we gather
and use information about you, we do so responsibly.

</p><blockquote>

This site, QRZ.COM, uses the services of Engage for the serving and/or targeting of ads,
promotions and other marketing messages. To do this, Engage collects anonymous data
through the use of cookies. To learn more about Engage, including your ability to opt out of

<p><b>Consumer Information </b>

</p><p>
QRZ.COM publishes information on the World Wide Web and on CDROM
that is obtained from open, public domain sources and in some cases
directly and voluntarily from users themselves.  The information may
include but is not limited to, your name, your address, your email
address and possibly other data that you may voluntarily provide.
</p><p>
This information is generally used by members of the amateur
radio community for the purposes of contacting each other through both
internet and traditional means.   Our site is also used as a means
by which to share common interest information as it applies to the
worldwide community of amateur radio operators.
</p><p>
Amateur radio address and contact information is and has been published
in the public domain for a great many years.  Before the advent of
the Internet and the World Wide Web, the same types of information that
we now provide was routinely published in printed directories (Callbooks).
These directories are of a paramount interest to those involved in
this particular hobby, especially as it applies to the exchange of
written communications that result from contacts made on the air.


</p><p>
<b>Data Collection and Opt Out</b>

</p><p>
Participation in the QRZ data collection process is voluntary except
for the occasional use of browser "cookies".

</p><p>QRZ, as well as most sites on the Internet, occasionaly may use "cookies" to
enhance your experience on the web. QRZ cannot use these cookies to
personally identify you in any way. What are cookies and why do we use
them? A cookie is a unique number that is provided to you the first
time you visit a particular area on our site, or are first served
with a particular advertisement. This unique number, which is stored in a
cookie file on your computer, helps QRZ's advertisers target ads to you. This
cookie can help them ensure that they don't serve you the same ad
multiple times, and it help's our advertisers understand what you like and
don't like about their offerings so that they can cater better to your
needs the next time you are interested in their products or services.
While we believe that cookies enhance your Internet experience by
limiting the number of times you see the same ad and delivering more
relevant content to you.  Cookies are not required for QRZ to deliver
you its content.

</p><p>If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple
procedure to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web
browser's Help documentation for more information.


</p><p>
<b>Opt Out Procedure</b>

</p><p>If you would like to "opt out," that is, to prevent any data from
being stored or displayed by QRZ about you, please notify us by
email.  Please address all correspondence to:
<a href="mailto:editor@qrz.com">editor@qrz.com</a> and simply 
state your amateur radio CALLSIGN and which information you
would like <b>not</b> to have presented by QRZ.


</p><p>
<b>Participation in Industry-side Privacy Initiatives </b>

</p><p>QRZ recognizes several trade associations and privacy groups that are
both actively shaping privacy policies and support consumer privacy. 

</p><p>If you have any additional questions about QRZ's dedication to
consumer privacy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:editor@qrz.com">editor@qrz.com</a>.  </p> </font>
