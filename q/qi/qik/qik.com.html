	<p><b>Cookies &amp; Log Files:</b> Like most web sites, Qik uses cookies and web log files to track site usage.

Qik may collect personally identifiable information directly from visitors on this site who may be under the age of 13. However, Qik does not collect this information without the knowledge of the visitor.</p>

	</ul>

	<h2>Information Sharing</h2>
	<p><b>Sharing Information With Third Parties: </b>Qik takes the privacy of our users very seriously. We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to any third parties for commercial or marketing purposes. We will only share your information with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide specific services. We may however provide personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other businesses or persons for processing such information on our behalf. In these cases, we require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

	<p>We do share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Qik Sites and Service.</p>
	<p>We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally identifiable information if required to do so by law, or if we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>
	<p>Qik also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally identifiable information that Qik believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third party claims or allegations, to assist government or enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our website and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Qik, our Users or others.</p>
	<p><b>Communications Between Users: </b>Many messages you initiate through Qik Site or Service (such as an invitation sent to a non-user), will list your name, email address or cell phone. Messages you initiate may also provide aggregate information about your network (for instance how many people are in your network), but will never list the people to whom youâre directly connected.</p>
	<p><b>Third party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites:</b> Qik may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisement within the Qik Sites and Service. These third party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your web browser, advertisement and links that appear on the Qik Sites and Service. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisement and to personalize the advertising content you see. Qik does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Qik to show an advertisement to certain audience (for example, men between the ages of 24-35) or audience segment (for example, men between the ages of 24-35 who have streamed video live) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use this information regarding your use of Qik Sites and Service, such as number of times you viewed an ad (but not personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.</p>
	<p>If you click on an advertisement, or click a link that takes you to a website that is not operated by Qik, you should familiarize yourself with the privacy practices of that advertiser or website. Qik's Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or websites.</p>

	<h2>Accessing and Changing your Account Information</h2>
	<p>You can review and update your personal information at any time by visiting your profile page. You may of course decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Qik Site and Service, in which case Qik may not be abler to provide certain services to you. Please note that media files by Users of Qik Sites and Service remain subject to our Terms of Service, even if you have deleted them from the pages associated with your account.

	<h2>Our Commitment to Security</h2>
	<p>We pay close attention to security. First, we focus significant time and resources to ensure that user accounts and information are not misused by Qik employees. A limited set of employees are authorized to access user accounts, they are educated about the importance of maintaining user privacy, and their access to user accounts is recorded. Our employees are also contractually required to access accounts and log data only for quality, security, audit, and other internal business purposes. Second, we use commercially reasonable physical, managerial and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We implement technology and procedures to try to make sure that external parties cannot access or modify usersâ personal information on our servers. These technologies and procedures include industry standard methods, like communicating over secure socket layer (SSL), as well as our own proprietary methods. Additionally, private information can be accessed only by providing your password.</p>
	<p>We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Qik over the public networks. Once we receive your information, Qik makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.</p>
	<p>If Qik learns of a security system breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Qik may post a notice on the Qik Sites and Service if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p>
