      <h1>QFX Software Corporation Privacy Policy</h1>
      <b>
      <p>1. In General</p>
      </b>
      <p>QFX Software's privacy policy covers the collection and use of the
      personally identifying information that we ask you to provide when you
      purchase our products or services or interact with our sales or support
      associates. "Personally identifying information" is information
      that individually identifies you, such as your name, physical address, and
      email address. Your privacy is an important issue at QFX Software, and we
      design and operate our services and products with the protection of your
      privacy in mind. Please take a few minutes to learn more about our privacy
      principles and practices, including what type of personal information we
      collect and why we collect it, and what measures we take to safeguard it.</p>
      <b>
      <p>2. What information we collect and for what purpose</p>
      </b><p><b></b>We ask for your personal information when you're signing up for QFX
      services, purchasing a QFX product, downloading a software update, or
      requesting support to a service or product. At such times, your personal
      information is required to identify you as a valid customer.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Some of our services and products may also require that you register or
      be registered for your online accounts with your bank(s) and credit card
      companies, which may ask you for some personal information in order to
      create an account (typically your name, email address and a password for
      your account). We collect only your name, address, and email address to
      identify your account and for providing technical support. The rest of the
      information is saved on your personal computer but is NOT collected by us.
      All of your personal information may also be saved on the online servers
      of your bank(s) and credit card companies. Please see their privacy policy
      statements for information on how these entities handle your personal
      information.</p>
      <b>
      <p>3. How we safeguard the information we collect</p>
      </b>
      <p>Security is a major priority at QFX software, and we take great care to
      protect your personal information. Any personally identifying information
      you provide to us is protected by encryption and is not available to
      anyone else through us.</p>
      <p>We do NOT rent or sell your personally identifying information to other
      companies or individuals.</p>
      <p>Data generated by your use of Monesafe and Monechron are stored only on
      your computer and are encrypted by our software.</p>
      <b>
      <p>4. Cookies</p>
      </b>
      <p>We do not use cookies to collect personal information.</p>
      <p>QFX Software may update its privacy policy from time to time. When we
      change the policy in a substantive way, a notice will be posted on our
      home page along with our updated privacy policy.</p>
