              scope of the QAD network?</b><br>
              As a global company, QAD operates a number of Web sites around the 
              world. Any information that you submit to one of our sites in any 
              one country or language may be sent electronically to a server for 
              one of these sites that might have different web addresses. As such, 
              the information may be used, stored, or processed outside the country 
              where it was recorded.</font>
            </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>How is information 
              collected, used, and disclosed?</b><br>
              We do not collect personal information -- including your e-mail 
              address -- unless we first ask you for it. On some of our sites, 
              we may request that you voluntarily supply us with information, 
              including your e-mail address, street address, telephone number 
              or other information so that we may enhance your site visit or follow 
              up with you after your visit. Whether you provide any information 
              is entirely up to you.</font>
            </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you have 
              voluntarily provided information, you consented to the collection 
              and use of your personally identifiable information as described 
              in this Privacy Statement. In some circumstances, QAD may share 
              information you voluntarily provide us with trustworthy business 
              partners. We do not sell or rent personal information collected 
              through this site to anyone. </font>

              types, domain names, access times, referral addresses, and your 
              activity while using or reviewing our site. QAD may also disclose

              such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or

              cookies and how are they used?</b><br>
              Some QAD sites, like many other commercial web sites, may utilize 
              a standard technology called "cookies" to collect information 
              about how our site is used. Cookies were designed to help a web 
              site operator determine that a particular user had visited the site 
              previously and thus save and remember any preferences that may have 
              been set while the user was browsing the site. Cookies are small 
              strings of text that web sites can send to your browser. Cookies 
              cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or obtain your 
              e-mail address. If you are simply browsing a QAD informational site, 
              a cookie may be used to identify your browser as one that has visited 
              the site before.</font>
            </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may also 
              make use of memory-based cookies in support of authenticating the 
              user of certain QAD web applications. Similarly, if you are a registered 
              user of a site providing service to QAD clients (and have a user 
              ID and password), we may use cookies so that we can provide personalized 
              information based on preferences you have indicated while using 
              the site. Although you have the ability to modify your browser to 
              either accept all cookies, notify you when a cookie is sent, or 
              reject all cookies, it may not be possible to utilize QAD services 
              which require registration if you reject cookies. We do not follow 
              your browsing path outside of the QAD site, except for referral 
              data discussed above. Advertising networks that serve ads onto our 
              web site may also use their own cookies. We have no access or control 
              over these cookies.</font>

              your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of your 
              information?</b><br>
              If you have voluntarily provided information, you consented to the 
              collection and use of your personally identifiable information as 
              described in this Privacy Statement. If, in connection with your 
              use of a particular service, we ask to use your data in a way not 
              described in this Privacy Statement and you do not wish to permit 
              that use, you can choose not to use the particular service.</font>
            </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you have 
              voluntarily provided personally identifiable information, we may, 
              from time to time, send you mail or e-mail regarding products and 
              services. If you do not want to receive such offers and mailings, 
              you can easily indicate that by checking the appropriate box on 
              the submission form.</font>
            </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>How can you 
              correct, access, and update your information?</b><br>
              You may view and edit your personally identifiable information at 
              any time by contacting us using the link provided on the web site. 
              Or if you prefer, you may contact our webmaster at <a href="mailto:webmaster@qad.com">webmaster@qad.com</a>.</font>
            </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>How do we 
              protect your information?</b><br>
              We exercise great care to protect your personally identifiable information. 
              This includes, among other things, using industry standard techniques 
              such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and site monitoring. 
              Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 
              to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your 
              personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant 
              the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from 
              us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via 
              e-mail. We have no way of protecting that information until it reaches 
              us. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to 
              ensure its security on our servers.</font>
            </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Internally, 
              we will restrict access to your personally identifiable information 
              to employees who need access to the information in order to do their 
              jobs. These employees are limited in number, and are committed to 
              our privacy policies. We will review our security arrangements from 
              time to time as we deem appropriate. If we make changes to this 
              privacy policy, we will post the changes on this page so that you 
              always will know what information we collect, how we use it, and 
              when and how we will disclose it.</font>
            </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>How can you 
              help protect your information?</b><br>
              If you are using a QAD web site for which you registered and chose 
              a password, we recommend that you do not divulge your password to 
              anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited 
              phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Also remember to sign out 
              of the registered site by closing your browser window when you have 
              finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access 
              your personal information and correspondence if others have access 
              to your computer.</font>
            </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What about 
              links to other sites?</b><br>
              QAD sites may contain links to other sites, including those of our 
              business partners. While we seek to link only to sites that share 
              our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible 
              for the privacy practices employed by other sites.</font>
