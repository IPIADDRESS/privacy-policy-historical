                            and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream). For example,
                            as explained in more detail below, your Internet browser automatically transmits
                            to this site some of this anonymous information, such as the URL of the Web site

                            your computer is currently using. This site may also collect anonymous information
                            from your computer through cookies and Internet tags or web beacons. You may set
                            your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether,
