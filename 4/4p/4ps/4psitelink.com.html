	 <h2>Privacy Notice</h2>
	 <p>The web site you have entered, www.4PsiteLink.com, is operated by or  on behalf of 4Psite, LLC is committed to protecting  your personal privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the type of  information that is collected by 4PsiteLink on this web site, and how  we use and protect it. This Policy also tells you what to do if you do  not want your Personal Information collected when you visit our web  site, and how you can change information you have already provided to  us. This Policy applies only to the 4PsiteLink web sites listed here.  For example, it does not apply to banners, sweepstakes and other  advertisements or promotions we may sponsor or participate in on web  sites owned by third parties. </p>
     <h2>Your Consent to This Privacy Policy</h2>
     By using our web site, you signify that you agree with the terms of our  current Privacy Policy as posted in this area of the site. If you do  not agree with any term in this Policy, please do not provide any  Personal Information (defined below) on this site. If you choose not to  provide Personal Information on this site, you may not be able to do  certain things, like access particular areas of the site, obtain  certain services or send us e-mail.
     <h2>Collection of Personal Information</h2>
     As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means personally  identifiable information such as the name, street address, telephone  number, credit card information, screen name and email address of  yourself or your customers. The site you entered may collect some of  all of these types of Personal Information. Please be assured that  4PsiteLink will not collect any Personal Information from your visits  to our sites unless you provide this information voluntarily.  When you provide us with Personal Information, you are authorizing us  to use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy  Policy, which includes your right to limit our use of the Personal  Information as described in this Policy (see "Who to Contact" below).  The site you entered may also collect Personal Information from you  about a third party (e.g., the site might allow you to send an  electronic "post card" to a friend, in which case we will need that  person's name and e-mail address). Please note that we use such  information only for the specified purpose (e.g., to mail the post  card) and we will not contact the third party again by e-mail unless  and until the third party contacts us.
     <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
     When you supply Personal Information at this web site, the brand whose  site you entered will use it for the express purpose for which it was  collected (e.g., to provide you with a specific service or to send you  a message). It may also be used by the brand whose site you entered, as  well as by our other brands, to contact you regarding other products  and services that may be of interest to you (including those we may  offer jointly with other companies). (For more information on  4PsiteLink and its brands, see the paragraph about 4PsiteLink at the  end of this Policy.) At any time, however, you may opt out of such  future contact. (See "Who to Contact" below.) At times we may retain  third parties to analyze data we collect on our web sites, including  Personal Information, solely to help us improve our products and our  web sites. In addition, if you order a product or service from us, we  may share Personal Information with suppliers and other third parties  to allow delivery of such product or service. These suppliers and other  third parties are not authorized by us to use your Personal Information  in any other way. Finally, please note that we will release your  Personal Information if required to do so by law, or by search warrant,  subpoena or court order.
