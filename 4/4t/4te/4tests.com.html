<br>Suite D9 429 
<br>Dallas, Texas 75252</p>
<p><a name="collect"></a><b>1. What information of yours does the 4Tests Network 
collect?</b><br>The goal of the 4Tests Network is to be your favorite destination 
on the Internet by providing you with the information, services and product 
offerings that are most relevant to you. To achieve this goal, the 4Tests Network 
needs to collect information to understand what differentiates you from its 
user base. We collect two types of information from you, 
"anonymous information" and "personally identifiable information." Anonymous 
information refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific 
individual. Each time a visitor comes to a 4Tests Network site, 4Tests collects 
some information to improve the overall quality of the visitor's online 
experience.  4Tests collects this user information for purposes of product monitoring, product improvement, 
and targeted advertising. </p>
<p>In addition to this anonymous data, 4Tests may also collect personally 
identifiable information. Personally identifiable information refers to 
information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and postal 
address. Wherever and whenever 4Tests collects personal information through 
registration we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that 
page. 4Tests collects personal information in the following ways from different 
parts of its web sites:</p>

<p>
</p><ol type="a">
<li>Most of the personal information is gathered when you register with one or 
several of the 4Tests Network sites. If you choose to register --and we hope you 
do-- you may provide 4Tests with your name, postal address, email address, birth 
date, gender, zip code, telephone number, occupation, marital status and other 
information. While not all of this information is required, the more information 
you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize 
your experience. Once you register you are given a 4Tests Network ID and are able 
to take full advantage of the many offerings around the 4Tests Network, including 
personalization services. For example, My 4Tests uses your network ID to offer 
you customized news, exam history, email services, and web harddrive services. 
4Tests finds that users who personalize their 4Tests experience come back 
more often. 
<p></p>
</li><li>In addition to registration for various services on the Network, 4Tests may 
ask you for personal information at other times, including when you enter a 
sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by the 4Tests Network and/or our many 
partners. The number and variety of useful services the 4Tests 
Network provides continues to grow and so will your ability to make use of these 
services if you choose to register for them. You never have to register for any 
of these services on the 4Tests Network. This is true on any site on the 
Internet. If you choose not to provide the requested information, the 4Tests 
Network may not be able to offer you some of the personalized services that 
depend on this type of information to function.
<p></p>
</li></ol>
<p>Lastly, we use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a></p>
<a name="cookies"></a><b>2. What are "cookies" and how does 4Tests use them?</b>
<br>In addition to the personally 
identifiable information that 4Tests collects, we also collect information 
"anonymously" using "cookies." Presently, "cookies" play an important role in 
making the Internet work, but there is much confusion among Internet users about 
what cookies are and how they are used. A cookie is a small text file containing 
a unique identification number that is transferred from a web site to the hard 
drive of your computer so that the web site may identify you and track your 
activities on the web site. This unique number identifies your browser-- but not 
you -- to the 4Tests computers whenever you visit one of the sites in the 4Tests 
Network. A cookie will not let a web site know any personally identifiable 
information about you, such as your real name and address. 4Tests is not 
generally interested in any one individual and does not collect personally 
identifiable information about any one person using cookies. The coding in the 
cookies 4Tests sets lets us know that you are using a particular computer but 
nothing more. Since cookies are only text files, they cannot run on your 
computer, search your computer for other information or transmit any information 
to anyone.
<p></p>
<p>To help serve you better 4Tests generally uses cookies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help us remember who you are through your browser settings so that 4Tests can 
offer and provide personalized services, such as My 4Tests and 4Tests Rewards. 
Cookies also allow us to save 
passwords and preferences for you so that you will not have to re-enter them the 
next time you visit. 
</li><li>Measure traffic patterns. Without cookies, it could be difficult for 4Tests 
to know that certain services are more popular than others are. This information 
helps us to better understand when to open up new services. 
</li><li>Displaying advertisements. Third party advertising networks for 4Tests may 
issue cookies when serving advertisements.</li></ul>
<p>The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and you will find them used 
on most major web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. 
If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you have 
received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that 
while 4Tests does not require you to use cookies, certain sites will not function 
properly if you set your browser to not accept cookies. 
</p><p><a name="organization"></a><b>3. What organization is collecting the 
information</b>? <br>When you register information in any Internet domain of the 
4Tests Network, that information is generally collected and maintained solely by 
the 4Tests Network unless specifically stated otherwise at the point of 
collection. For example, some 4Tests Network services, like 4Tests Auctions, are 
offered in conjunction with a partner company. If data is collected and/or 
maintained by any company other than the 4Tests Network, we will tell you at the 
point of collection. If you do not want to share your information with that 
company, you can choose not to use that service. Please see the Section entitled 
"With whom does the 4Tests Network share information that is collected?" for a 
more complete list of companies that 4Tests works with to provide you Products 
and Services.</p>
<p>4Tests runs many promotions and sweepstakes across its Network. These 
promotions may be sponsored or co-sponsored by third-parties. Data collected 
during a promotion is typically shared with the sponsor or co-sponsor. </p>
<p>Be aware that 4Tests Network sponsors and other advertisers have links on our 
sites that take you to other sites that may collect personally identifiable 
information about you. 4Tests hopes that all third parties involved adhere to our 
policies regarding the privacy of our users. However, this 4Tests Network Privacy 
Policy does not cover third party data collection practices and the 4Tests 
Network does not assume any responsibility for any actions of third parties. 
<br></p>
<a name="use"></a><b>4. How does the 4Tests Network use the information it 
collects?</b> <br>Any personal information you provide to 4Tests when registering 
for Products and Services at any of its Network sites is maintained and 
accessible only by the 4Tests Network unless specifically stated otherwise. 4Tests 
requests information from its users so that users can enjoy customized 
experiences across the 4Tests Network, including personalization services, 
discussion boards, games, exam history and many other types of 
content and services. Most of these Products and Services are free to you. In 
order to provide great content and services free of charge, 4Tests displays 
advertisements.
<p></p>
<p>The following are examples of how The 4Tests Network may use the information 
it collects:</p>
<ul>
<li>4Tests uses the aggregate data collected to inform our sponsors as to numbers 
of people who have certain demographic characteristics and the number of those 
people who have seen their advertisement(s). 
</li><li>4Tests also uses the aggregate data to perform statistical analyses of the 
collective characteristics and behavior of our registered users and visitors, to 
measure user demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the 4Tests 
Network and to analyze how and where best to use our resources. Without such 
data, we would not know what the most popular areas of the 4Tests Network are, 
and we would not be able to change and update the content and services 
appropriately. 
</li><li>The 4Tests Network may, from time to time, use your information to contact 
you about changes or enhancements to Products and Services on the 4Tests Network 
</li><li>If you told the 4Tests Network that you were interested in receiving offers 
or information from selected 4Tests Network sponsors and advertisers, 4Tests will 
send you email about products and services that we feel may be of interest to 
you. For those who elect to receive such materials from 4Tests or third parties, 
and who indicate that they do in their profile, 4Tests will release personally 
identifiable information. Information released includes name, e-mail address and 
other information supplied in the 4Tests Network registration process. 
</li><li>The 4Tests Network sometimes uses an individual registered user⚫s data to 
"pre-populate" forms that are displayed for the purpose of collecting individual 
data by the 4Tests Network and/or its advertisers and sponsors. 
</li><li>If you enter a sweepstakes or a contest on the 4Tests Network, we will use 
the information you provided to contact you in the event you win. 
</li><li>4Tests may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide 
information on individual users to the appropriate governmental authorities. In 
matters involving a danger to personal or public safety, 4Tests may voluntarily 
provide information to appropriate governmental authorities.</li></ul>
<a name="share"></a><b>5. With whom does the 4Tests Network share the information that 
is collected?</b> <br>In order to provide you with content and services that 
match your interests, the 4Tests Network has relationships with many of the best 
services and content companies. Many of these services also require registration 
to make them function properly. You can recognize most of these sites by the 
joint branding of 4Tests and such companies. For example, if you see a logo in 
the upper-right corner of the page that says 'Powered by ______', you are on a 
co-branded site. Other third-party relationships are "private label" 
relationships where a Product or Service partner provides 4Tests with technology, 
services and/or content under 4Tests Network branding. Whenever you provide 
registration information on co-branded or private label sites, that data may be 
shared with the partners. You should make every effort to read the individual 
privacy policies of the partners, and make an informed decision on your own 
whether or not to continue based upon these sites' privacy practices and your 
own discretion. 
<p></p>
</font><p><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="-1">In addition to finding co-branded sites, you will find direct links on our 
site to sites offered by third parties. Some of these sites are authorized to 
use the 4Tests Network brands and/or logos. No third-party sites are covered by 
this Privacy Policy. If you feel that a site using a 4Tests Network brand and/or 
logo does not follow an acceptable privacy policy, please contact the 4Tests 
Support Coordinator by email at </font><a href="mailto:support@4tests.com"><font size="2">support@4tests.com</font></a>. 
</p><p><a name="access"></a><b>6. How can you access, edit or delete your 
information?</b> <br>The 4Tests Network provides its registered users the ability 
to access and edit the personal information in their user profiles. For locations where you can access and 
edit your personal information, click on following link:<a href="/users/editinfo.asp">http://www.4tests.com/users/login.asp</a>.</p>
Login. Click on "Edit my Information" then "update your user profile." You will need to use your 4Tests 
Network user ID, password and email address. 

<p></p>
<p>
<a name="optout"></a><b>7. What is the opt-out policy for the 
4Tests Network?</b><br>The 4Tests Network offers you the ability to opt-out of 
receiving information on 4Tests Network updates and new services, as well as 
direct mail offers from selected 4Tests Network partners and sponsors. This is 
done at the point of initial collection of information and during the editing or 
updating process. The instructions to opt out of most 4Tests Network email 
newsletters and direct mail communications are the same as the instructions 
listed above for editing user information profiles. In addition, all 4Tests 
Network newsletters and direct email communications have easy-to-follow 
unsubscribe instructions at the bottom. 
</p><p></p>
<a name="security"></a><b>8. What kinds of security procedures 
are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your 
information?</b> <br>The 4Tests Network has security measures in place to attempt 
to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our 
control. Only authorized employees have access to the information you provide us 
and strict rules on 4Tests Network employees who have access either to the 
databases that store user information or to the servers that host our services. 
While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not 
occur, we make every effort to prevent such unfortunate occurrences. 
<p>
</p><p>You are ultimately responsible for the security of your 4Tests Network ID and 
password. Please take care when using and storing them. 4Tests recommends that 
you do not divulge your password to anyone. You should log out of your browser 
at the end of each computer session to ensure that others cannot access your 
personal information and correspondence, especially if you share a computer with 
someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or 
Internet cafe.</p>
<a name="coppa"></a><b>9. The 4Tests Network notice regarding the 
Children⚫s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)?</b> <br>The 4Tests Network, in 
compliance with the Children⚫s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998, 
provides notice to parents of children under 13 that: 
<ul>
<li>The 4Tests Network may collect personal information from children under 13 
years of age in order to provide them with access to services and content on the 
4Tests Network; 
</li><li>The 4Tests Network needs the consent of parents or guardians to collect, use 
and disclose personally identifiable information about children under 13; 
</li><li>The 4Tests Network has created a mechanism by which parents and guardians can 
provide consent; 
</li><li>The 4Tests Network may not require children under 13 to disclose more 
information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a 
condition of participation; 
</li><li>The 4Tests Network has created a mechanism by which parents or guardians can, 
upon verification, review their children⚫s personal information, ask to have 
that information deleted, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of 
their children⚫s personal information.</li></ul>
<p>In order to provide consent for your child, please click on the link below, 
and sign up for a 4Tests Membership.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.4tests.com/users/register.asp"><font size="2">Sign me up for a 
4Tests Membership!</font></a></p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Notice, about the 4Tests 
Membership, or about the collection or maintenance of your child⚫s personal 
information anywhere on the 4Tests Network, please contact us at the above address. </p>
<p>The 4Tests Network encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with 
their children and to participate in the activities offered on the sites that 
they visit. No information should be submitted to or posted at the 4Tests Network 
by visitors and registered users under 13 years of age without the consent of 
their parent or guardian.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><a name="types"></a><b>What types of personal information does the 4Tests 
Network collect from children and how is it collected?</b> </li></ol>
<p>The 4Tests Network is proud to provide children with access to the best 
educational and entertainment content and services available online. In order to 
provide high quality services, and in order for certain of these services to 
function properly, the 4Tests Network collects information from users who are 
under the age of 13. </p>
<p>The 4Tests Network collects three types of information from children: 
anonymous information, information that can be tied to particular user⚫s 
computer or to the systems used by users to gain Internet access, and personally 
identifiable information that is specific to a person⚫s identity. Each time a 
visitor comes to a 4Tests Network site, the 4Tests collects some information to 
improve the overall quality of the online experience. 4Tests collects the 
visitor's IP address, referral data (e.g., the address of the last URL a user 
visited prior to clicking through to a 4Tests Network site), and browser and 
platform type (e.g., Internet Explorer and MacIntosh platform). 4Tests collects this user information for 
purposes of product monitoring, product improvement, and targeted advertising. 
</p>
<p>In addition to anonymous data and information that can be tied to a 
particular user⚫s computer or to systems used for Internet access, the 4Tests 
Network may also collect personally identifiable information that is specific to 
a person⚫s identity. By personally identifiable information, 4Tests means 
information that tells us specifically who you and your child are, such as your 
names and email address. </p>
<p>The 4Tests Network does not knowingly permit children under the age of 13 to 
register without the verifiable consent of their parents or guardians. The best 
way for parents to give verifiable consent to 4Tests is by signing up for a 4Tests 
Membership. When you provide information about yourself and your child 
during registration for a 4Tests Membership, that information is collected 
and maintained by the 4Tests Network and, if the functionality of the service so 
requires, by the providers of those specific services and content. The 4Tests 
Membership allows access for children under 13 to the 4Tests Network.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="protect"></a><b>11. What you can do to better protect 
yourself on the Internet</b> <br>
</p><ol type="A"><b>
</b><li><b>Know the risks.</b> <br>When you communicate with others online, you should 
be aware that, when disclosing personal information such as one's actual name, 
member name, e-mail address, etc., on a web page, in a newsgroup, chat room or 
forum, that information may be collected and used by others to send that person 
unsolicited e-mail from other parties, outside the 4Tests Network. Some of the 
e-mail you receive may be useful to you, but some may not. In an effort to 
curtail unsolicited e-mail, 4Tests blocks certain e-mail addresses and domains 
from sending e-mail to e-mail addresses at our domains. <b>
</b></li><li><b>Educate yourself.</b> <br>Search the Web for as much information as you can 
about how to protect your privacy. Look for a privacy statement in the sites you 
visit. Please visit the Federal Trade Commission⚫s web site and read
