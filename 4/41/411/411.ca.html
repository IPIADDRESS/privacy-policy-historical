These practices seek to balance an individual’s right to the privacy of his or her personal information and the need for 411.ca to collect, use, disclose and otherwise manage the personal information provided through the use of the Site and personal information submitted to 411.ca in respect of various services offered by us. We may update this Policy from time to time and you are responsible for reviewing the most current version of this Policy. This Policy was last amended on the date shown at the end of the Policy.
