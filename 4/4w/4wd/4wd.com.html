                  <p><b>Shipping</b><br>
                    All shipments are F.O.B. Columbiana, Ohio. Small items (under 
                    150 pounds) will be shipped by ground service, or Federal 
                    Express Air if requested. Larger items will be shipped by 
                    truck freight. We do not ship C.O.D. orders to a P.O. Box, 
                    APO, or FPO. All orders must have complete shipping address 
                    and phone number. <b>Truck freight is tailgate only, customer 
                    must have someone available to unload freight.</b></p>
                  <p><b>Foreign Orders</b><br>
                    All foreign orders require payment in advance. Due to various 
                    rate differences and depending on which items are ordered, 
                    freight fees will vary. It is important that you contact our 
                    International Sales Department (1-330-482-4924 or 1-330-482-5560) 
                    regarding all foreign orders. All foreign orders must have 
                    a phone number. We have no control over value-added taxes 
                    or duty charges. These are the responsibility of the customer. 
                    All special orders and all foreign sales are final. <b>We 
                    accept no backorders on foreign orders.</b></p>
                  <p><b>Damaged Shipments</b><br>
                    Upon receipt of an obviously damaged package, you have the 
                    option of refusing delivery and the order will be returned 
                    to Four Wheel Drive Hardware. Or, you may receive the order 
                    and make note of the visible damage, in writing, to the carrier. 
                    If, upon inspection of the parts, you find them damaged due 
                    to the carriers handling, you then have 48 hours to file a 
                    formal claim with the carrier. <b>DO NOT RETURN THE DAMAGED 
                    PARTS TO US.</b> Keep the package and parts as close as possible 
                    to the condition in which you received them. Without the package, 
                    the carrier will void your claim. Claims for shortages due 
                    to carrier negligence must be made within five (5) working 
                    days of receipt of merchandise. Please notify our customer 
                    service department as to what has occurred so that we may 
                    assist you and answer any questions you may have on your claim.</p>
                  <p><b>Refused Shipments</b><br>
                    Any customer who refuses a C.O.D. delivery of an order (damaged 
                    shipment excluded) will be required to pay the additional 
                    return freight charges. These charges must be paid in full 
                    before any future orders will be shipped.</p>
                  <p><b>Return Authorization</b><br>
                    At your discretion, you may return all or part of any order

                    <br>
                    a) Original packaging has been damaged and therefore the product 
                    must be inspected and repackaged. This procedure is intended 
                    to insure our customers always receive fresh merchandise.<br>
                    <br>
                    b) The product has been damaged and cannot be resold as new. 
                    If damage is significant, the product will be returned to 
                    the original customer.</p>
                  <p><b>Backorders</b><br>
                    Sometimes it becomes necessary to cancel orders for a backorder 
                    or discontinued part. Therefore, we reserve the right to cancel 
                    these orders. Backorders, if any, will not be billed until 
                    they become available and are shipped. There is no additional 
                    shipping charge on backorder shipments.</p>

                    your Jeep ID information and to expedite any future orders. 
                    A "cookie" is a small text file that a website can 
                    place on your computer's hard drive in order, for example, 
                    to collect information about your activities on the site or 
                    to make it possible for you to use an online "shopping 
                    cart" to keep track of items you wish to purchase. The 
                    cookie transmits this information back to the Web site's computer, 
                    which, generally speaking, is the only computer that can read 
                    it. Most consumers do not know that "cookies" are 
                    being placed on their computers when they visit websites. 
                    If you want to know when this happens, or to prevent it from 
                    happening, you can set your browser to warn you when a website 
                    attempts to place a "cookie" on your computer. Our 
                    site relies upon the use of cookies to enhance your shopping
