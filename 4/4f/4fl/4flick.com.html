              located at www.intermarkmedia.com (the "Site") and its
              affiliated sites as noted herein. By using or accessing the Site,

            about Site users unless such information is voluntarily provided
            by the user. Our registration forms require consumers to provide
            certain contact information such as name and email address. This
            contact information is used and shared to facilitate the process
            of the service the consumer requests to send you promotional offers for various products and services via direct mail, telemarketing, SMS text messaging and email from third parties whom we work with that we feel may be of interest to you. Consumers who opt-in to receive
            offers or voluntarily provide their personal information to Intermark
            may receive email, telephone calls or direct mail from Intermark
            or our partners with whom we share personal information. If you do
            not want to receive offers from Intermark or its partners, you may
            opt-out of receiving future communications; see the Choice/Opt-Out
            section below. </font></p>
            <p class="body"><font size="2"> We may need to disclose personal information
              when required by law and when we have a good-faith belief that
              such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding,
              a court order or legal process served on us or to assist in the
              investigation of any potential fraud. We may also disclose personal
              information in connection with a sale, merger or reorganization
            of Intermark. </font></p>

            (or aggregate information) during your use of our Site, including
            IP address, pages viewed, click-stream data and browsing habits.
            Non-personal information may be shared with third parties who are

            <p class="body"><font size="2"> Our Site uses cookies to keep track
              of your session and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly.
              We use (and our third party advertisers may use) cookies to deliver
              content specific to your interests. We also use cookies once a
              form is submitted as an indicator that the application was filled
              and if you try to fill out another one within 60 days it will give
              you an option to either fill out another application or leave. "Cookies" are
              pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a
              web site for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication
              and interaction with that web site. Many web sites use cookies
              for these purposes. You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies
              on your computer or flush them from your browser by adjusting your
              web browser preferences, in which case you may still use our Site,
              but it may interfere with some of its functionality. Intermark
              does not use cookies to automatically retrieve personal information
            from your computer without your knowledge. </font></p>
            <p class="body"><font size="2"> In addition to cookies, we may also
              use (and our third party advertisers may use) clear gifs or web
              beacons to improve the performance of the Site, provide certain
              features such as advertising or to anonymously track usage of the
              Site. Clear gifs / web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique
              identifier, which operate much like a cookie, and are used to track
              the online activity of Site users. In addition, we may use such
              devices in our HTML-based emails to track the usage of such emails
              in much the same manner as usage of the Site is tracked. These
              devices are not used by Intermark to automatically collect person
            information. </font></p>

                128-bit encryption to transfer any personal information that you
                may submit in our application. However, due to the inherent open
                nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications will
                be free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers
            and your use of the Site demonstrates your assumption of this risk. </font></p>
