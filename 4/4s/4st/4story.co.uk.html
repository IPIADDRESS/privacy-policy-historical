Included in this are the client- as well as the server-based games.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, this Privacy Policy exclusively regulates how Gameforge treats your personal information. In case you make use of services provided by third parties, the Privacy Policy conditions of these third parties apply exclusively. Gameforge does not revise Privacy Policy conditions of third parties.<br><br><b>Data controller</b><br>The data controller according to the Federal Data Protection Act is Gameforge 4D GmbH, Albert-Nestler-Strasse 8, 76131 Karlsruhe.<br>

Please - if possible – indicate the online game that you have played, the server and your player name.

Collection of information</b><br>Generally, you can access our Internet offering without disclosing any personal information to us. It is always your choice whether or not to provide us with your personal information. We only collect, process and use personal information – unless already permitted by statutes – with your consent.

This information includes, for example, your name, address, e-mail address and other personal information which Gameforge may query in individual cases. In many cases it is possible to use Gameforge’s services by using pseudonyms. Users are encouraged to make use of this feature.<br>
<br>
In addition, individual information such as IP address, browser type and access time will automatically be transferred to us via your computer and will be stored on our server. Except for the purpose of prosecuting unauthorized use of our website, we evaluate such information only for statistical and performance-related purposes. Where possible, the information is anonymized.<br>

In order to make the use our Internet pages as pleasant as possible, we use,  like many other companies, so-called cookies.

<br>
Gameforge uses your personal information for the establishment, processing and settlement of your user relationship with Gameforge and the processing of payments. Correct execution of the user relationship refers specifically to assuring the players’ full compliance with the terms of use and game rules. We provide you with a client download making participation in one of our games possible and upon installation of this download, a programme protecting against illegal game use and data manipulation can be simultaneously installed in order to avoid manipulation or deceitful use of the game.<br>

These types of programmes are launched with the game in question and serve exclusively to protect the client- and server- side data of the game. During gameplay, an analysis of the client software, the technical communication of the clients’ and our servers, as well as illegal technical manipulation and help devices (in particular hacks and cheats) can be conducted. Any non-relevant information will not be investigated. Neither the internal game communication nor the data foreign to the game will be evaluated. As long as no change to the client or to the communication between client and server is discovered on your computer, personal data will not be collected and will not be passed on to the game server or to Gameforge. If a violation, in particular a technical manipulation and a violation against the terms of use and game rules, is discovered on your PC, the necessary personal data will be transmitted to Gameforge in order to consequently deal with the infraction.<br>
