				<p>When using our website, we also collect information automatically, some of which may be personal data. This includes data such as language settings, IP address, location, device settings, device OS, log information, time of usage, URL requested, status report, user agent (information about the browser version), operating system, result (viewer or booker), browsing history, user Booking ID, and type of data viewed. We may also collect data automatically through cookies. For information on how we use cookies, click <a href="/cookie-policy" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

				<h3>Processing Purposes
</h3>

				<p>We use your personal data for the following purposes:</p>
				<div class="policy--privacy-no-bullets">
					<ul>
						<li>A. Reservations: We use your personal data to complete and administer your online reservation. </li>
						<li>B. Customer Service: We use your personal data to provide customer service. </li>
						<li>C. Guest Reviews: We may use your contact data to invite you by email to write a guest review after your stay. This can help other travelers to pick the accommodations that suits them best. If you submit a guest review, your review may be published on our website.</li>
						<li>D. Marketing Activities: We also use your data for marketing activities, as permitted by law. Where we use your personal data for direct marketing purposes (e.g. commercial newsletters and marketing communications on new products and services or other offers we think may be of interest to you), we include an unsubscribe link that you can use if you do not want us to send messages in the future.</li>
						<li>E. Other Communications: There may be other times when we contact you by email, mail, phone, or texting, depending on the contact data you share with us. There could be a number of reasons for this:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>a. We may need to respond to and handle requests you've made.<br>b. If you haven't finalized a reservation online, we may email you a reminder to continue with your reservation. We believe this additional service is useful to you because it allows you to carry on with a reservation without having to search for the accommodation again or filling in all the reservation details from scratch.<br>c. When you use our services, we may send you a questionnaire or invite you to provide a review about your experience with our website. We believe this additional service is useful to you and to us, as we will be able to improve our website based on your feedback.
</li>
						</ul>
						<li>F. Analytics, Improvements, and Research: We use personal data to conduct research and analysis. We may involve a third party to do this on our behalf. We may share or disclose the results of such research (including to third-parties) in anonymous, aggregated form. We use your personal data for analytical purposes to improve our services, enhance the user experience, and improve the functionality and quality of our online travel services.</li>
						<li>G. Security, Fraud Detection, and Prevention: We use the information, which may include personal data, in order to prevent fraud and other illegal or infringing activities. We also use this information to investigate and detect fraud. We can use personal data for risk assessment and security purposes, including the authentication of users. For these purposes, personal data may be shared with third parties, such as law enforcement authorities as permitted by applicable law and external advisers.</li>
						<li>H. Legal and Compliance: In certain cases, we need to use the information provided, which may include personal data, to handle and resolve legal disputes or complaints, for regulatory investigations and compliance, or to enforce agreement(s), or to comply with lawful requests from law enforcement insofar as it is required by law.</li>
						<li>If we use automated means to process personal data which produces legal effects or significantly affects you, we will implement suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms, including the right to obtain human intervention.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<h3>Legal Bases</h3>

				<ul>
				    <li>In view of purposes A and B, we rely on the performance of a contract: The use of your data may be necessary to perform the contract that you have with us. For example, if you use our services to make an online reservation, we will use your data to carry out our obligation to complete and administer that reservation under the contract that we have with you.</li>
				    <li>In view of purposes C - H, we rely on its legitimate interests: We use your data for our legitimate interests, such as providing you with the best appropriate content for the website, emails, and newsletters to improve and promote our products, services, and the content on our website, as well as for administrative, fraud detection, and legal purposes. When using personal data to serve our legitimate interests, we will always balance your rights and interests in the protection of your information against our rights and interests.</li>
				    <li>In respect of purpose H, we also rely, where applicable, on our obligation to comply with applicable law.</li>
				    <li>Where needed under applicable law, we will obtain your consent prior to processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. </li>
			 	</ul>
				<p>If needed in accordance with applicable law, we will ask for your consent. You can withdraw your consent anytime by contacting us at any of the addresses at the end of this Privacy Statement.</p>
				<p>If you want to object to the processing set out under C-F and there's no opt-out mechanism available to you directly (e.g. in your account settings), to the extent applicable, please contact

While we provide the content to this website and you make a reservation directly with us, the reservations are processed through Booking.com. The information you enter into this website will therefore also be shared with Booking.com and its affiliates. This information may include personal data including your name, your contact details, your payment details, the names of guests traveling with you, and any preferences you specified when making a booking. <br>
				    	To find out more about the Booking.com corporate family, visit <a href="https://www.booking.com/content/about.html">About Booking.com</a>.

Booking.com may use your data for technical, analytical, and marketing purposes as further described in the <a href="https://www.booking.com/content/privacy.html" target="_blank">Booking.com Privacy Policy</a>. This includes that your data might also be shared with other members of the Booking Holdings Inc. group of companies for analysis to provide you with travel-related offers that may be of interest to you and to offer you customized service. If needed under applicable law, Booking.com will first ask for your consent. If your data is transferred to a country outside the European Economic Area, Booking.com will make contractual arrangements to ensure your personal data is still protected in line with European standards.
