                <span class="smallText"><span title="  Credit Control for Christmas  
  Collecting unpaid debts at any time of the year can be difficult but even more so over the Christmas period. That’s why it is crucial to increase your credit control efforts in December so that the likelihood of weak cash flow in January is reduced.  
 &nbsp; 
  Put in place these simple tips to keep the cash flowing over Christmas:  
  1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Ensure all your invoices go out on time   
  2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Call your customers before the invoice is due to make sure there aren’t any queries  
  3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Be aware of the clients who are due to make payment over the Christmas shut down period  
  4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Make a note of when these clients make payments and find out if they will be making payments over this period  
  5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Offer a discount for early settlement before Christmas  
  6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Take action on late payers now because it will be even more difficult to collect in the new year  
  7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Over the Christmas period, ensure all master records are up to date such as name &amp; address details and also ensure that all payments or credits are allocated correctly  
  8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Send a letter to each of your clients to set them up on standing orders.&nbsp;Paying by standing order will reduce your admin costs, reduce your clients admin costs and save time  
  Sticking to a few simple rules will ensure that your cash flow doesn’t come to a standstill over the Christmas period and making sure everything is up to date while it’s quiet will mean a fresh start in the new year to start collecting those invoices, on time every time.  
  If you are approaching a busy time and would like an extra pair of hands to help with your credit control please give us a call on 01256 462816 or email us at     info@fcmsolutions.co.uk    .  
 &nbsp; 
  We hope you have a successful Christmas and good luck with your collections
