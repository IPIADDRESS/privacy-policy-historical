                <span class="smallText"><span title=" One thing that any small, home based business owner will need to know is; “What expenses can I claim for running my business from home?&quot; 
 
Surprisingly, there are no ‘standard’ or recognised methods of calculating these allowable expenses, although there are a number of conventions and guidelines which we, in the profession, tend to adhere to. 
 
In the ‘good old days’ we accountants would simply claim a global ‘round sum’ amount (often about £20 - £30 per month) to cover these costs, which was never challenged by HMRC, as it was not significant or worth amending. 
 
However, since 2004, the limit of these round sum amounts has been capped at £2 per week (or £104 per year). Anything above this rate is increasingly likely to trigger an investigation. 
 
If we feel that the £2 is insufficient, we can claim specific costs, based on actual expenditure. 
 
  Main Criteria   
 
• We must actually work from home, and have a dedicated area for this work (doing the books on the kitchen table once a week simply won’t cut it) 
• Expenses must be ‘wholly and exclusively’ for the business. If mixed usage (part business, part personal) the business part must be separately identifiable. 
• Where an area of the house is used partly for business, and partly for personal, the expenses will be apportioned by time used, as well as floor area utilised. 
 
  What Can We Claim   
 
The following property expenses can be claimed: 
 
• Light and Heat 
• Rent / Mortgage Interest 
• Council Tax 
• Water Rates 
• Property Insurance 
• Cleaning 
• Re decoration and repairs (internal and external) 
 
  Calculating ‘Business’ Element   
 
As a general rule, we tend to apportion all of the above costs on the basis of floor area utilised. In reality, this may be difficult to calculate, so it is perfectly acceptable to work on the basis of numbers of rooms in the house. If, for example, we use one room for business purposes, and there are four further rooms, the business element will be 1/5, or 20% of the total running costs of the home. If we further estimate that this room is used 50% for business, and 50% personal, the percentage claimed will be halved to 10%. 
 
 
  Other Claimable Costs   
 
In addition to our home, we can claim any expenses utilised ‘wholly and exclusively’ for the purposes of the business, including: 
 
• Telephone (including line rental) apportioned by call time (incoming and outgoing). A dedicated business line can be claimed in full. 
• Broadband (as telephone costs) 
• Business insurance 
• Repairs to business equipment 
• Capital allowances (wear and tear) on business equipment. (including computers and peripherals, office furniture and fixtures such as shelving etc). 
• Printing, stationery, postage and advertising 
• Computer software used for business 
• Travelling and subsistence costs (a whole topic in it’s own right). Subsistence relates to the ourselves only. Any entertaining of suppliers, business associates and, even, customers is totally disallowable. 
• Motor expenses of running business vehicles (less any personal element). 
 
Examples of expenses claims we can make in certain circumstances are given in the HMRC guidance manual;    http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/BIM47825.htm    
 
  Pitfalls   
 
When claiming expenses relating to our home business, we need to be aware of some potential issues: 
 
• We can claim any costs directly attributable to the business working area of our home (such as decorating the home office, installation of specialist equipment, additional utility supplies, insulation etc) However, if we treat a room as being 100% for business, then, on the sale of our house, the percentage of the sale relating to the ‘business’ area will, potentially be subject to Capital Gains Tax. This will only be an issue where a significant profit is made, as smaller gains will be covered by our annual exemption. **UPDATE** From June 2008, HMRC have announced that this will no longer be an issue, and that capital gains tax will no longer be charged where home business expenses, such as mortgage interest etc are claimed against profits. 
• Most mortgage companies ask us to stipulate whether or not there is a business element to our occupation. We may need to be able to prove to them that we have separate business insurance to cover us for this. 
• Running a business from home may attract the attention of the Valuation Office Agency who will determine whether or not a property will attract business rates. Guidelines for this can be found at:    http://www.voa.gov.uk/council_tax/working_from_home.htm    
 
Legislation is constantly being updated, and the only piece of advice that never changes is; Always check with your accountant, when looking to claim or calculate these expenses. "> One thing that any small, home based business owner will ne...</span></span><br>

                <span class="smallText"><span title="  In case you hadnt noticed, its January. You mightve been fooled by all the rain into thinking its April, but you certainly wont have missed the messages hitting you from all sides about goal setting and resolutions for the year ahead.  
  In fact, you might be one of the staggering 78% of people who admit that their big plans and New Year resolutions have already drawn their last breath before the second week of January has begun.  
  So how can you create business goals that stand a chance of succeeding? This guide from Tangerine Trees will give you 13 painless ways to commit to goals that you can achieve!  
  1. Honesty is the best policy  
  &nbsp;  
  Be honest about why your goals have dropped away so quickly. Could it be one of the Three Is that are to blame?  
  &nbsp;  
  The first I is Insincerity, and as the name suggests, it means the goal we set is not really one we want to achieve. It could be a half-hearted wish, a target set by someone else, or something we know we should do but we have no drive for.  
  &nbsp;  
  The second I is inconsistency. If for any reason our goal doesnt work to increase our own self-image or were unconvinced of its effect, we can subconsciously sabotage our chances of succeeding.  
  &nbsp;  
  The third I is imprecision, and is often the slipperiest of the Is. When we communicate decisions, either to ourselves or others, we must first pass through the mental filters that process information. Previous experiences, biases and images are just some of the filters that can distort a message.  
  &nbsp;  
  2. Think big. Dream big dreams.   
  &nbsp;  
  Do you have the ability to achieve what you deserve? Of course you do. And participating in a programme like this one shows that you are also keen to expand your knowledge.  
  &nbsp;  
  But business owners often dont realise that their own limiting beliefs actually hold back the entire company from achieving its potential.  
  &nbsp;  
  If you can imagine it, you can achieve it. So choose to set yourself bigger, better, clearer targets, and communicate them thoroughly to everyone who will be affected. Write them down to get a clear emotional commitment in your mind, and refer to your plans regularly.  
  &nbsp;  
  In no time, your dreams wont just look achievable, theyll probably be exceeded!  
  &nbsp;  
  3. Put time aside every single week to test something new on a small scale  
  &nbsp;  
  If you start to lose momentum in your goal focus, you could miss out on the one strategy that transforms your business.  
  &nbsp;  
  Always try any new ideas on a small scale to minimise your risk and expenditure, and make a note of the results. If it doesnt work for your business, you can safely put it back in the pile.  
  &nbsp;  
  But, if it starts to achieve real results for you, see how high you can grow, then launch it on a really big scale.  
  &nbsp;  
  4.  Think it through   
   
All winning teams, sports or otherwise, know they must have a specific goal in mind to work towards. And it is exactly the same with your life as well.&nbsp;   
  &nbsp;  
  While the plan must be flexible to allow for opportunities that you are not yet aware of, to have no strategy at all means that youll just bounce from one thing to another.&nbsp; Choosing a specific target BEFORE you throw the ball will make your success rate go up immensely.&nbsp; Ask yourself:&nbsp; What does the end result look like?&nbsp;   
  &nbsp;  
  5. Sell something that is at least twice the price of your current highest priced item or service.   
  &nbsp;  
  How could you offer a more expensive, exclusive or comprehensive version of your current product range? How would you position it? What would it consist of?  
  &nbsp;  
  There is a significant segment of the population who have access to serious wealth, and some of them could well be within your existing customer base. So target the wealthy segment of your audience or market with something positioned just for them.  
  &nbsp;  
  Even if the expensive items were only sold to 2 or 3% of your customer base, imagine the impact that would have on your profit margins. And on your customer lifetime value. And on your position as leader of your field.  
  &nbsp;  
  6.  &nbsp; Sell something people crave  
  &nbsp;  
  The products and services sold by the majority of businesses are needed by a huge amount of their customers and prospects.  
  &nbsp;  
  But needing isnt the same as wanting.  
  &nbsp;  
  Do you find you have to convince your audience that your offering will be beneficial to them? Wouldnt it be great to sell something that people may not need, but they desperately want?  
  &nbsp;  
  Think for a moment about Borders bookstores. Although their target audience often love books, they dont necessarily want them. But they do want a great coffee and a delicious muffin. So, by teaming up with Starbucks, they can bring customers through the door for a want, and create additional sales from there.  
  &nbsp;  
  Food and drink are often items that people crave, but there could be ">  In case you hadnt noticed, its January. You mightve been f...</span></span><br>

                <span class="smallText"><span title="A Considerate SIPP Provider

Since the regulation of self invested personal pensions (SIPPs) in April 2007, around 150 SIPP providers have obtained authorisation from the Financial Services Authority to operate a SIPP product. Since April, several publications have highlighted that many of the products offered as SIPPs are in fact beefed-up personal pensions offering no more than access to a platform of fund managers and collective investments.

Indeed, with the UK stock markets having retreated from six year highs and uncertainty in other global markets, coupled with UK commercial property prices also looking expensive, many investors are looking to SIPPs to offer alternative investment avenues with the potential for future gain.

Dentons SIPP, being one of the few SIPPs on the market, with full investment and contribution functionality, will consider the more esoteric investments that many other SIPP providers cannot, or will not entertain.

Such opportunities include both unquoted funds and shares as well as overseas property. However, in respect of the latter, price reductions in Spanish and US properties are also reported, so investors may be looking elsewhere. 

Whilst residential property is still unavailable to SIPPs, other than through specialist collective vehicles, Dentons are currently working with commercial property developers on top-end market hotel accommodation in Himmapan, Thailand, and Caicos Beach in Turks and Caicos.

Hotel accommodation is regarded as commercial and is acceptable to HMRC, provided it satisfies the following criteria:-

           No privileged occupational rights can be made available, either at the hotel or at any other facility, to any individual connected to the SIPP as a result of the investment.

           The accommodation must not be capable of long-term residential occupation.

In respect of the latter, it is usual that the room / suite will not have full kitchen or laundry facilities and in some circumstances may have extremely limited wardrobe space. It is also usual for the hotel to be designated as being on commercial land. Individual villas that are not part of a hotel complex cannot satisfy these criteria.

The two investment opportunities mentioned above are effectively off-plan or at initial stage of development with reputable developers, offering a chance to buy into the property at substantially discounted rates. On completion the property unit is leased back to the hotel management group for a share in the rental yield. Gearing may also be available and it is usual for a secondary market to exist should clients wish to realise their investments.

Whilst Dentons cannot advise as to whether investments such as these are suitable for the particular circumstances of individual SIPP clients, they can confirm whether or not the planned investment is one that is approved for use within SIPPs. 

Dentons have also structured their SIPP such that the member is appointed co-Trustee of their plan to sit alongside the Dentons trustee company. We believe that this provides the member with a greater feeling of control and ownership that some other products in the marketplace do not offer. The member can, therefore, be actively involved in the buying process, the selection of professionals to assist in the purchase and the management of the property once owned.

Dentons will, however, insist upon good title to the property and a correct legal process to protect the interests of the beneficiary.

            <strong>Biography: <span title=" I am a nurse and a coach and am launching  www.happynurses.co.uk &nbsp;to help nurses to create healthy happy lives for themselves. 
 I have worked as a general, paediatric, hospital, community, specialist and agency nurse in Bath, Bristol, Manchester, Bournemouth, Gloucester and Cheltenham. I currently live in Cheltenham, but would love to live by the sea in the next couple of years, or just have a 'crash-pad' (to quote Phil and Kirsty!) there, probably Dorset. 
 I trained as a coach with the Coaching Academy, graduating with Distinction. I love helping people to move onwards and upwards&nbsp;in their lives, develop their confidence and achieve their dreams. 
 I have a global vision for the happynurses business with web and off-line parts to the business. There is a membership site, products, services and merchandise available to help nurses. 
 I love to laugh, see and do live comedy and impro, listen to and sing music, talk, walk, keep fit, learn, travel, teach, help, lounge about, read obsessively and meet other people. 
 I am also currently looking for a top bloke to join me in my wonderful life - especially one&nbsp;with wit, intelligence, fun, good health&nbsp;and a big bank balance....oh and a sea-view apartment - all sensible offers considered!
