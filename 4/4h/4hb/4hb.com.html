<font color="#990033"><b>Privacy Policy</b></font>
</p><p>

<b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
<br>
Capella Systems Group, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on 4hb.com. 4hb.com
collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.<br>
<br>

<b>Cookies</b><br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.  Usage of a cookie
is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use session ID cookies.  For
the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. Cookies enable us to track and
target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. <br>
<br>
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers).  However, we have no access to
or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising.  <br>
<br>

<b>Third Party Advertisers</b><br>
We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site.
These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time 
and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order
to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically 
use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising 
practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit <a href="http://networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">http://networkadvertising.org</a>.<br>
<br>

<b>Log Files</b><br>
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files.  This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser
type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks
to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information
for aggregate use.  IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. <br>
<br>
<b>Sharing</b><br>
<br>
<b>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</b><br>
We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personally
identifiable information.<br>
<br>
<b>Legal Disclaimer</b><br>
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required
by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding,
a court order or legal process served on our Web site.<br>
<br>
<b>Communications from the Site</b><br>
<br>
<b>Newsletter</b><br>
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.
 Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications.  Please see the Choice
and Opt-out sections.<br>
<br>
<b>Service Providers</b><br>
We occasionally partner with other third parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these
particular services, we share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide
these services.  These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the
purpose of providing these services.<br>
<br>
<b>Business Transitions</b><br>
In the event 4hb.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another
company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the
assets transferred.  Users will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change
of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally
identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will
be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.<br>
<br>
<b>Choice/Opt-out</b><br>
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related
to our site at the point where we ask for information. <br>
<br>
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these
communications by following the unsubscribe instructions in any email.<br>
<br>
Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties.  We do
this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require
an outside party.<br>
<br>
<b>Links</b><br>
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, 4hb.com, are not responsible
for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and
to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This
privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.<br>
<br>
<b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b><br>
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys
or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
 The requested information typically includes only contact information (such as name and e-mail address), and demographic
information (such as zip code).  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Anonymous
survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.
 Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice.
Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable
information for any secondary purposes. <br>
<br>
<b>Tell-A-Friend</b><br>
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's
name and email address.  4hb.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them
to visit the site.  4hb.com does not store this information and uses it only for the sole purpose
of sending this one-time email.<br>
<br>
<b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage,
and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it,
and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy
under which the information was collected.  <br>
