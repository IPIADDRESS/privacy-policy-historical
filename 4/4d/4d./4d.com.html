	<p>4D, Inc. is committed to your privacy. This statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site, including what kind of information is collected and tracked, and with whom this information is shared.</p>
	<h2>Collection of Personal Information</h2>
	<p>In general, you can visit the 4D and 4D WebSTAR Web sites without giving any information about yourself. A user’s visit is tracked with the logging of IP addresses and domain names, but the user remains anonymous. This process simply gives us an idea of where users are headed to within our site, and how long they remain there.</p>
	<p>There are certain activities where we will ask you to voluntarily provide information about yourself. Such activities include downloading beta releases, subscribing to announcements and/or mailing lists, and purchasing software products, upgrades, or books online from our 4D Store. For some activities, you may be asked to provide your name, e-mail address, postal address, and more information, if needed.</p>
	<p>For purchases from 4D Store, you are required to fill out certain fields in the order form that is primarily for 4D Store's internal use. Depending on 4D Store's contractual agreement with the publisher of the software you downloaded, 4D may provide your personal information to that publisher, not including your credit card information. Aside from providing this information to the publisher of the software you download, 4D does not and will not provide your personal information to any other party. You may choose to support or not to support registration for products you download from 4DStore.com.</p>
	<p>Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about our company to our customers. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Opt-Out/Modify/Delete section below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services.</p>
	<p>Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address) and demographic information (like their zip code, or age). We may use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Opt-Out/Modify/Delete section below.</p>
	<h2>Updating Your Personal Information</h2>
	<p>You have the right to access and correct your personal information and privacy preferences. This may be accomplished by either logging into your account on Partner Central or the 4D Store and accessing your information, or by writing to 4D, Inc.:</p>
