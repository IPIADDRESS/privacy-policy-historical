</ul>
<p>This privacy policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal information is collected and used through our websites and apps.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What Information Do We Collect from You?</strong></h3>

If you choose to register, you have the right to unsubscribe at any time by contacting us through one of the contact options provided below (email, letter, or telephone).&nbsp; Please give us a reasonable amount of time to process your unsubscribe request.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ordering</strong></h4>
<p>If you place an order through our websites or apps, such as an order for a ticket or season pass to one of our theme parks, we must obtain information from you relating to the order, including your contact information, payment information such as credit card number, billing and shipping information, order information, drivers license number, login information, preferences, user information, information about travel companions, and health information.&nbsp; This information is used for billing purposes, to fill and confirm customer orders, and to establish your season pass account which may include information about you that we may need to access should there be an emergency at one of our parks.&nbsp; The information may be used to contact you to confirm orders or in the event that we have trouble processing your order for a pass, newsletter or catalogue.&nbsp; Consistent with applicable laws and requirements, we retain order information to better serve you on future purchases, and may use your information to contact you in connection with other SeaWorld services that we believe may be of interest to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also share this information with third party services in order to process your payments.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Employment</strong></h4>
<p>If you apply for a job with SeaWorld or its affiliates through our websites, the information collected will include your qualifications for the position, your education, applicable licenses or certifications, prior job history, references, and any other information that you choose to include about yourself.&nbsp; If you are accepted for employment, we will, of course, necessarily collect other relevant information from you and include it with that collected during the application process, and include it in your personnel file.&nbsp; The information that will be collected for purposes of your employment includes your Social Security number.&nbsp; That information and other employee personal information are protected in accordance with SeaWorld’s internal policies.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Other</strong></h4>
<p>Occasionally, we may invite you to participate in a survey or poll such as providing feedback on our website site content, theme parks, services, or products.&nbsp; Your responses will be anonymous unless you choose to provide your contact details so that we can provide you with additional information regarding the survey or poll.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For any information that we collect through our sites, SeaWorld becomes the owner of that data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may engage third party services such as OpinionLab to collect feedback from you about your experience on our website.&nbsp; When you click on a feedback link, sometimes called a collection link, you are sharing information with both us and the third party feedback service.&nbsp; This may include your ratings of our website content, specific questions about our parks and services, and your comments and suggestions.&nbsp; You have the option of also including your email address.&nbsp; Such feedback is collected by the third party service and is provided to us for our internal use in analyzing customer use of our website and improving our parks, services and websites.&nbsp; We may also use your email address to contact you if you have a specific question or issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may collect certain information for fraud collection purposes.&nbsp; This includes mobile device identifier, IP address, information about your location, and various settings within your device.&nbsp; We do not associate this information with your name or other such personal information.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cookies and Other Anonymous Web Tracking Techniques </strong></h4>
<p>Like most websites, we use "cookies" on our websites to help us serve you better on future visits, and to help us analyze web traffic for our site, validate sessions, authenticate content of forms you fill out, and evaluate and improve the content or functions of our site.&nbsp; A cookie is a small text file which is sent by a website, accepted by a web browser, and then placed on your hard drive.&nbsp; The information collected from cookies sent by SeaWorld and approved third parties assisting us with our websites lets us know that you visited our sites in the past and helps you avoid having to re-enter information on each visit in order to use some of our products or services.&nbsp; Cookies also help us analyze use of our site, and better aggregate useful information when site users provide feedback about our sites or parks.&nbsp; You can always set your browser to refuse all cookies from this and other websites that you may visit.&nbsp; This will provide you with more control over the acceptance of cookies on your hard drive.&nbsp; However, it is possible that some portions of our websites will not function properly or may perform more slowly if you choose to reject cookies.&nbsp; By using our websites and not disabling cookies, you consent to allowing their use for the described purposes.&nbsp; Remember also that disabling cookies is browser specific.&nbsp; If you log on using Internet Explorer, you must also disable cookies in Safari if you use that browser at a different time.&nbsp; We may also collect information about your method of access such as your operating system (Windows 7, Windows 8, Mac, Linux, etc.) and your browser (Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Safari, etc).</p>
<p>When you visit one of our websites, we may automatically collect certain information from your computer or mobile device, such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), your IP address, the web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome and Firefox), UDID (for mobile devices), information about the websites visited before and after visiting our website, the web pages and advertisements viewed and links clicked on within our sites, interactions with e-mail messages sent by our websites or companies (e.g., links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), information collected through the use of unique identifiers such as cookie, information regarding the Internet service provider, and other standard server log information.</p>
<p>We may employ over time various different advertising or remarketing services that serve you targeted advertisements to make your online experience more focused to your interests.&nbsp; These services include, but are not limited to, collection of data through the DoubleClick cookie and through our implementation of Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager and AdWords. These tools and technologies collect and analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses, device and software identifiers, referring and exit URLs, onsite behavior and usage information, feature use metrics and statistics, usage and purchase history, MAC Address, mobile unique device ID, and other similar information.</p>
<p>We use the following Google Analytics features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display Advertising</li>
<li>Remarketing</li>
<li>Google Display Network Impression Reporting</li>
<li>Double Click Campaign Manager</li>
<li>Demographics and Interest Reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>You may opt-out of these interest-based ads on Google ads using Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads?hl=en&amp;sig=ACi0TCjJI2oo-qUWHHBAa50G7u_CWYSdZfkicrtJJnDzc8keVYJRXhblfpkhFb5y0sg_jhFxHp6FMqgB04buIHk_k5LcmjA5g2g7RlGJHbDzfUNJqgn4Mf5uIj6zB0sLdkn7yCKIzdVrv-JZz1P8T8sj_4Rsuj35DphZ8hptL3h9Mk9Whoe8Bs5pazJlcluS-y0penEXj6DT">Ads Settings</a> feature. You may also opt-out of other Google Analytics features using the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.</p>
<p>Remarketing allows us to serve you with an advertisement when you visit other websites after having visited one of our websites.&nbsp; This means that websites that are not controlled by us, including Google, will show our ads when you visit their websites.&nbsp; It also means that other advertisers, including Google, will show their advertisements on our website.&nbsp; You may opt-out of remarketing using <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads?hl=en&amp;sig=ACi0TCi-CzXGGmLgUcuvvAX_fww9Te0CdUqX1Znty1cat8Li4ViJvQR69Sw8QJAiREktix5FPwT_hARFQheavEQDE3X19iC5mbeU9H5R_tCgtSrD98Lu61Jq9JrjaP_w275cNbgmaL7_mBLNRbbtKPu1_pho7ChUBHTPWQ8GV2JjbzzH7I6w9tu-OhvTHwyaXT3c52adGz5h">Ads Settings</a> or at the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network Advertising Initiative's opt-out page</a>.</p>
<p>We will not run interest-based advertising campaigns that collect personally identifiable information (PII) including, but not limited to, email addresses, telephone numbers and credit card numbers.&nbsp; We will not use or associate personally identifiable information with remarketing lists, cookies, data feeds or other anonymous identifiers.&nbsp; We will not use or associate targeting information, such as demographics or location, with any personally identifiable information collected from the ad or its landing page(s).</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Social Platform Registrations and Social Media Plugins</strong></h4>
<p>Some of the SeaWorld websites permit you to use a third party social networking platform, such as Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter.&nbsp; This includes use of social media plugins such as Facebook “Like”, Tweet, and &nbsp;Pinterest “Pin,” buttons, etc., and links to services such as YouTube and Flickr. &nbsp;When you use these social networking platforms and plugins, your username and password for the services and other information available about you or collected from you on these services may be shared with us. &nbsp;Some plugins allow you to post specific content from our websites.&nbsp; For example, on the Antarctica<sup>®</sup> website, we use a Reach Buddy plugin to enable you to share your penguin type from the penguin quiz on your Facebook wall.&nbsp; When you take the quiz, a pop up appears that asks you for your Facebook account name and password.&nbsp; Although that information is not collected by SeaWorld, it is collected and used by Facebook for log in purposes through the Reach Buddy app.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please remember that when you enter your Facebook account name and password into social media apps like Reach Buddy (sometimes called sapplets), you are giving the app permission to post to your Facebook wall on your behalf.</p>
<p>When you use social networking platforms and plugins, you share your information with them and their privacy policy applies to the use and disclosure of such information.&nbsp; In addition, they may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on the SeaWorld websites, and they may notify your connections on the social networking platform about your use of the SeaWorld websites.&nbsp; Such services may allow your activity to be monitored across multiple websites for purposes of delivering more targeted advertising.&nbsp; Please note that their privacy policies may apply and we encourage you to read them.&nbsp; We may add new social networking plugins and buttons to our websites from time to time.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Apps</strong></h4>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy </strong></h3>
<p>The SeaWorld Kids website and some individual child oriented websites are subject to a separate Terms of Use and Privacy Policy available at <a href="http://www.seaworldkids.com/en/termsandconditions/">http://www.seaworldkids.com/en/termsandconditions/</a>.&nbsp; The SeaWorld websites that link to this Privacy Policy are not intended for use by children under the age of 13. Other than the sites referred to in the SeaWorld Kids Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, SeaWorld does not market any of its products online for children under the age of 13, nor does SeaWorld design its online applications, advertisements and other features to attract an audience of children under the age of 13.&nbsp; Although certain pages within the website may reference "kids," "children," or "students," SeaWorld strictly intends for such portions of the website to be used only by adults (such as parents and teachers) or children of the age 13 or older.&nbsp; SeaWorld adheres to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and does not knowingly register or otherwise collect personally identifiable information from any child under the age of 13 without the prior verifiable consent of the child's parent or guardian.&nbsp; However, we are allowed to collect personal information from a child for the one-time purpose of responding to an inquiry, answering an email, or seeking Verifiable Parental Consent at the request of the child under the age of 13.</p>
<p>SeaWorld does not sell or share information obtained from minors with any third parties for their own use.&nbsp; The third parties who may have access are those assisting us with or co-sponsoring our website fulfillments, such as for purposes of filling orders or processing payments.&nbsp; We do not share a child's information with blogs or other sites where the information would be publically accessible.&nbsp; We may collect limited information for a one time contact, such as verifying your birth date for the Florida Fun Card activation.&nbsp; In such a situation, we do not keep the information nor disclose it or use it for any other purpose.</p>
<p>If SeaWorld should inadvertently collect information from a child under the age of 13, we delete that information, except to the extent needed to seek Verifiable Parental Consent from the minor's parent or legal guardian.&nbsp; When Verifiable Parental Consent is obtained, we collect only that personal information from a minor that is relevant to the registration or purchase.&nbsp; We protect the information with security safeguards and confidentiality measures that are commensurate with the sensitivity of the information.&nbsp; Parents or legal guardians have the right to review their child's personal information, delete it, or withdraw permission to allow further collection or use of that information.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Parental Submission of Personal Information of Children</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While SeaWorld does not collect information directly from children, we do allow parents to submit certain limited information about their children on the SeaWorld Parents website at <a href="http://www.seaworldkids.com/en/gennature/takeaction/parents/">http://www.seaworldkids.com/en/gennature/takeaction/parents/</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SeaWorld allows parents to sign up for email mailing lists that may contain information and activities that are useful for children. &nbsp;Emails subscribed to from the SeaWorld Parents page are sent directly to the parent and it is up to the parent to share with their children.&nbsp; Children may subscribe to emails directly on the SeaWorld Kids websites using the provided link under a limited exception to the verifiable parental consent requirement.&nbsp; This link requires the child to submit both the child's and the parent's email address.&nbsp; We then send an email to the parent who has an opportunity to opt-out of the newsletter for their child.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SeaWorld also allows parents to link to or embed pictures and videos of their children under the age of 13 from social media websites such as Facebook, Instagram and YouTube to SeaWorld.
