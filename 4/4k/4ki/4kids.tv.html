We use information we collect about others only to enable the User of our Website to communicate with those other Users that they have listed as "friends" (e.g. sending them e-mails or game challenges).<br><br>
B. 4Kids currently does not disclose personally identifiable information to third parties that Users provide, except from time to time we may transfer, disclose or share such information with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle and deliver certain online activities (e.g. conducting contests and sweepstakes). Such third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Additionally, in the event that all, or substantially all, of the assets relating to 4Kids.tv are transferred or sold to another entity, personally identifiable information submitted to us may be transferred to the acquiring entity.

				<div class="text">4Kids has a special Privacy Policy for Users under the age of 13.   We urge children to check with their parents or guardians before entering information on any website, and we urge parents and guardians to discuss this Special Privacy Policy with their children, including restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know.<br><br>
A. 4Kids does not collect personally identifiable information about any User under 13, including, without limitation, names and e-mail addresses without (x) notifying the parent via e-mail and giving the parent or guardian the option to remove their child's e-mail address and any other information pertaining to the child from the applicable database for that activity or (y) obtaining verifiable consent from that child's parent or guardian. A parent or guardian may permit a User under 13 to participate in activities on our Website without consenting to the disclosure of the User under 13's personally identifiable information to third parties. Generally, personally identifiable information is collected only during activities such as:
<ol>
<li>4Kids.tv registrations</li>
<li>Contest or sweepstakes registrations</li> 
<li>Subscription registrations</li>
<li>Online shopping </li>
<li>4Kids.tv User profile; and </li>
<li>Refer a friend.</li>
</ol>
B.    4Kids will obtain such verifiable consent from a parent or guardian of a User under 13 before the User will be permitted to register for an account on 4Kids.tv.  When registering the User is asked to provide his/her age, email address and the email address for his/her parent or guardian. 4Kids sends an email to the parent or guardian notifying the parent or guardian that the User under 13 has begun the registration process.  The email from 4Kids will contain a link back to the Website where the parent or guardian can grant the User under 13 permission to complete registration.  The parent or guardian will also receive a separate password to access, review and modify their child’s account and Profile provided via email. Once approved, an email is sent to both parent and the User confirming the completion of registration. The User will then have the ability to: (1) create a 4Kids.tv profile, (2) add friends to his/her 4Kids.tv profile, (3) chat using pre-set, canned messages throughout the 4Kids.tv site, (4) email within the Website to other Users using pre-set, canned messages, (5) chat on moderated message boards and (6) challenge other Users to online games.  The parent or guardian who wishes to modify, correct, update or delete their User under 13’s registration information or 4Kids.tv profile can log onto their child’s account at http://www.4kids.tv/user/account.  Their child’s account can be modified from the User’s 4Kids.tv account page or deleted by clicking "delete account" under the control panel option. Upon deletion of a User’s account, access to all membership, communities, avatar privileges and 4Kids.tv rewards points will be lost.  Parents or guardians always have the option of calling us at 1-212-590-2100 or e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@4kids.tv">webmaster@4kids.tv</a>  with any questions or problems with regards to consent.<br><br>
C.  4Kids will not request from any User under 13, nor does 4Kids condition the participation of any User under 13 in any activity on the Website, the collection of, or disclosure by the User under 13 of more personal information than is reasonably required for such User under 13 to participate in such contest or activity. For example, for sweepstakes and contests, only e-mail addresses are collected for the purpose of entering the online sweepstakes or contest on a one-time basis and are used to notify winners and winners’ parents directly of the sweepstakes or contest once by e-mail. Notification and prizes will be sent to the User under 13's parent or guardian. All emails collected are deleted upon completion and fulfillment of the sweepstakes or contest.<br><br>
D.   For some activities, such as online polls, surveys, game challenges and message boards, we may ask a User under 13 to provide information that is not personally identifiable. This might include the User's first name only, user name, state of residence, age, gender, or favorite 4Kids TV character.<br><br>
E.  For any periodic newsletters offered by our Website, we collect a User’s e-mail address, and his/her parent or guardian's e-mail address. We then send an e-mail notification to the parent asking permission. If the parent wishes to deny permission for the child's receipt of any newsletter from the Website, the parent or guardian simply needs to click on the hyperlink to unsubscribe.  A parent or User can, at any time, be removed from the newsletter mailing list by following the instructions at the bottom of the newsletter. If such a removal request is made (or if the parent denies permission from the outset), any personal information collected for the newsletter subscription is deleted from our database.<br><br>
F.  For other activities, such as sending an electronic postcard or e-mail to a friend, we may also ask for personal information about other people. This is usually limited to a first name and e-mail address. E-mail addresses collected to send an electronic postcard or e-mail to a friend are deleted when the requested postcard or e-mail is transmitted.<br><br>
G. 4Kids keeps any personally identifiable information we obtain through a contest or sweepstakes only until we have successfully selected the winner(s), awarded the prize(s), and completed the administration of the contest or sweepstakes as legally required; and such information will not be used for any other purpose. We will not publish the names, ages, images or other personally identifiable information of any contest winner under 13 without first obtaining the consent of such contest winner's parent or guardian. <br><br>
H.  The e-mail address of a User under 13 is never posted on the Website. No personally identifying information should be submitted to, or posted at, the Website by any User under 13 years of age without the consent of such User's parent or guardian. <br><br>
I.  We will disclose information that we maintain as required by law, such as, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose such information in response to a specific law enforcement agency's request.

				 The Website never uses cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, the Website does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes; nor is that information shared with any unaffiliated third parties. The Website does not use cookies to identify specific individuals, except in such cases as online shopping (see above), sweepstakes and contest registration (where a cookie may allow you to enter a contest without registering again each time). <br><br>
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some areas of the Website, such as any shopping, contest, and game area, may not function properly if you set your computer to refuse cookies.
