<p>Privacy Policy </p>
<p>We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this 
  policy sets out how we will treat your personal information. </p>
<p>(1) What information do we collect?</p>
<p>We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:</p>
<p>[(a) information about your computer and about your visits to and use of this 
  website (including [your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral 
  source, length of visit and number of page views]);]</p>
<p>[(b) information relating to any transactions carried out between you and us 
  on or in relation to this website, including information relating to any purchases 
  you make of our goods or services (including [DETAILS]);]</p>
<p>[(c) information that you provide to us for the purpose of registering with

<p>[(f) OTHER INFORMATION.] </p>
<p>[(2) Cookies </p>
<p>A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and 
  stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each 
  time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server 
  to identify and track the web browser. </p>
<p>We [may] use [both] [“session” cookies] [and “persistent” 
  cookies] on the website. [We will use the session cookies to: keep track of 
  you whilst you navigate the website; and [OTHER USES].] [We will use the persistent 
  cookies to: enable our website to recognise you when you visit; [OTHER USES].] 
</p>
<p>[Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser.] 
  [Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until 
  they reach a specified expiry date.]</p>
<p>[We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website. Google Analytics 
  generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, 
  which are stored on users' computers. The information generated relating to 
  our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will 
  store this information. Google's privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html.] 
</p>
<p>[Our [advertisers/payment services providers] may also send you cookies.] </p>
<p>[We publish Google Adsense interest-based advertisements on our website. These 
  are tailored by Google to reflect your interests. To determine your interests, 
  Google will track your behaviour across the web using cookies. You can view, 
  delete or add interest categories associated with your browser using Google's 
  Ads Preference Manager, available at: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/. 
  You can opt-out of the Adsense partner network cookie at: http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html. 
  However, this opt-out mechanism uses a cookie, and if you clear the cookies 
  from your browser your opt-out will not be maintained. To ensure that an opt-out 
  is maintained in respect of a particular browser, you should use the Google 
  browser plug-in available at: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin.] 
</p>
<p>Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you 
  to reject just third party cookies. For example, in Internet Explorer you can 
  refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, 
  “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the 
  sliding selector. Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact 
  upon the usability of many websites[, including this one].]</p>
