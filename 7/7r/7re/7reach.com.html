			<b>7REACH MEDIA, LLC, and each of its related web sites (�7Reach 
			Media�) Privacy Policy</b><br>
			Last updated January 14, 2009.<br>
			<br>
			This Privacy Policy outlines important information regarding the use 
			and disclosure of information collected via this Website.&nbsp; 7Reach 
			Media provides this Privacy Policy to help users make an informed 
			decision as to whether to use or continue using the Website.<br>
			<br>
			PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND 
			CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR 
			UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. 
			7REACH MEDIA DOES NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER 
			THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB SITE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE 
			WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY 
			INFORMATION TO 7REACH MEDIA OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS 
			OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES REFERRED IN THIS PRIVACY 
			POLICY.<br>
			<br>
			This Privacy Policy applies to 7Reach Media�s collection, use, 
			storage and disclosure of information by 7Reach Media on its (a) 
			websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related 
			companies (collectively, the �Website�), (b) on various third party 
			websites, and (c) to 7Reach Media�s other information collection, 
			including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. 7Reach 
			Media is not responsible for the information collection or privacy 
			practices of third web sites or applications.<br>
			By reference, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is 
			subject to the Website Terms of Use. Your use of the Website and any 
			personal information you provide via the Website or through other 
			official 7Reach Media contact remains subject to this Privacy Policy, 
			as well as the Terms of Use and/or other stated policies.<br>
			<br>
			<b>1. Collection of Information.</b><br>
			<b>1.1 Survey Information.</b><br>
			7Reach Media collects information from individuals by various 
			methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual 
			voluntarily completes an 7Reach Media survey, order form, or a 
			registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or 
			offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by 
			third parties (collectively, a �Survey�). (As used herein, �online� 
			means using the Internet, including the Website, and related 
			technologies, and �offline� means by methods other than online, 
			including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell 
			phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, 7Reach Media or a 
			third party (a �Third Party�) may ask an individual to provide 
			various information to 7Reach Media, which may include his or her 
			name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers 
			(including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details 
			(e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, 
			gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, 
			social security number, employment information, personal and online 
			interests, and such other information as may be requested from time 
			to time (together, �Survey Information�). 7Reach Media may also 
			collect information concerning an individual from another source and 
			use that information in combination with information provided from 
			this Web Site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and 
			individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to 
			7Reach Media or Third Party, but an individual may receive 
			incentives from 7Reach Media or a Third Party in exchange for 
			providing Survey Information to 7Reach Media.<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.2 Third Party List Information.</b><br>
			7Reach Media collects information from individuals when an 
			individual provides information to a Third Party and 7Reach Media 
			subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the 
			information from the Third Party (the �Seller�). Such purchased 
			information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's 
			name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers 
			(including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details 
			(e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, 
			gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, 
			industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such 
			other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller 
			(together, �Third Party List Information�). When acquiring Third 
			Party List Information, 7Reach Media seeks assurances from the 
			Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List 
			Information to 7Reach Media and that the Seller has a right to 
			provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal 
			information is included on the Seller's list.<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.3 Other Information.</b><br>
			Other occasions when 7Reach Media obtains information from 
			individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a 
			prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by 7Reach Media or 
			by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through 
			7Reach Media�s customer service department, and (3) when an 
			individual voluntarily subscribes to a 7Reach Media service or 
			newsletter (together, �Other Information�).<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using 
			Technology.</b><br>
			7Reach Media currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to 
			associate certain Internet-related information about an individual 
			with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, 
			7Reach Media may use other new and evolving sources of information 
			in the future (together, �Technology Information�).<br>
			<b>(a) Cookies.&nbsp; </b>A cookie is a small amount of data stored on 
			the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows 7Reach Media 
			to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that 
			resides in 7Reach Media�s database. You may read more about cookies 
			at </span>
			<a target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.mediabreakaway.com/www./cookiecentral.com">
			<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">
			http://cookiecentral.com</span></a><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">. 
			Individuals who use the Website need to accept cookies in order to 
			use all of the features and functionality of the Website.<br>
			<b>(b) Web Beacons.&nbsp; </b>A web beacon is programming code that can 
			be used to display an image on a web page (by using an &lt;img src=�x�&gt; 
			programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), 
			but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user 
			identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and 
			associate the individual with previously acquired information about 
			an individual in a database. This allows 7Reach Media to track 
			certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used 
			to determine products or services an individual may be interested 
			in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. 
			For example, 7Reach Media might place, with the consent of a Third 
			Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where 
			baseball products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in 7Reach 
			Media�s database, visits the fishing website, 7Reach Media receives 
			notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the baseball 
			site, and 7Reach Media would then update Joe's profile with the 
			information that Joe is interested in baseball. 7Reach Media may 
			thereafter present offers of baseball related products and services 
			to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, 7Reach Media 
			also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed 
			in 7Reach Media�s database.<br>
			<b>(c) New Technology.&nbsp; </b>The use of technology on the Internet, 
			including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is 7Reach 
			Media�s use of new and evolving technology. As a result, 7Reach 
			Media strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any 
			updates regarding its use of technology.<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.5 Outside Information.</b><br>
			7Reach Media may receive information about individuals from Third 
			Parties or from other sources of information outside of 7Reach Media 
			including information located in public databases (�Outside 
			Information�).<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.6 Individual Information.</b><br>
			As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, 
			Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology 
			Information, and Outside Information, and any other information 
			7Reach Media gathers or receives about individuals such as usage 
			data, file transfer and viewing data.<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.7 No Information Collected from Children.</b><br>
			7Reach Media will never knowingly collect any personal information 
			about children under the age of 13. If 7Reach Media obtains actual 
			knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child 
			under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted 
			from our database. Because it does not collect such information, 
			7Reach Media has no such information to use or to disclose to Third 
			Parties. 7Reach Media has designed this policy in order to comply 
			with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (�COPPA�).<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.8 Credit Card Information.</b><br>
			7Reach Media may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and 
			related information, such as the expiration date of the card 
			(�Credit Card Information�) when an individual places an order from 
			7Reach Media. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to 
			7Reach Media, such information is encrypted and is protected with 
			SSL encryption software. 7Reach Media will use the Credit Card 
			Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase 
			transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to 
			Third Parties only as necessary to complete the purchase 
			transaction.<br>
			Log File Data: When users log-in to access their account, our 
			servers will automatically record and archive certain information 
			that web-browsers send whenever visiting a Website. These server 
			logs may include information vital to validating the user�s 
			authorization to access the account. Information, such as a Web 
			request, Internet Protocol (the �IP�) address, browser type, browser 
			language, referring pages, exit pages and visited URLs, platform 
			type, click counts, pages viewed and in what order, time spent, the 
			date and time of the request, and other important data is necessary 
			to validate and authorize a user�s entry and activity on the 
			Website.<br>
			<br>
			<b>2. Use of Individual Information.</b><br>
			<b>2.1 Discretion to Use Information.</b><br>
			THE COMPANY MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY 
			PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION.<br>
			The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how 7Reach Media 
			currently uses Individual Information, but 7Reach Media may change 
			or broaden its use at any time. As noted, 7Reach Media may update 
			this policy from time to time. 7Reach Media may use Individual 
			Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of 
			email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, 
			online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other 
			possible uses.<br>
			<br>
			<b>2.2 Email.</b><br>
			7Reach Media uses Individual Information to provide promotional 
			offers by email to individuals. 7Reach Media may maintain separate 
			email lists for different purposes. If email recipients wish to end 
			their email subscription from a particular list, they need to follow 
			the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe 
			from the particular list. To unsubscribe from all 7Reach Media�s 
			email lists, a person must send an email to remove@7reach.com.<br>
			<b>2.2(a) Content of Email Messages.</b><br>
			In certain commercial email messages sent by 7Reach Media, an 
			advertiser's name will appear in the �From:� line but hitting the 
			�Reply� button will cause a reply email to be sent to 7Reach Media. 
			The �Subject:� line of 7Reach Media email messages will usually 
			contain a line provided from the advertiser to 7Reach Media.<br>
			<b>2.2(b) Solicited Email.</b><br>
			7Reach Media only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the 
			Website to receive email from 7Reach Media or to individuals who 
			have agreed on Third Party websites to receive email from Third 
			Parties such as 7Reach Media. 7Reach Media does not send unsolicited 
			email messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting 
			for unsolicited email are not applicable to 7Reach Media�s email 
			messages.<br>
			<br>
			<b>2.3 Targeted Advertising.</b><br>
			7Reach Media uses Individual Information to target advertising to an 
			individual. When an individual is using the Internet, 7Reach Media 
			uses Technology Information (see also Section 2.5 below) to 
			associate an individual with that person's Individual Information, 
			and 7Reach Media attempts to show advertising for products and 
			services in which the person has expressed an interest in the 
			Surveys, indicated an interest by means of Technology Information, 
			and otherwise. 7Reach Media may, at its discretion, target 
			advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, 
			and other means of communication to provide promotional offers.<br>
			<br>
			<b>2.4 Direct Mail and Telemarketing.</b><br>
			7Reach Media uses Individual Information to advertise, directly or 
			indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or 
			telemarketing using telephones and cell phones.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><b>
			<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">
			2.5&nbsp; Mobile Phone SMS Messaging.</span></b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><br>
			In certain cases, when requested by an individual, a Third Party may 
			use Individual Information to provide customized content and 
			advertising via SMS messaging to an individual�s cell phone.&nbsp; 7Reach 
			Media is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of 
			such Third Parties.&nbsp; <br>
			<br>
			<b>2.6 Use of Technology Information.</b><br>
			7Reach Media uses Technology Information (1) to match a person's 
			Survey Information and Third Party List Information to other 
			categories of Individual Information to make and improve profiles of 
			individuals, (2) to track a person's online browsing habits on the 
			Internet, (3) to determine which areas of 7Reach Media�s web sites 
			are most frequently visited. This information helps 7Reach Media to 
			better understand the online habits of individuals so that 7Reach 
			Media can target advertising and promotions to them.<br>
			<br>
			<b>2.7 Profiles of Individuals.</b><br>
			7Reach Media uses Individual Information to make a profile of an 
			individual. A profile can be created by combining Survey Information 
			and Third Party List Information with other sources of Individual 
			Information such as information obtained from public databases.<br>
			<br>
			<b>2.8 Storage of Individual Information</b>.<br>
			7Reach Media stores the Individual Information in a database on 
			7Reach Media computers. Our computers have security measures (such 
			as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and 
			alteration of the information under 7Reach Media�s control. Not 
			withstanding such measures, 7Reach Media cannot guarantee that its 
			security measures will prevent 7Reach Media computers from being 
			illegally accessed, and the Individual Information on them stolen or 
			altered.<br>
			<br>
			<b>3. Dissemination of Individual Information.</b><br>
			<b>3.1 Sale or Transfer to Third Parties.</b><br>
			7Reach Media MAY SELL OR TRANSFER INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION TO THIRD 
			PARTIES FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN 7REACH MEDIA�S SOLE 
			DISCRETION.<br>
			<br>
			<b>3.2 Order Fulfillment.</b><br>
			7Reach Media will transfer Individual Information to Third Parties 
			when necessary to provide a product or service that a person orders 
			from such Third Party while using 7Reach Media web sites or when 
			responding to offers provided by 7Reach Media.<br>
			<br>
			<b>3.3 Legal Process.</b><br>
			7Reach Media may disclose Individual Information to respond to 
			subpoenas, court orders, and other legal processes.<br>
			<br>
			<b>3.4 Summary Data.</b><br>
			7Reach Media may sell or transfer non-individualized information, 
			such as summary or aggregated anonymous information about all 
			persons or sub-groups of persons.<br>
			<br>
			<b>3.5 Access.</b><br>
			Individuals have access to their Individual Information collected to 
			provide an opportunity for an individual to correct, amend, or 
			delete such information. Access can be obtained by contacting 
			info@7reach.com. 7Reach Media may also grant advertising clients and 
			email services providers� access to an individual's email address to 
			verify the origin of the Individual Information collected.<br>
			<br>
			<b>4. Privacy Practices of Third Parties.</b><br>
			<b>4.1 Advertiser cookies and web beacons.</b><br>
			Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies 
			(together, �Advertisers�) who place advertisements on the Website 
			and on the Internet generally may use their own cookies, web 
			beacons, and other technology to collect information about 
			individuals. 7Reach Media does not control Advertisers' use of such 
			technology and 7Reach Media has no responsibility for the use of 
			such technology to gather information about individuals.<br>
			<br>
			<b>4.2 Links.</b><br>
			The Website and email messages sometimes contain hypertext links to 
			the web sites of Third Parties. 7Reach Media is not responsible for 
			the privacy practices or the content of such other web sites. Linked 
			web sites may contain links to web sites maintained by Third 
			Parties. Such links are provided for your convenience and reference 
			only. 7Reach Media does not operate or control in any respect any 
			information, software, products or services available on such Third 
			Party web sites. The inclusion of a link to a web site does not 
			imply any endorsement of the services or the site, its contents, or 
			its sponsoring organization.<br>
			<br>
			<b>4.3 Affiliated Companies.</b><br>
			7Reach Media may disclose, transfer, and sell Individual Information 
			to entities affiliated with 7Reach Media in 7Reach Media�s 
			discretion.&nbsp; Should 7Reach Media be subject to an acquisition, 
			merger, sale or other change of control or business entity status, 
			7Reach Media reserves the right to transfer or assign the 
			Information collected from the Website.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
