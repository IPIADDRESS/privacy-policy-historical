    				<p>We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order.  <strong>We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order</strong>. </p>
                    
                    <p>We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery.  We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.</p>
                    
                    <p>We offer gift-cards by which you can personalize a product you order for another person.  Information you provide to us to create a gift-card is only used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person receiving the gift.</p>

                    <p>When you register some of our software programs (such as <a href="http://www.dwuser.com/easyrotator/">EasyRotator</a>), we ask for information such as your name and email address.

We only send you email containing content we believe you will genuinely value, find useful, and appreciate.  We hate spam; we'd never dream of spamming you.  Your information is NEVER shared with outside parties.</p>

					<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.</p>

	<a name="5"></a><h4>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</h4>

					<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.  For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>

					<p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging in using your DWUser.com Account at <a href="/myaccount/">http://www.dwuser.com/myaccount/</a> . We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.</p>

					<p>You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.</p>
                    
                    <p>To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>
