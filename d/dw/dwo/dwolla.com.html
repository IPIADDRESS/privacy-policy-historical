<h3>What security precautions does Dwolla take to protect me?</h3>

<p>We have security measures in place to protect your personal information, including the use of industry-standard encryption technology and internal policies and restrictions regarding the storage of and access to your personal information.</p>

<p>Your Dwolla account information and profile are encrypted and password protected so that you are the only one who has access to your personal information. You can edit your account information and profile by using your logon name and password. We recommend that you follow these guidelines to protect yourself:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Do not tell anyone your password. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.</li>
<li>Do not respond to unsolicited e-mail by giving your password, even if the e-mail claims to be from us. Dwolla will never ask you for your password in this way.</li>
<li>When you are done using the Dwolla site, sign out of your account and close your browser window.</li>
</ul>

<p>No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Providing personal information to Dwolla is done at your own risk.</p>

<p>When you enter sensitive information on our forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

<h3>What are cookies and how does Dwolla use them?</h3>

<p>Part of our customized service involves using “cookies” so that we can immediately recognize you, determine when you – or someone using the same browser you previously used – revisits Dwolla, and to provide a more personalized experience. A "cookie" is a chunk of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored by your browser on the hard drive of your computer. Your browser settings must be set to accept cookies before you can login or customize. Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to refuse them. Dwolla does not use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer.  We do not link the information we store on cookies to any personal information you submit while on our site other than as disclosed below. </p>

<p>Dwolla uses cookies to:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Locate your name and account information when you log in to our Web site so that you can access your account information. When you log in, the cookie is set, and when you sign-out, the cookie is modified.</li>
<li>Estimate the size of our audience. Each browser that accesses Dwolla is given a unique cookie, which is used to calculate how many people return to our Web site, compare the number of registered and unregistered visitors to our site, and use customer interests and behavior to target our advertisements.</li>
<li>Help Dwolla partners track visits and complete business transactions. This information is sometimes called "clickstream" or "click trail".</li>
<li>Track the way you use our promotions, contests, and sales. When a Dwolla-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie tracks the user's progress through the promotion (for example, entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings).</li>
<li>Measure the traffic to various areas of the Dwolla site. We measure the areas of the network of Web sites you visit and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. This research helps us understand the ways in which our customers are alike and the ways in which they differ. We may use this information to personalize the information and design in our Web site.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can make decisions about cookies. You can modify your browser preferences to accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you decide to reject all cookies, you might not be able to access certain areas of the Dwolla website or participate in Dwolla services that require registration to participate.</p>

<p>The use of third party cookies are not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>

<p><strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong></p>

<p>We employ or our third party tracking utility partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. </p>

<p><strong>How do I update my Information?</strong></p>
