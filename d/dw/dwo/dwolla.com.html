<h4>Last Updated: January 10, 2017</h4>
<p>Dwolla, Inc. (“Dwolla”) is committed to protecting your privacy and earning your trust. This Privacy Policy discloses our privacy practices for personal information we collect when you use or access our products, services, features, or content through any website, application, or service (“Dwolla Services”), even if you have not opened a Dwolla account or visited our websites <a href="https://www.dwolla.com" title="Dwolla">www.dwolla.com</a>, <a href="https://www.dwollalabs.com" title="Dwolla labs">www.dwollalabs.com</a>, or our mobile application (“Dwolla Sites”).

If we make any material change, we will notify you by email (as listed in your account profile) or by means of a notice on <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/legal/privacy" title="Dwolla privacy policy">www.dwolla.com/legal/privacy</a> prior to the change becoming effective.</p>

To update or delete your testimonial, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@dwolla.com" title="Privacy at Dwolla">privacy@dwolla.com</a>.</li>
<li>Email and/or phone number for your contacts that you enter into Dwolla payment flows. We use this information to notify your contacts that you have sent them a payment and/or payment request.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also collect the following information from your device when you use the Dwolla Services, including your mobile device when you use our mobile application: your IP address, the type of device you use, your device identifier, your operating system version, the type of browser you use, your location, and the URL that you came from and the next URL that you visit.</p>
<p>If you enable location-based services in the mobile application, Dwolla will collect your location-based information in order to show you places that you search for on a map. We will only share this information with our mapping provider for the sole purpose of providing you this service. You can turn off location-based services at any time by editing your settings at the device level.</p>
<p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile application. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. &nbsp;We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you in order to provide and improve the Dwolla Services.</p>
<h3>How does Dwolla use the personal information that it collects?</h3>

<li>With third parties to provide, maintain, and improve the Dwolla Services, including fraud prevention, identity verification, analytics and marketing services, and financial institutions and other partners that are part of the payment process. &nbsp;These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</li>
<li>With third parties upon your request. For example, you may ask Dwolla to confirm your status as a Dwolla user with a third party merchant.</li>
<li>If we believe disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or government request; to investigate or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our rights, our terms and conditions, or the rights of others; or to protect the safety and security of Dwolla, our users, or the public.</li>
<li>With a third party if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our stock or assets. If this occurs, you will be notified of any change to this Privacy Policy, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</li>

</ul>
<p>Other than as stated in this Privacy Policy, Dwolla does not disclose or sell any of your personal information to third parties without your consent.

<h3>How does Dwolla use cookies and web beacons?</h3>
<p>Dwolla and its marketing, analytics and fraud prevention service providers use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about Dwolla’s user base, and we may receive such information on an individual and aggregated basis from such providers.</p>
<p>We use cookies to provide you with a personalized experience by recognizing you when you return to the Dwolla Sites; better understand our users by tracking how they use the Dwolla Services; improve the design and content of the Dwolla Sites by tracking how users interact with the Dwolla Sites; and identify and prevent fraudulent activity. You can change your browser settings to refuse cookies, but this may interfere with your use of the Dwolla Sites.</p>
<p>We gather certain information about our website visitors automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you in order to provide and improve the Dwolla Services.</p>
<p>We may partner with a third party to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this website and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you do not want this information to be used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" title="TRUSTe Preference Manager">here</a>. This does not opt you out of being served ads and you will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
<p>We use Local Shared Objects, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website also use Flash cookies and HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

<p>The Dwolla Sites include social media features that allow you to “Like” or share content on third party sites. These features may be hosted by the third party sites or the Dwolla Sites, and may collect your IP address, the Dwolla Site page you are visiting, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function. This Privacy Policy does not apply to third party cookies, web beacons, social media features and widgets (such as the Facebook Like button), or other tracking technologies used by third parties. Dwolla is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third parties.</p>
