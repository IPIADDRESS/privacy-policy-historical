All information collected on that site is owned and controlled by that company’s privacy statement.</p> <h3>Links to Other Sites:</h3> <p>If you click on a link to a third party site, (including on an advertisement), you will leave our Sites and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as DMi.
