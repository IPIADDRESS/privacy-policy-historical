					<h2>Collected Information</h2>
					
					<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
					<p>Although you may generally use our Site without providing us with any personally identifiable information, 
					for some Site applications or services, we may collect certain types of personally identifiable information, including: name, 
					postal address, e-mail addresses, birth date, and phone number. This type of information is only collected from you voluntarily; 
					we will never gather or store such information without your knowledge and consent.  Examples of where we might gather such information from you: 
					when you sign up to receive e-mail updates or newsletters about the Site, our products, or services; to allow you to register or 
					update your individual profile on the Site; to help personalize the Site for you; or to allow you to provide feedback, or ask a question. 
					In some situations, you will need to provide some or all of the above-described personally identifiable information in order for certain 
					personalized features of the Site to function properly (e.g., company and product email alerts).</p>
					
					<p>We may use such information to contact you about our products, company or other related marketing or promotional purposes.</p>
					<p>We do not share personally identifiable information collected at this Site with third parties, except for the limited instances noted below. The exceptions are:</p>

					
					<ul class="bullets">
					<li>We may share your information with our agents who assist us in administering the Site and various programs and promotions. 
					They can only use the information to administer our Site, services, and products.  These agents are required to keep your information private and secure.</li>
					<li>If you opt-in (either at the time of providing personally identifiable information, or at a later time) to have us share your information 
					with our partners for the purpose of receiving information from our partners and other companies.</li>
					<li>We may also disclose personally identifiable information if we are required to comply with laws, or if in our 
					good faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to any claims, 
					or to protect the rights of dayriffer.com, its customers and the public.</li>
					<li>In the event of an acquisition of all or part of dayriffer.com by another company, or 
					in the event that dayriffer.com was to sell or dispose of all or a part of its business, 
					the acquirer would have access to the information maintained by dayriffer.com, which could include personally 
					identifiable information, subject to applicable law. Similarly, information may be transferred as part of a reorganization or insolvency proceeding.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>We may on occasion combine information we receive with outside records or Site usage information to enhance our consumer 
					profiles for our own marketing and development purposes (in accordance with this Privacy Policy).</p>

					
					<p>Although we use reasonable efforts to maintain the privacy of your personally identifiable data and information, 
					due to technological limitations, and the risk of unlawful interceptions and accessing of transmissions and/or data, 
					we cannot completely assure you, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable data and information, and any 
					other electronically communicated information, will be absolutely confidential.</p>
					
					<h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
					<p>We also collect and store non-personally identifiable information, such as visitor traffic, 
					page hits, Site referral information, browser information, downloads, and general Site use information through typical 
					Internet data collection tools, such as web beacons, cookies, and embedded web links.</p>
					
					<p>This Site may use cookie and tracking technology.  A "cookie" is a tiny file that your browser 
					places on your computer's hard drive, which acts to identify your computer.  Cookie and cookie tracking technology 
					is useful for gathering information such as browser type and operating system, tracking the number of visitors to the Site, 
					and understanding how visitors use the Site.  Cookies can also help tailor the Site to visitors' needs and help customize 
					the Site for visitors.  For example, we may use cookies to store your Site preferences, usage patterns, and other information 
					so that the Site will function better for you on subsequent visits.  The Site may also use cookies to deliver content specific 
					to your interests and for other similar purposes.  Personally identifiable information cannot be collected via cookies and other 
					tracking technology; however, if you previously provided personally identifiable information (as discussed above), cookies may be 
					tied to such information. Aggregated cookie and tracking information may be shared with third parties. 
					If you choose to reject the Site's cookies, some areas of the Site may not function properly or may not be accessible.</p>
					
					<h3>Automatically Collected Log Information</h3>
					<p>In addition to the information discussed above, when you visit the site we may collect and store the following information 
					in our logs for each browser request. We may use such information for development and marketing purposes (we will not use IP 
					addresses externally except as set forth above):</p>
