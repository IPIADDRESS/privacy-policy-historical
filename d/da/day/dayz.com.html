We use this to notify you about new features on the site, ask your opinion, and tell you about services you might not be using yet. Generally you'll get a newsletter about once every four weeks. <br>If you decide you no longer want to receive these newsletters all you need to do is change your setting under your <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;My Profile&gt;</span>. <br><br>2. The information we gather and track <br><br>When you register on dayzee, you provide your name (including a previous name, where relevant), one or more email addresses (each is registered) and some optional notes about yourself ("Registration Information").
