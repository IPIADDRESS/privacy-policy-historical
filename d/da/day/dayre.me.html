                    <ul>
                        <li>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content, including photos, videos, location data, comments and other materials ("User Content"), to the Service and to share User Content publicly.

                </div>
                <div class="bottom-content">
                    <h3>1.Information we collect</h3>
                    <p>We require your personal data for the purpose of your subscription to Dayre, the provision of the Service and or the activities that Dayre may organize, such as, free gifts, lucky draws and others.</p>

                    <p>We collect the following types of information.</p>

                    <p class="nomargin"><b>Information you provide us directly:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Dayre account.</li>
                        <li>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Dayre.</li>
                        <li>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</li>
                        <li>Communications between you and Dayre. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="nomargin"><b>Analytics information:</b></p>
                    <p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure and track usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.</p>

                    <p class="nomargin"><b>Cookies and similar technologies:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Dayre and provide features to you.</li>
                        <li>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="nomargin"><b>Log file information:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.</li>
                        <li>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="nomargin"><b>Device identifiers:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Dayre.</li>
                        <li>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you  browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="nomargin"><b>Metadata:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.</li>
                        <li>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is   made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>2. How we use your information</h3>

                    <p class="nomargin"><b>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</b></p>
