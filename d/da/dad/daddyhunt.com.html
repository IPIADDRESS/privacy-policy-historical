    <h3>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h3>

    <p>DH Services, LLC (“Daddyhunt”) takes your privacy seriously.  This Privacy Policy applies to any use of the Daddyhunt website ("Website"), Daddyhunt mobile device software application ("App") and any other related websites, blogs, mobile device software applications or other services or applications ("Other Services") owned or operated by Daddyhunt (collectively, the “Network”). We have prepared this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to describe to you our practices regarding the information we collect from users of the Network.  </p>


    <h3>CONSENT</h3>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, protect, use and share information about you when you use the Network.  This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Daddyhunt Terms of Service located at http://www.daddyhunt.com/terms .  By accessing the Network you acknowledge that you have read and you consent to the Privacy Policy and that we may collect, use and disclose information we collect in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted or required by law.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, then you must discontinue use of the Network.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, to people whom we do not employ or manage, or to third party websites. </p>

    <h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

    <p>We collect user information in an effort to improve your experience and to communicate with you about our services.</p>

    <p><strong>“Personal Information”</strong> is any user information that may be used to infer an individual’s identity, including, but not limited to, name, e-mail address, display name, password, geo-location data, device identifier, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data.</p>
    <p><strong>“Non-personally Identifying Information”</strong> is information that is commonly made available by web browsers and servers, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Daddyhunt uses this information to understand how visitors use our Site.</p>


    <h3>User Provided Information</h3>

    <p>We collect information that you voluntarily provide to Daddyhunt, including information entered via the Network or provide in another way, including: </p>

However, even if you choose to make non-public certain items of your profile information or other information if and as permitted by the user interface, sophisticated users who use the App in an unauthorized manner may nevertheless be able to obtain this information. YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO THE DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PROFILE INFORMATION AND INFORMATION YOU OTHERWISE VOLUNTARILY PROVIDE WHEN USING THE NETWORK AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.</p>
