<h1>
Dadaviz Privacy Policy
</h1>

<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how Dadaviz collects and uses data. If not otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms have the meaning given to them in the Dadaviz Terms of Use, which is available at <a href="/pages/terms">dadaviz.com/pages/terms</a> (the âTermsâ).
</p>

<p>
Dadaviz respects your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the uses of your information is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains Dadavizâs policies regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of any information we receive. 
</p>

<h3>
Information we Collect 
</h3>

<p>
In order to use our Site and Services, you will be required to register and provide us with certain Personal Information. We also collect Personal Information when you make use of the Site and Services. âPersonal Informationâ means information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a name or email address, or information about activities directly linked to a person, such as that personâs location. It is your voluntary decision whether to provide us with any such Personal Information, but if you refuse to provide such information we may not be able to register you to use the Site and the Services. 
</p>

<p>
If you use the Site or the Services by logging in through âFacebook Connectâ or another social network, we may also receive personal information about you which is provided by such social network. Please check the policies of such social network in order to understand what information we receive.
</p>

<p>
We collect such User Content that you provide to us. 
</p>

<p>
In addition, when you use Dadaviz certain information may be automatically gathered about your computer, browser, operating system, geo-location, IP address or mobile device, or in respect of any other of your activities using the Site or Services. 
</p>

<h3>
How we Protect Information
</h3>

<p>
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We will delete any information provided to us by a User upon the receipt of a written request by such User. We cannot restore information that we have deleted.
</p>

<h3>
How we Use Information
</h3>

<p>
Except as expressly set forth herein, we will not share your Personal Information with third parties without your explicit permission, except when required by law, regulation, subpoena or court order or in order to cooperate with an investigation by a law enforcement body. We may use Personal Information internally â for example, to help diagnose problems with our servers, to make Dadaviz more useful, or to customize Dadaviz and personalize its content for you.
</p>

<p>
We display such User Content that you upload on the Site and/or Services.
</p>

<p>
In addition, by analyzing all information we receive, including all information concerning Users, we may compile statistical information across a variety of platforms and Users (âStatistical Informationâ). Statistical Information helps understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires. Statistical Information is anonymous and we will not link Statistical Information to any Personal Information. We may share such Statistical Information with our partners, without restriction, on commercial terms that we can determine in our sole discretion. We may provide non-Personal Information that we receive to Google Analytics in order to receive an analysis of the use of our Site and Services. 
</p>

</p>

<h3>

Dadaviz uses cookies to help personalize your Dadaviz experience. A âpersistentâ cookie may be used to help save your settings and customizations across Site visits. Also, if you log in to Dadaviz, such a cookie will be used to recognize you as a valid user so you will not need to log in each time you use Dadaviz. Most Web browsers are initially configured to accept cookies, but you can change this setting so your browser either refuses all cookies or informs you when a cookie is being sent. Also, you are free to delete any existing cookies at any time. Please note that some features of Dadaviz may not function properly when cookies are disabled or removed.
