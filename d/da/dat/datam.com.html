		<h2 class="sp5t sp2b colorCta txtXL">What information we collect form our users and how we use it</h2>
		<p class="sp3b txtS">Through the registration in our Site, we may collect personal information such as name,‎ email address,‎ phone number, and any other type of personal information users submit during the course of normal correspondence with FNBox.

		<p class="sp1b txtS">We use the information we collect from our users as follows:</p>
		<ol class="sp2b txtS">
			<li class="sp1b">a) <strong>To provide our services.</strong> FNBox uses the information we collect from users to help them process their orders, track transactions, issue the invoices, offer new services, answer users comments and questions, send technical notifications or update of the services.

		</ol>
		
		<h2 class="sp5t sp2b colorCta txtXL">Collection and Use of Information</h2>
		<p class="sp3b txtS">If you no longer wish to be a part of our  users database or you no longer wish to receive communications to your email, you may contact us to team@datam.com, or in the case of emails, you may also opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication.</p>

		<h2 class="sp5t sp2b colorCta txtXL">Disclosure of users information</h2>
		<p class="sp3b txtS">FNBox will never sell, rent, lease or disclose your information to any third parties in ways other than disclosed in this privacy policy.</p>

		<p class="sp3b txtS">Whenever the lack of capacity is due to age, such lack may not be cured.

In this case, liability arising from services to which minors have access, shall be imposed on the adults responsible for them. Therefore, minors who access the Site shall obtain their parents', guardians', or legal representatives' permission, whenever such access is permitted by law.</p>

		<p class="sp3b txtS">As regards legal persons' representatives, Users shall have sufficient authority to act on behalf of the represented entity and to bind it to the terms hereof. If the User lacks such sufficient authority, or acts beyond the authorized scope, he/she shall be deemed to be bound personally.</p>
