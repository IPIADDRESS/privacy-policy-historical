<div class="intro">
	<p>For us, privacy is what it's all about. Sure we've got great technology, technically superior software and so on, but what really counts is our ability to provide our members with a safe, secure and private environment.</p>
</div>

If you configure your browser to reject cookies, you may still use some, but not all, portions of our site.

<h4>6. Personal Correspondence</h4>
<p>Correspondence sent to us including emails and letters will be stored on file with access limited to our authorised staff members.</p>
<h4>7. Disclosure of Your Information</h4>
<p></p><ul>

<li>We will only disclose your information if legally obligated to do so by a statutory authority with the appropriate jurisdiction.</li>
</ul><p></p>

<h4>12. Changes to This Policy</h4>
