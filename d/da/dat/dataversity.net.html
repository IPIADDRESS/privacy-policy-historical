<p>This is the privacy policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) that governs how Dataversity Education, LLC and our affiliated companies (“<strong>Dataversity</strong>“, “<strong>we</strong>“, “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>“), use Personal Data (defined below) that we collect, receive and store about you in connection with your use of our website:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dataversity.net/">http://www.dataversity.net/</a> and any other website or application that we operate (each, together with its sub-domains, content and services, a “<strong>Site</strong>“).</p>
<p>You may choose whether or not to provide or disclose Personal Data in connection with your use of our Site. If you choose not to provide the Personal Data we request, you may still visit and use parts of our Site, but may be unable to access or use certain features, options, programs, and services.&nbsp; Our Site may contain links to third-party websites and services that are not owned or controlled by Dataversity.

<ul>
<li><em>Contact Information</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In various areas of the Site and in printed materials, we provide you the opportunity to submit a form with basic contact information, such as your name, email, or mailing address.&nbsp; With your permission, Dataversity uses such information to inform you of new products, technical information and services, and upcoming events that may be of interest. If you no longer wish to receive these emails, the opt-out process is described in Section 7.2 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>In addition, if you choose, you may participate in a Dataversity e-mail list server by subscribing within the Site or by contacting Dataversity staff directly.&nbsp; You may unsubscribe from these e-mail list servers by following the unsubscribe instructions found within the list email.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Payment Information</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When you purchase services or products from us, third-party service providers acting on our behalf process payment information, including payment card details and billing and shipping addresses, to help us fulfill your orders.&nbsp; Any Personal Data collected by such third party will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Information Collected through Various Forms </em></li>

<p>We and our service providers may collect Personal Data in a variety of ways, including: (i) through use of the Site, e.g., when you sign up for a newsletter, download content, participate in an online conference, or through a webinar; (ii) offline, such as when you register or attend one of our conferences in person, talk with a marketing sales lead, &nbsp;participate in an in-person training program, or contact customer service; or (iii) from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, business partners, and from other third parties.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Personal Data You Disclose Relating to Others</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you disclose any Personal Data relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Site, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>3.3.&nbsp;<u>Information Collected Automatically</u>. Certain information on our Site is collected automatically by means of various software tools. We have a legitimate interest in using such information to assist in log-in, systems administration purposes, information security and abuse prevention, to track user trends, and to analyze the effectiveness of our Site. Alone or in combination with other information, such automatically collected information may constitute Personal Data. Some of our service providers (described in Section 5, below) may use cookies or other methods to gather information regarding your use of our Site. Such third parties may use these cookies or other tracking methods for their own purposes by relating information about your use of our Site with any Personal Data about you that they may have. The use of such information by a third party depends on the privacy policy of that third party.</p>
<ol>
<li>a) <u>Log Files On Our Site</u>. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (“<strong>IP</strong>”) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, clicked pages and any other information your browser may send to us.</li>
<li>b)&nbsp;<u>Cookies</u>.&nbsp; We use cookies to make interactions with our Site easy and meaningful. When you visit our Site, our servers may send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to us, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a web form, you remain anonymous to us.</li>
</ol>
<p>We may use cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. Please note that if you disable your web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate our Site, but you may not be able to successfully use all of the features of our Site. For more information on how to manage your cookie settings, please visit our help page <a href="http://www.dataversity.net/about-dataversity-net/privacy-policy/cookies-settings/">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you have chosen to identify yourself to us, we use cookies containing encrypted information to allow us to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into our Site, a cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed on your browser. These cookies allow us to uniquely identify you when you are logged into our Site and to process your online transactions and requests.</p></td>

<td><strong>Targeting or Advertising cookies</strong></td>
<td>From time-to-time, we may engage third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from individuals who visit our Site. We sometimes use cookies delivered by third parties to track the performance of our advertisements. For example, these cookies remember which browsers have visited our Site. The information provided to third parties does not include Personal Data, but this information may be re-associated with Personal Data after we receive it.<p></p>
<p>By way of example, as you browse our Site, advertising cookies may be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in. Our advertising partners then enable us to present you with retargeted advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with our Site.</p>
<p>We also contract with third-party advertising networks and similar partners that collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons (see below) on our Site, from emails, and on third-party sites. Ad networks follow your online activities over time by collecting Site Navigational Information through automated means, including through the use of cookies. They use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests. You may see these advertisements on other websites. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Third parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.</p></td>

<li><strong>Personal Data Transferred from the EU or Switzerland To The United States.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Dataversity complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework&nbsp; (collectively, “<strong>Privacy Shield</strong>”) as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union (the “<strong>EU</strong>”) member countries and Switzerland. Dataversity has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Purpose Limitation, Access, Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability. A violation of our commitment to Privacy Shield may be investigated by the Federal Trade Commission and/or the United States Department of Commerce. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, to the extent available, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov">https://www.privacyshield.gov</a>.</p>
<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Dataversity commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of Personal Data about you. Persons from the EU or Switzerland who have inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy should first contact us via email at: <a href="mailto:info@dataversity.net">info@dataversity.net</a>.</p>
<p>Dataversity has committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield">https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield</a> for more information and to file a complaint.</p>
<p>These recourse mechanisms are available at no cost to you. Damages may be awarded in accordance with applicable law. Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the Privacy Shield, Dataversity is potentially liable.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>Data</strong> <strong>Security.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The security of Personal Data is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong>Children’s Privacy.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Our Site is not intended for children under the age of 18. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Data from anyone we know to be under 18 years of age.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li><strong>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Dataversity does not track Site users over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising. Accordingly, we do not currently respond or take any action with respect to web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of Personal Data about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.</p>
<ol start="12">
