How we Protect your Personal Information</h2><p>The security of your personal information is very important to us. In our efforts to protect your online transactions, we use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your personal information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet.</p><p>We have also obtained a digital certificate from DigiCert®, a leading provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secure portion of our site (which is any page containing any of your personal information), an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small pop-up window displaying site-security information will appear. This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form to an EmpireStores.Co web server, not to some unknown or unauthorized server.</p><p>Ultimately, your personal information is protected by the password that you entered when you created an account (or another password you chose after changing a previous password). Please keep this password confidential. The confidentiality of your password is your responsibility to protect. You may change it anytime by going to <a href="/Account/AccountHomePage">Your Account</a>, then click "Change Password" and enter a new password.</p><hr><h2><a name="7"></a>7. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2><p>We reserve the right to change, modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time, without prior notice, and we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Privacy Policy and your continued use of The Website constitutes your agreement as to all such updated or modified Privacy Policies. By using or visiting The Website, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this policy, then do not use or visit The Website.</p><hr><h2><a name="8"></a>8. How to Contact Us</h2><p>If you have comments or questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact <a href="/Account/Inquiry">Customer Service</a>. We will address any issue to the best of our abilities.</p><p>Thank you for your support of our policies.</p></div>
