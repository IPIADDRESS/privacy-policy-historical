    gender and age, and other demographic information such as your hometown or your username.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Information from other sources.</strong>

<p>
    <strong>Third-party websites</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For
    example, if you click on an advertisement on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may
    independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your
    activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link
    typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How you can access your information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account and clicking
    on Settings. More information about how to contact us is provided below. If you have an online account with us, you also may delete or disable your account
    at any time by visiting the "Settings" page for your account. If you delete or disable your account, we may still retain certain information associated
    with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and
    conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our website or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In
    addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be
    subject to those third parties' policies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Your choices about collection and use of your information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such
    information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or
    sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our website.
</p>
<p>
    You may be given the opportunity, in any commercial email that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. We request a reasonable
    time to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship email communications, such as service announcements,
    administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your
    account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications, will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have
    already provided your information to a third party (such as a service provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you
    may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.
</p>
<p>
    You can also control information collected by cookies. See <strong>Cookies</strong> below for information about declining or deleting cookies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How we protect your personal information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from
    unauthorized access and disclosure. We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure.
    Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or
    other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid
sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the <a></a><a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm">Federal Trade Commission's website</a> for
    information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Information you provide about yourself while using our service</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others or upload content such as
photographs. Such postings are governed by our <a></a><a href="http://www.okcupid.com/terms">Terms</a> of Use. In addition,
    such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal
    information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post
    your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you
    voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Children's privacy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Although our website is a general audience site, we restrict the use of our service to individuals age 18 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal
    information from children under the age of 13.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Visiting our websites from outside the United States</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our website from residents of the United States. If you are visiting our website from
    outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are
    located and our central database is operated. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those
    third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>No Rights of Third Parties</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this
    Privacy Policy. We recommend that you check our website from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other
    policies.

    <strong>Cookies:</strong>
    A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies.
    A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie remains on your
    hard drive for an extended period of time. Cookies on our website do not link to or store your personal information.
</p>
<p>
    For example, when you sign in to our website, we will record your user or member ID and the name associated with your user or member ID in the cookie file
    on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For
    security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies. In the case of
    sites and services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may allow our authorized service providers to serve
    cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content
    and advertising.
</p>
<p>
    You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. Click "Help" in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions. If you do so, some of
    the features and services of our website may not function properly.
</p>
<p>
    We may allow third-parties, including IAC companies, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use
    tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not provide any
    personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on
    the advertisements they deliver (such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, etc.),
    and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this information with personal
    information they collect from you to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. The collection and use of
    that information is subject to the third-party's privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their
    effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which
offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies and provides information about this behavioral advertising practice (    <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">www.networkadvertising.org</a>). This policy covers the use of cookies by DateHookup.com only and does not
    cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Web Beacons:</strong>
    Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to
    track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded
    invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
</p>
<p>
    Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may
    receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website. Third parties may use
    anonymous information about your visits to our site and other websites in order to improve its products and services and provide advertisements about goods
    and services of interest to you.
