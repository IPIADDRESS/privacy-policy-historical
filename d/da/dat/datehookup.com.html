												We recognize that privacy is important.  Below are some common questions and answers related to how we handle privacy.
												<br><br>
												<b>What kind of information is collected on this site?</b>
												<br><br>
												When you join DateHookup.com, you will have to submit certain personal information, such as an email address, your gender, age, and other 
												information that a typical dating site would need.  Your email address is always private and never shared with anyone. Other information that you 
												submit will be available on your profile, as one would expect ;-)
												<br><br>
												<b>Do you share my info with other companies?</b>
												<br><br>
												We don't give, sell, or share any information you submit to us to third parties, unless requested by police or required by law.
												<br><br>
												<b>Member Screening</b>
												<br><br>
												DateHookup.com does NOT screen its member profiles for accuracy in any way (that would be basically impossible) nor does it conduct any kind of background checks on members. Members 
												use this site at their own risk.  Use the same common sense you would use meeting people in the offline world.  Background checks are not always accurate 
												(someone could just submit fake personal information after all, plus not all criminal records are available online), 
												so they should never be counted on to replace common sense and skepticism.  ALWAYS meet someone new in a very public place, and let someone close to you know you are 
												meeting someone.
												<br><br>
												<b>Why do you need my email address?</b>
												<br><br>
												We require your email address so we can alert you of new messages, winks, friend requests, new singles in your area, etc. We do not 
												abuse this feature, as our goal is to never annoy our users.  There is an unsubscribe link on every email we send so you can stop 
												receiving emails anytime with the click of a button.
												<br><br>
												<b>Regarding advertisements on this site</b>
												<br><br>
												We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, 
												address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements 
												about goods and services of interest to you.  Information sent is always aggregated. For example, we might offer advertisers the ability 
												to advertise to age groups such as 18-30. If you fell into this age range, you would be in this group and might receive ads targeted to your 
												age group.  None of your personal information is used directly, it's grouped with thousands of other members. Google is our ad vendor. For more information 
												about how Google serves ads, please <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">click here</a>.
												<br><br>
												<b>Can I hide or remove my profile from DateHookup.com?</b>
												<br><br>
												You can set your profile to 'invisible' any time you want.  This will make it so no one can see your profile. You can 
												set it back to visible at any time. You can also cancel your account at any time.  This will completely delete your profile 
												from our system.  We don't try to make it impossible to delete yourself like some other sites might, deleting your account takes 
												just 3 clicks from anywhere on the site.  But you won't want to leave, this place is too much fun!
												<br><br>
												<b>Do you use cookies?</b>
												<br><br>
												We use cookies to enable the functions on this site to work. Without them DH would not function, so in order 
												to use this site please have cookies enabled.  Cookies are just small text files that reside on your computer. 
												Sites will store session information in cookies in order to know whether you are logged in, etc.  They are private.
												<br><br>
												<b>Links</b>
												<br><br>
												When browsing this site, you may encounter links that point to other sites. This could be in the form of advertising, or links that users 
												might put in their profiles.  DateHookup.com is not affiliated with these sites.
												<br><br>
												<b>Communication with other members</b>
												<br><br>
												Communication with other members on this site is handled through our messaging and instant messaging systems. Your email 
												address is never used for communication and remains private at all times.  The only personal information that is available to other members 
												is what you have in your profile or what you give them.
