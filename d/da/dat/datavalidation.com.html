              </ul>
              <h2 class="color2">Privacy Policy:</h2>
              <h3>Effective: Feb 21, 2013</h3>
              <p>DataValidation is a web application that uses public information found on the Internet. Providing the DataValidation services requires collecting and sharing information about you, while shielding sensitive personal information from risks
                of misuse.</p>
              <p>DataValidation (“DataValidation”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive when you visit and use the www.DataValidation.com
                site and any websites owned or operated by DataValidation (collectively, the “Sites”), and when you use any of DataValidation’s data append services (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you
                provide to us when you access, download, purchase or use any information, services, products or content appearing on the Sites or offered by DataValidation through the Services. The use of information provided by commercial users of our
                Service (“Clients”) in connection with our Services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has engaged DataValidation, subject to this Privacy Policy and the written Service agreement between DataValidation
                and Client.</p>
              <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you or our Client by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by
                means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
              <p>Information Collection: Personally &amp; Publicly Identifiable Information</p>
              <p>In the course of using the Services, we ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account (“Personally Identifiable Information”). Personally Identifiable
                Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and postal addresses.</p>
              <p>DataValidation collects contact information that is publically accessible (e.g. information that is available to search engines)(“Publicly Identifiable Information”). Publicly Identifiable Information (e.g. a social network profile that
                is not set to ‘private’ or information on a social network page that can be seen to users who are not logged in), is searched and sometimes indexed by DataValidation, just like major Internet search engines. DataValidation recommends that
                if you do not want to be searched or indexed by search engines or services like DataValidation, that you set the appropriate privacy controls within social networks and 3rd party applications like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. You can
                learn how to do this by visiting these sites directly.</p>
              <h3>DataValidation Marketing Optimization Application</h3>
              <p>The DataValidation Marketing Optimization Application allows Clients to dynamically populate their contacts with Marketing Optimization Scores. To enable this application, we will download the contact information for each user’s contacts
                and leads, and use this information to determine various optimization scores for each contact. We will give users the ability to review these matches and choose the most likely correct match. DataValidation will then store match information
                for use within the Service.</p>
              <p>Clients access the DataValidation Service via API or SFTP. More information is available at developer.DataValidation.com. As you use the Services, our servers automatically record information that the browser sends whenever it points to
                a website or online service (“Log Data”). Log Data may include, but is not limited to, your computer’s Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to one of the Sites and information you search
                for on Sites.</p>
              <p>DataValidation collects information under the direction of its Clients when providing our Services, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes.</p>
              <p>Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use “persistent cookies” to save your username and login password for
                future logins to the Sites. We use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor web traffic routing on the Sites and aggregate usage of the Services.
                You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of
                the Sites or all functionality of the Services. Our cookies are tied to personally identifiable information.</p>
              <h3>Our Policy Toward Children</h3>
              <p>DataValidation does not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personally Identifiable Information without their consent,
                he or she should contact us at privacy [at] DataValidation . If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.</p>
              <h3>How We Use Personal Information</h3>

                you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to DataValidation, please be advised that we transfer Personally Identifiable Information to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy
                Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
