                <p>We believe that a rational and sensible policy for the  privacy of information should shield our users to the greatest extent  reasonably possible against indiscriminate disclosure of private information,  to the extent compatible with the functionality of our service and its  commercial purposes, from those who do not have a practical need or reasonable  commercial purpose in possessing the information. This Policy explains how we  aim to protect the user's privacy and how we determine and implement the  appropriate and reasonable balance of privacy and disclosure consistent with  the practical necessities of functionality and economic viability. </p>
                <p><strong>The  Nature of the Information We Collect</strong> </p>
                <p>In order for our Services to work and  to work economically, we need to obtain from our users some personally  identifiable information which includes the user's name and email address. </p>
