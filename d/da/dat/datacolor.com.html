<p>Collection of Personally Information (“Personal Information”). Datacolor AG and all its affiliates and subsidaries<br>
(“DATACOLOR”) operates this website (the “Site”). All references to “we”, “us”, “our”, this “website” or this “Site” shall be construed to mean DATACOLOR. We understand that visitors to this Site are concerned about the privacy of information. The following describes our privacy policy regarding information that we collect through this Site.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, and without prior notice, by posting an amended Privacy Policy that is always accessible by clicking on the “Privacy Policy” link on this Site’s home page. Your continued use of this Site indicates your acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy. You should check the Privacy Policy through this link periodically for modifications by clicking on the link provided near the top of the Privacy Policy for a listing of material modifications and their effective dates. Regarding Personal Information, if any modifications are materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of the Personal Information previously disclosed by you, we will obtain your consent before implementing such revisions with respect to such information.</p>
<p>DATACOLOR is a global corporation with subsidiary companies located around the world. This Privacy Statement establishes our global principles for the collection, use and disclosure of information gathered through our Sites. The country in which you are doing business with us or where the Site you are visiting is located/hosted may have specific requirements concerning personal information which you agreed to abide by.</p>

<p>1.	Collection of Anonymous, Passive Information<br>
We reserve the right to monitor your use of this Site. As you navigate through this Site, certain anonymous information may be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream). For example, as explained in more detail below, your Internet browser automatically transmits to this Site some of this anonymous information, such as the URL of the website you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer is currently using. This Site may also collect anonymous information from your computer through cookies and Internet tags or web beacons. You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of this Site might not work without cookies. The following is a listing and a brief explanation of passive information collection methodologies which we may use from time to time to better understand how this Site is being used.</p>
<p>•	A “cookie” is a bit of information that this Site sends to your Web browser which helps us remember information about you and your preferences.</p>
<p>•	“Session” cookies are temporary bits of information that are used to improve navigation, block visitors from providing information where inappropriate (the Site “remembers” previous entries of age or country of origin that were outside the specified parameters and blocks subsequent changes), and collect aggregate statistical information on the Site. They are erased once you exit your Web browser or otherwise turn off your computer.</p>
<p>•	“Persistent” cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided, helping to determine what areas of the Site you may find most valuable, and customizing the Site based on your preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent cookies placed by this Site in your computer do not hold Personal Information.</p>
<p>•	You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can decide each time whether to accept it. To learn more about cookies and how to specify your preferences, please search for “cookie” in the “Help” portion of your browser.</p>
<p>•	An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user’s computer). The IP address can be used to diagnose problems with a server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to a Site, and administer and improve the Site.</p>
<p>•	“Internet tags” (also known as Web Beacons, single-Personal Information xel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the Web Site server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor’s computer. Tags may be placed both on online advertisements that bring people to the Site and on different pages of the Site. Such tags indicate how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted.</p>
<p>•	“Navigational data” (log files, server logs, and clickstream data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the Site, market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors.</p>
<p>2.	Use and Disclosure of Anonymous, Passive Information<br>
This Site may make full use of passively collected anonymous information through the collection methods described above for our own internal operational purposes, including without limitation the right to use such information to provide better service to Site visitors, customize the Site based on your preferences, compile and analyze statistics and trends, and otherwise administer and improve this Site for your use. We reserve the right to share this information in the same manner as provided below for Personal Information.</p>
<p>3.	Use of 3rd Party Cookies – Analytics<br>
This Site reserves the right to use web analytics services provided by third parties, such as the Google™ Analytics service by Google, Inc. These services use cookies (sometimes referred to as 3rd party cookies) which are text files placed on your computer, to help us analyze how users use this Site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this Site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by the service provider. We will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of this Site, comparing reports on website activity for website operators, and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. These services may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on the service’s behalf. These services will not associate your IP address with any other data held by an analytics service provider. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser; however, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this Site. By using this Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by third party analytics services in the manner and for the purposes set out above.</p>
<p>4. Collection of Personal Identifiable Information<br>
Personally identifiable information is information you provide that lets us know specific facts about you so that we can respond to your requests. Depending on the portion of the website you visit and the information you provide, this information could range from your name, address and ZIP code, which you provide in order to receive information from us about certain services, to specific information that you provide to us on an admission form.</p>
<p>•	Credit Card Information<br>
If you choose to purchase products or services from Datacolor, you may be required to provide personal information and authorization to obtain information from various credit services. ALTHOUGH WE MAY COLLECT CREDIT CARD INFORMATION FOR PURPOSES OF TRANSACTION PROCESSING, WE DO NOT STORE OR ARCHIVE CREDIT CARD INFORMATION ON THIS SITE.</p>
<p>•	E-mail Correspondence<br>
If you choose to correspond with us through e-mail, we may retain the content of your E-mail and our response so that we can more efficiently handle any follow-up questions you may have. From time to time, DATACOLOR may use your personal information to contact you by electronic mail concerning your use of our services.
