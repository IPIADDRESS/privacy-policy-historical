<h2>DataViz Privacy Statement</h2>

<p class="10class">At DataViz, we take your privacy very seriously.  We are NOT in the business of selling, renting or disclosing your personally identifiable information to others.  We have created this statement to describe our commitment to your privacy.  
 
</p><p class="10class"><b>What information do we gather and track?</b><br>
			
We record IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) to track sessions on our site. Tracking gives us an idea of which parts and pages of our site users are visiting, how often they visit them, and how long they spend there. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that even if your session is tracked, you still remain anonymous.

</p><p class="10class">We also track browser type and platform. We use this information to deliver customized information specific to a particular platform and to determine the "mix" of browser types   accessing our site.  This information helps us make our site operate correctly with your browser. 
		</p><p class="10class">However, if you:

		</p><ul>
			<li class="10class">Purchase a product from DataViz
			</li><li class="10class">Register a new product
			</li><li class="10class">Download a demo of our software
			</li><li class="10class">Sign up for a mailing list or enter a contest
			</li><li class="10class">Fill out a survey, or sign onto a page that requires authorization
			</li><li class="10class">Or enter into any other transaction with us,
		</li></ul>
		<p class="10class">you may be asked to provide us your name, e-mail address, phone number, fax number, postal address, credit card number (for purchases), and possibly other personal information.  Additional demographic information may be optionally requested in order to improve our service to our customers.  We may use the information you provide to:

		</p><ul>
			<li class="10class">Keep you informed of new releases of our products

			</li><li class="10class">Provide helpful hints and tips on how to use our products
			</li><li class="10class">Make special offers that we extend only to our registered customers.
			</li><li class="10class">Improve our site and the services we offer you.
		</li></ul>
		<p class="10class"><b>Cookies and how we use them</b><br>
			Cookies are unique text files that are sent to your browser from a Web server. As you browse our web site, cookies are placed on your computer's hard drive to track the method of your referral to our site and whether you downloaded demo software and/or purchased software. The usage of these cookies is generally not linked to any personally identifiable information; however, if you demo or purchase a product from our web site, we may keep a record of how you reached our site to help us understand your interests and thereby serve you better.

		</p><p class="10class"><b>How do we use the information we gather and track?</b><br>
			
The information collected may be used for processing orders, personalizing the shopping experience, contests, promotions, newsletters, announcements, special offers, etc.   

</p><p class="10class">When you download a demo version of one of our products, we reserve the right to send a reasonable number of e-mail follow-up messages with information regarding purchasing the software.  

</p><p class="10class">From time to time, we partner with companies whose products we believe will interest you.  We don't normally give your information to our partners, but rather we inform you directly ourselves of these offers via e-mail or postal mail.  Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.  Please see the  "Choose or Opt-Out" section below.

</p><p class="10class"><b>With whom may we share your information?</b><br>
			 
We may collect, create and disclose to third parties aggregated, anonymous statistics regarding our sales, traffic analyses and other information regarding or collected through our web site.  This information won't include individually identifiable data about you. 

</p><p class="10class">We may also sometimes engage agents or contractors to perform services necessary to our operations (for example, delivery of products, distribution of e-mail, etc.).  When we do, we may give them access to name, addresses or other information necessary for them to do their job for us, but not for any other purpose.  

</p><p class="10class">Finally, in the event our company or its assets were ever sold, our customer database naturally would be transferred to the new owner.   

</p><p class="10class">Except as described above, and except as may be required by law, we will not disclose your personally identifiable information to others without your consent. 

</p><p class="10class"><b>Choose or Opt-Out</b><br>
			<u>Announce Lists:</u> You can subscribe or unsubscribe from any of our product announce lists <a href="../eforms/lists/DVZlisthome.html">here</a>. These announce lists will be used to send subscribers any announcements (product upgrades, special offers, etc.) relevant to the list to which they are subscribed.
			
			
</p><p class="10class"><u>Registered DataViz Customers:</u> Registered customers who do not wish to receive product announcements or special offers can contact DataViz to update their account accordingly.
</p><p class="10class"><b>Correction/Updating Personal Information</b><br>
			If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if you no longer desire our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove your personal data provided to us. This can be accomplished by contacting DataViz via e-mail, fax, phone or mail communication. Registered users can submit a request to change their information <a href="../eforms/registration/changeregiform.html">here</a> or by <a href="../contact/index.html">contacting DataViz</a> directly.
			



</p><p class="10class"><b>Links to Other Web Sites</b><br>
			
The DataViz site contains links to other Web sites.  Although we do not provide any personally identifiable information to these companies, we cannot guarantee your privacy once you leave the DataViz site.  We are not responsible for the privacy policies, practices or content of web sites with links on our site.  We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement whenever interacting with any web site.

</p><p class="10class"><b>Safe Shopping</b><br>
			Protecting your order information is important to us and we make every effort to protect your online order information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. However, some firewalls and certain versions of browsers don't permit communication through secure servers.
