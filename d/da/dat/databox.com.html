        <p class="thick">
            We are committed to protecting our visitors' and members' privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by Databox, how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
            <br>
            <br>
            This document is for your information only. The "Company", "Databox", "us", "we" or "our" refers to Zepppelin Inc., the owner of Databox, a company incorporated in the State of California, USA.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>BY USING OUR WEBSITE / WEB APLICATION, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</b>
            <br>
            Please review the following carefully so that you understand our privacy practices.
        </p>

        <h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, when you register. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses.
            <br><br>
            In addition, tracking information is collected as you navigate through our site. To help us serve your needs better, we use "cookies" to store and sometimes track user information. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a preference within your browser. We use Mixpanel, an independent measurement and research company, in our app, and KISSmetrics on our website, which use cookies and code to gather non-personal data regarding the number and frequency of visitors to our site. Further information regarding Mixpanel can be found at <a href="http://www.mixpanel.com" rel="external">www.mixpanel.com</a> and regarding KISSmetrics at <a href="http://www.kissmetrics.com" rel="external">www.kissmetrics.com</a>.
            <br><br>
            Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you register with or view our site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website.
        </p>

        <h2>The Way We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of Databox. Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose by posting to the Databox becomes available to the other users in your Network. If you remove user content, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your user content.
            <br><br>
            By providing Databox your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Databox related notices, including any notices required by law. You may use settings to opt-out or change the frequency of Databox related communications.
            <br><br>
            We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of Databox, or special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt-out.
            <br><br>
            We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; provide custom, personalized content and information; monitor the effectiveness of our service; monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP; and help you efficiently access your information after you sign in.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Commitment To Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            The personally identifiable information we collect is securely stored within our database, and we use standard, industry-wide, commercially reasonable security practices such as encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers 256 bit) for protecting your information.
            <br><br>
            <b>We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Databox and you do so at your own risk.</b> Once we receive your transmission of information, Databox makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Since our content and services are not directed towards kids, children under 13 are not allowed to register with our website or to participate in public posting areas on our website. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Databox. If we discover that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, Databox will delete that information as soon as possible.
        </p>

        <h2>User Content and Message Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
            Your user content is kept private in your Network. Databox does not monitor the user content you post on the site. We do not have administrative tools to view our users' messages, and access to the database is only granted to our technicians on a case-by-case basis to troubleshoot specific technical issues, or as may be required by law.
        </p>

        <h2>Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
        <p>
            Databox will not share, rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others. Databox may store personal information on its own servers or databases hosted in a secured environment behind an advanced firewall.
            <br><br>
            As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.
            <br><br>
            Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, Databox will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Databox, our users or others.
            <br><br>
            We may, however, perform statistical analysis of customer usage in order to measure interest in, and use of, the various parts of the Website, and may share that information in the course of our business, but such shared information shall be in aggregated form only (statistics, etc.), and will contain no personally identifiable information whatsoever.
        </p>

        <h2>Compromise of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Databox will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the Notification Procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.
            <br><br>
            You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal information in public areas, on public bulletin boards, or in public classified advertisement areas within the Website, that information might be collected and disseminated by third-parties, and result in, among other things, unsolicited inquiries, messages, and offers from third-parties.

Please also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal information in the Messages, Groups or your Profile page within the Website, all users who are authorized to access such areas will have access to such personal information, and that information might be collected and disseminated by those users, and result in, among other things, unsolicited inquiries, messages, and offers from such users. Databox urges you to exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information on the Website, in either public or private areas of the Website.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Information</h2>
