<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<div id="intro">
<p>
The rapid growth of the internet has brought with it a whole new set
of issues regarding personal privacy. Data Foundry fully respects your
privacy rights, and our policies have reflected our commitment to your
privacy since we started offering news service to the public.
</p><p>
Data Foundry holds personal information about you in the strictest
confidence and does not sell or rent that information. Data Foundry
will not release or divulge any customer information unless ordered to
do so by a court of law.
</p><p>
What follows is the Data Foundry Privacy Policy, which has remained
unchanged since the company's inception.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Customer Information</h2>
<div class="desc">
<p>
Data Foundry requires certain information at the time of signup and in
the course of providing customer support. This information is
necessary for us to provide quality service and support. This
information is never released to others, unless we are ordered by a
court of competent jurisdiction to do so. Data Foundry has never sold
or rented customer lists or any other customer information, and Data
Foundry will never do so.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Usage Information</h2>
<div class="desc">
<p>
Data Foundry monitors its servers to the extent necessary to ensure
that high standards of maintenance are met. Data Foundry does not
monitor or record your activities.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Civil Investigations</h2>
<div class="desc">
<p>
Data Foundry will not release a customer's personal information or
usage information to investigators, attorneys, or agencies unless we
are directed to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction in the
matter. If there is a hearing in court, the customer will be notified
so they will have an opportunity to contest the surrender of personal
information.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Criminal Investigations</h2>
<div class="desc">
<p>
Data Foundry cooperates fully with law enforcement agencies, yet there
must still be a court order before Data Foundry surrenders customer
information. The Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution requires a
court order to conduct a search and seizure. Data Foundry will, when
requested by law enforcement entities, acknowledge the existence of
personal customer information, and when requested, provide the
technical language to include in the court order, "particularly
describing ... the property to be seized." In a criminal investigation
Data Foundry is under a duty not to divulge the fact of the
investigation to the customer.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Safe Harbor Privacy Policy</h2>
<div class="desc">
<p>
Data Foundry, Inc. and its Affiliates (hereinafter referred to as the 
“Companies”) have elected to comply with the Safe Harbor Privacy
Framework developed by The United States Department of Commerce and
the European Commission.  This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy applies to
all personal information received by the Companies in the United
States from the European Economic Area.
</p><p>
The Companies agree to comply with the seven safe harbor principles. The principles require the following:
</p>
<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>
Companies must notify individuals about the purposes for which they
collect and use information about them. They must provide information
about how individuals can contact the organization with any inquiries
or complaints, the types of third parties to which it discloses the
information and the choices and means the organization offers for
limiting its use and disclosure.
</p>
<h3>Choice</h3>
<p>
Companies must give individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out)
whether their personal information will be disclosed to a third party
or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was
originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For
sensitive information, affirmative or explicit (opt in) choice must be
given if the information is to be disclosed to a third party or used
for a purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose
authorized subsequently by the individual.  Data Foundry’s Privacy
Policy exceeds this standard; we never disclose personal information
to third parties unless ordered to do so by a court of competent
jurisdiction in the matter.
</p>

<h3>Onward Transfer (Transfers to Third Parties)</h3>
<p>
To disclose information to a third party, Companies must apply the
notice and choice principles. Where an organization wishes to transfer
information to a third party that is acting as an agent(1), it may do
so if it makes sure that the third party subscribes to the safe harbor
principles or is subject to the Directive or another adequacy
finding. As an alternative, the organization can enter into a written
agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide
at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the
relevant principles.
</p>
<h3>Access</h3>
<p>
Individuals must have access to personal information about them that
an organization holds and be able to correct, amend, or delete that
information where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or expense
of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the
individual's privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of
persons other than the individual would be violated.
</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
Companies must take reasonable precautions to protect personal
information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure,
alteration and destruction.
</p>
<h3>Data integrity</h3>
<p>
Personal information must be relevant for the purposes for which it is
to be used. An organization should take reasonable steps to ensure
that data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and
current.
</p>
<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>
In order to ensure compliance with the safe harbor principles, there
must be (a) readily available and affordable independent recourse
mechanisms so that each individual's complaints and disputes can be
investigated and resolved and damages awarded where the applicable law
or private sector initiatives so provide; (b) procedures for verifying
that the commitments companies make to adhere to the safe harbor
principles have been implemented; and (c) obligations to remedy
problems arising out of a failure to comply with the
principles. Sanctions must be sufficiently rigorous to ensure
compliance by the organization. Companies that fail to provide annual
self certification letters will no longer appear in the list of
participants and safe harbor benefits will no longer be assured.
</p>
