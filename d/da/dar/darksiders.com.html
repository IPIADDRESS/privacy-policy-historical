            <h2><strong>THQ Nordic GmbH Privacy Policy</strong></h2>

<p>Thank you for visiting http://www.thqnordic.com (the "Site"), the official website of THQ Nordic GmbH referred to in this Privacy Policy as "THQ NORDIC", "we" and "us". This Privacy Policy explains how we use information we collect about you and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.</p>

<h3>Children and This Site</h3>

<p>It is important to us that children can enjoy this Site in a responsible fashion. We, therefore, encourage children to consult with their parents before providing personal information and require that applicants who are under 18 years of age get parental consent before using this Site. As such we may refuse to allow registration on this Site by children under 18 years of age. If a child below the age of 18 would like to access content only available through registration, their parent should register on this Site themselves and access the content for their child, thereby supervising their child's online activities whilst on this Site.</p>

<p>We further encourage parents to supervise their children's online activities by, for example, adopting parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools can also help prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission.</p>

<h3>The Information We Collect and How We Use It</h3>

<p>THQ NORDIC takes your privacy seriously, and takes every reasonable precaution to safeguard the personal information you supply to us. In order to give you the best experience on this Site, THQ NORDIC may collect personal information from you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Typically, we may ask a user to submit personal and/or demographic information, and it will usually take the form of either: (1) registration; (2) requests for technical support/customer service; and/or (3) personal information submitted in a business capacity (e.g. CVs). The types of information that may be requested for each activity and the way information may be used are detailed below. Any information you provide is safeguarded under the terms of the Act.</p>

<p>In addition to the uses specified above, we may on occasion use your personal and demographic information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services that we provide. We may also ask you for other information, including, but not limited to, your interests, in order to assist us in our initiatives outlined above and to improve our understanding of customer trends and patterns. However, if we make such a request, we will clearly mark whether or not we need such information for providing products or services to you.</p>

<p>Your data, together with that of other users of this Site, may be aggregated (e.g. by postcode or age) for the purpose of building statistical and analytical reports. At no time will your data be individually identifiable in such reports.</p>

<p>No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfil your online requests and our legitimate business objectives.</p>

<h3>Newsletter</h3>

<p>When subscribing to our newsletter a visitor needs to provide the following mandatory information: Email Address, Gender, Language (German or English). Further information which will support us in providing better products and services is mandatory, e.g. Region, preferred Genres, preferred Platforms etc.).</p>

<h3>Other Types Of Information Gathering</h3>

<p>Occasionally our website gathers visitors’ data via temporary marketing activities such as promotional offers, surveys, etc. Participation in these activities happens on a voluntary basis, which allows the visitor to decide whether to disclose any personal data. Such data may include contact information (e.g. name, email, phone number), demographic information (e.g. zip code, date of birth) or others. The data will be used to provide the visitor with the service requested. Data gathered via surveys will be used for improving our website and services.</p>

<h3>Changing/Editing Personal Information</h3>

<p>Every email sent by THQ Nordic allows the user to change, edit, add or remove any information she/he provided us while registering for an THQ Nordic service or contact request on the website.</p>

<h3>Unsubscribe</h3>

<p>Users who wish to no longer receive our newsletter or promotional emails may click on a link named “Unsubscribe” which is embedded with every email sent by THQ Nordic in order to not receive future messages.</p>

<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>In order to register for this Site and to subsequently participate in this Site's on-line activities and competitions, information will be required to be submitted to THQ NORDIC. The types of information that may be collected at these pages include, but are not limited to: your name, age, sex, e-mail address, postal address, and telephone number. We request these details in order to register you as a user of this Site, to provide services to you, to respond to any queries you may have and to understand customer trends and patterns.</p>

<h3>Technical Support/Customer Service</h3>

<p>THQ NORDIC may collect and temporarily store personal information that you voluntarily submit to us via e-mail when contacting Customer Service. For example, we provide on this Site a link through which an online visitor can send e-mail to customer service addressing any issue a user encounters with a THQ NORDIC product. Any personal information contained in such email is used by THQ NORDIC for the sole purpose of responding to your question. Although most e-mail messages are deleted immediately after they are responded to, in certain cases hard copies or data from certain e-mail correspondence may be kept on file for security purposes. Any such copy or data will also be stored in a secure location, and information from these messages will not be used for marketing purposes.</p>

<h3>What Happens If I Choose Not To Give My Personal Information?</h3>

<p>If you choose not to submit personal information when requested, you may not be able to participate in certain activities on this Site and may considerably limit the services we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to provide your email address when registering, you will not be able to enter competitions and receive our newsletter. To simply use this Site, however, you do not need to give us any personal information.<br>
However, we may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to third parties including advertisers, business partners and sponsors. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file as described below.</p>

<h2>Cookies, IP Addresses and Other Passive Information</h2>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>When you visit this Site we may send "cookies" to your computer primarily to enhance your on-line experience. "Cookies" are small files or record-keeping devices that websites often store on a user's computer in order to identify them as a unique customer and store personal preferences as well as technical information. For example, cookies allow us to remember your screen name, tell us that you have visited our website before, and may contain information that will make your next visit to this Site more enjoyable. In addition, cookies may include information about the type of browser software you use to access the Internet (e.g., Internet Explorer or Netscape 3.0), the type of operating system you use (e.g., Windows Vista, Mac, etc.), and/or the domain name of your Internet service provider. However, THQ NORDIC will not use cookies to store any personal information, such as your name, or retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie.</p>

<p>Although most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, you can set most browsers at any time to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, please note that some parts of this Site may not function properly if you refuse cookies.</p>

<p><em>IP Addresses</em><br>
THQ NORDIC keeps track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Your IP address is typically used to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.</p>

<p><em>Other Information</em><br>
Other information collected passively by THQ NORDIC is in the form of logs " files that record website activity, including how many "hits" a particular web page is getting (sometimes referred to as "click-through data"). For example, log file entries are generated every time a visitor clicks an image on this Site. These entries are generated anonymously, and enable THQ NORDIC to assess overall site activity, track interest in particular portions of this Site, troubleshoot technical concerns, and identify the type of browser you are using. We may also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user or with any personal information.</p>

<h3>Who Collects My Personal Information?</h3>

<p>The information that you disclose while visiting our website is collected by THQ Nordic GmbH, and is used in the manner specified above.</p>

<p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of this Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You must not share a password with anyone.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to this Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access to that information.</p>

<p><strong>Information Sharing</strong><br>
We may share information about visitors to this Site in aggregate with third parties including advertisers, business partners and sponsors, to understand customer trends and patterns and manage and improve our business relationships. Please be assured that such information will be anonymous and will contain no personally identifiable information about you, or any other user of this Site. We may also share your details with third parties (such as auditors or legal advisors) to obtain professional advice.</p>

<p>Any agents and contractors of THQ NORDIC who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing.</p>

<p>We will not disclose your personal information to any outside organisation who wants to market goods or services to you without first obtaining your consent. If you provide such consent but subsequently decide that you no longer wish us to make such disclosures to other organisations for this purpose, then you can simply e-mail us at webmaster@thqnordic.com and we will edit your information for you accordingly.</p>

<p>We may disclose information we hold in response to legal proceedings, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request. Consequently, although we will take all reasonable efforts to ensure that this Privacy Policy is complied with, we cannot guarantee that personal information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>In the event that THQ NORDIC or any subsidiary or business unit of THQ NORDIC is sold, the customer information that belongs to THQ NORDIC, that subsidiary or that business unit may also be transferred as part of the sale. Nevertheless, your personal information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection law.</p>

<p><strong>Links, Advertisers, Third Party Sponsors &amp; Ad-Servers</strong><br>
Occasionally, the Site may contain links to other sites where information practices may be different to ours.

<p><strong>Facebook comment box (social plugin)</strong><br>
When you’re logged into Facebook, the comment box plugin lets you comment on other websites immediately, without needing to create a new account or upload a new photo. Public commenting is a common practice across the Internet from articles, to TV clips, to restaurant reviews. By personalizing this experience, the comment box plugin allows for a moderated conversation, and easier ways to limit abuse and trolls.<br>
Our website uses Facebook's comment box, a social plugin (“plugin”) provided by the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). For a full list of all social Plugins please see http://developers.facebook.com/plugins.<br>
When you visit a page of our website that contains a social plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook servers. Facebook directly transfers the plugin content to your browser which embeds the latter into the website, enabling Facebook to receive information about you having accessed the respective page of our website. Thus we have no influence on the data gathered by the plugin and inform you according to our state of knowledge.<br>
The embedded plugins provide Facebook with the information that you have accessed the corresponding page of our website. If you are logged into Facebook, your visit can be assigned to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking “Like”, or entering a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to Facebook and stored by it. Even if you are not logged into Facebook, there is possibility that the plugins transmits your IP-address to Facebook.<br>
For the information on the purpose and scope of data collection and procession by Facebook, as well as your rights in this respect and settings options for protecting your privacy please visit Facebook’s privacy policy: http://www.facebook.com/policy.php.<br>
If you are a Facebook member and do not want Facebook to connect the data concerning your visit to our website with your member data already stored by Facebook, please log off Facebook before entering our website. Further you can block Facebook social plugins by using add-ons for your browser, like the “Facebook Blocker“.</p>
