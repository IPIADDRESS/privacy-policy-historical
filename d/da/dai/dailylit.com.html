<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
</div>

<div class="faq">

<p>We take the privacy of your personal information very seriously. This Privacy Policy describes 
how we treat the information we collect when you visit our Web site and/or register to for the DailyLit
services. Please read this policy carefully.</p>

<h3>Your E-mail Address</h3>

<p>In order to send you books by email, we need your e-mail address (duh). We do not require any
other personal information. We may occasionally send you e-mails that are not part of a book, for instance,
to notify you of changes to DailyLit or to suggest other books you might enjoy.</p>

<p>DailyLit will never sell, rent or share your e-mail address with any third parties for marketing 
purposes without your express permission.</p>

<p>We currently process the sending of DailyLit emails ourselves, but in the future might use a third
party e-mail provider, in which case we need to share your e-mail address with that provider, but 
exclusively for the purpose of delivering our e-mail.</p>

<p>We may also disclose your e-mail address as required by law.</p>


<h3>Usage Information and Optional Personal Information</h3>

<p>DailyLit keeps track of your subscriptions, including which books you are reading and how far along
you are with these.  We may also ask you for optional personal information, such as your name, your age, 
and so on.</p>

<p>DailyLit will never sell, rent or share your usage and optional personal information, with any third
parties for marketing purposes without your express permission.</p>

<p>We may use this information to improve DailyLit, customize your experience, show you more relevant ads,
suggest books to read, etc.</p>

<p>We may also share this information in anonymous, aggregate form.  Anonymous means without your e-mail
address or any other information that personally identifies you.  Aggregate means added, averaged or 
otherwise combined across a number of users so as to prevent identification of individual users.</p>

<p>We may also disclose this information as required by law.</p>


<h3>Review and Access</h3>

<p>Upon your request, we will provide you with a representation of the information we have currently stored about you. 
You will have an opportunity to correct or delete this information within the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>


<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>Like most sites, DailyLit makes use of browser "cookies." Cookies are small text files placed on your 
computer's hard disk by our server. They allow us to better customize our site and to store preference 
information (e.g., at what time of the day you like to receive your DailyLit e-mail). DailyLit will never 
use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to our site or services.</p>


<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>

<p>As part of the service, DailyLit may create links allowing you to access third party sites. 
DailyLit is not responsible for the content that appears on those sites and does not endorse these 
sites. Please consult those sites' individual privacy policies in order to determine how they treat 
user information.</p>


<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>DailyLit may update this policy at any time for any reason. If there are any material changes 
to how we handle personal information we will send a notice to your email address and/or temporarily 
place a prominent notice on our Web site.
