  <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
</div>
<div class="privacy_body">
  <p>We take the privacy of your personal information very
  seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the
  information we collect when you visit our Web site and/or register
  for DailyLit services. Please read this policy carefully.</p>
  <h3>YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS</h3>
  <p>In order to send you books by email, we need your e-mail
  address. We may occasionally send you e-mails that are not part of a
  book - for instance, to notify you of changes to DailyLit or to
  suggest other books you might enjoy.</p>
  <p>DailyLit does not collect personally identifiable information
  from children under the age of 13. If you believe that a child has
  provided DailyLit with personally identifiable information without
  the consent of his or her parent or guardian, please contact us at
  support@dailylit.com. If DailyLit becomes aware that a child under
  age 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we
  will delete such information.</p>
  <p>DailyLit will never sell, rent, or share your e-mail address with
  any third parties for marketing purposes without your express
  permission.</p>
  <p>We currently process the sending of DailyLit emails through a
  third party e-mail provider (SendGrid). We need to share your e-mail
  address with this third party provider in order to get your email
  subscriptions to you, but we will share this information exclusively
  for the purpose of delivering our e-mail.</p>
  <p>We may also disclose your e-mail address as required by law.</p>
  <p>You can remove your email address from DailyLit by deleting your
  account. To delete your account, simply go to your profile and click
  on "Settings." From there, click on "Account Settings," then click
  on the "Delete Your Account" link.</p>
  <h3>BILLING INFORMATION</h3>
  <p>Subscriptions to certain copyrighted books on DailyLit require
  payment via credit card. In order to process the payment we need
  billing information, including your name, credit card number, and
  credit card expiration date. We may also ask for your address and
  your card security code. We currently use a third party (Stripe) to
  process and store this information. We need to share your billing
  information with this third party provider in order to process and
  store your billing information, but we will share this information
  exclusively for this purpose.</p>
  <p>DailyLit will never sell or rent your billing information to
  third parties. We will not share your billing information with third
  parties other than for purposes of processing the card
  transaction.</p>
  <p>We may disclose your billing information as required by law.</p>
  <h3>USAGE INFORMATION AND OPTIONAL PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
  <p>DailyLit keeps track of your subscriptions, including which books
  you are reading and how far along you are with these. We also ask
  you for your location, so that we can appropriately set the timezone
  associated with your subscriptions.</p>
  <p>Any other information we ask for is entirely optional. We ask for
  your name so that a name will show up along with any comments or
  reviews you leave, or any posts you make in the forums. You may
  choose not to disclose your name or otherwise provide a username. We
  also ask you for optional personal information, such as your
  birthdate, your interests, and your gender. We may use this
  information to improve DailyLit, customize your experience, show you
  more relevant ads, suggest books to read, etc. </p>
  <p>DailyLit will never sell, rent or share your usage and personal
  information, with any third parties for marketing purposes without
  your express permission.</p>
  <p>We may also share this information in anonymous, aggregate
  form. Anonymous means without your e-mail address or any other
  information that personally identifies you. Aggregate means added,
  averaged or otherwise combined across a number of users so as to
  prevent identification of individual users.</p>
  <p>We may also disclose this information as required by law.</p>
  <h3>REVIEW AND ACCESS</h3>
  <p>Upon your request, we will provide you with a representation of
  the information we have currently stored about you. You will have an
  opportunity to correct or delete this information within the terms
  of this Privacy Policy.</p>
  <h3>COOKIES</h3>
  <p>Like most sites, DailyLit makes use of browser "cookies." Cookies
  are small text files placed on your computer's hard disk by our
  server. They allow us to better customize our site and to store
  preference information. DailyLit will never use cookies to retrieve
  information from a computer that is unrelated to our site or
  services.</p>
  <h3>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h3>
  <p>As part of the service, DailyLit may create links allowing you to
  access third party sites. DailyLit is not responsible for the
  content that appears on those sites and does not endorse these
  sites. Please consult those sites' individual privacy policies in
  order to determine how they treat user information.</p>
  <h3>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
  <p>DailyLit may update this policy at any time for any reason. If
  there are any material changes to how we handle personal information
  we will send a notice to your email address and/or temporarily place
  a prominent notice on our website.</p>
