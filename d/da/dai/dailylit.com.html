<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
</div>
<div class="privacy_body">
<p>We take the privacy of your personal information very
seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the
information we collect when you visit our Web site and/or register
for DailyLit services. Please read this policy carefully.</p>
<h3>YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS</h3>
<p>In order to send you books by email, we need your e-mail
address. We may occasionally send you e-mails that are not part of a
book - for instance, to notify you of changes to DailyLit or to
suggest other books you might enjoy.</p>
<p>DailyLit does not collect personally identifiable information
from children under the age of 13. If you believe that a child has
provided DailyLit with personally identifiable information without
the consent of his or her parent or guardian, please contact us at
support@dailylit.com. If DailyLit becomes aware that a child under
age 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we
will delete such information.</p>
<p>DailyLit will never sell, rent, or share your e-mail address with
any third parties for marketing purposes without your express
permission.</p>
<p>We currently process the sending of DailyLit emails through a
third party e-mail provider (SendGrid). We need to share your e-mail
address with this third party provider in order to get your email
subscriptions to you, but we will share this information exclusively
for the purpose of delivering our e-mail.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your e-mail address as required by law.</p>
<p>You can remove your email address from DailyLit by deleting your
account. To delete your account, simply go to your profile and click
on "Settings." From there, click on "Account Settings," then click
on the "Delete Your Account" link.</p>
<h3>BILLING INFORMATION</h3>
<p>Subscriptions to certain copyrighted books on DailyLit require
payment via credit card. In order to process the payment we need
billing information, including your name, credit card number, and
credit card expiration date. We may also ask for your address and
your card security code. We currently use a third party (Stripe) to
process and store this information. We need to share your billing
information with this third party provider in order to process and
store your billing information, but we will share this information
exclusively for this purpose.</p>
<p>DailyLit will never sell or rent your billing information to
third parties. We will not share your billing information with third
parties other than for purposes of processing the card
transaction.</p>
<p>We may disclose your billing information as required by law.</p>
<h3>USAGE INFORMATION AND OPTIONAL PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>DailyLit keeps track of your subscriptions, including which books
you are reading and how far along you are with these. We also ask
you for your location, so that we can appropriately set the timezone
associated with your subscriptions.</p>
<p>Any other information we ask for is entirely optional. We ask for
your name so that a name will show up along with any comments or
reviews you leave, or any posts you make in the forums. You may
choose not to disclose your name or otherwise provide a username. We
also ask you for optional personal information, such as your
birthdate, your interests, and your gender. We may use this
information to improve DailyLit, customize your experience, show you
more relevant ads, suggest books to read, etc. </p>
<p>DailyLit will never sell, rent or share your usage and personal
information, with any third parties for marketing purposes without
your express permission.</p>
<p>We may also share this information in anonymous, aggregate
form. Anonymous means without your e-mail address or any other
information that personally identifies you. Aggregate means added,
averaged or otherwise combined across a number of users so as to
prevent identification of individual users.</p>
<p>We may also disclose this information as required by law.</p>
<h3>REVIEW AND ACCESS</h3>
<p>Upon your request, we will provide you with a representation of
the information we have currently stored about you. You will have an
opportunity to correct or delete this information within the terms
of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>COOKIES</h3>
<p>Like most sites, DailyLit makes use of browser "cookies." Cookies
are small text files placed on your computer's hard disk by our
server. They allow us to better customize our site and to store
preference information. DailyLit will never use cookies to retrieve
information from a computer that is unrelated to our site or
services.</p>
<h3>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h3>
<p>As part of the service, DailyLit may create links allowing you to
access third party sites. DailyLit is not responsible for the
content that appears on those sites and does not endorse these
sites. Please consult those sites' individual privacy policies in
order to determine how they treat user information.</p>
<h3>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p>DailyLit may update this policy at any time for any reason. If
there are any material changes to how we handle personal information
we will send a notice to your email address and/or temporarily place
a prominent notice on our website.</p>
