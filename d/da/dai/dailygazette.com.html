<p><font size="2" face="verdana,georgia,arial,helvetica"></font></p><blockquote><font size="2" face="verdana,georgia,arial,helvetica">

The Gazette Newspapers is committed to protecting consumer privacy online. We believe
that greater protection of personal privacy on the Web will not only
protect consumers, but also increase consumer confidence and ultimately
their participation in online activities. At DailyGazette.net, we intend to give
you as much control as possible over your personal information.<p>

The purpose of our policy is to inform you about the types of information
we gather about you when you visit our site(s), how we may use that
information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have
regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information.</p><p>

Our site(s) may contain links to other Web sites, including Web sites
directed to children. We have no control over the privacy practices or the
content of any of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors or other
sites to which we provide links from our sites. You should check the
applicable privacy policy of the Web site sponsor when linking to other Web
sites.</p><p>
</p></font></blockquote><font size="2" face="verdana,georgia,arial,helvetica"><b><b>
I. Information We Collect</b></b><p><b><b>
</b></b></p><blockquote>
We may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information,
including your e-mail address, postal address, home or work telephone
number, credit card number. If you choose to give
us personal information via the Internet that we 
may need -- to correspond with you, process an order or provide you with a
subscription, for example -- it is our intent to let you know how we will
use such information.<p>

Like many other commercial sites, our site(s) may utilize a standard
technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our site is
used. Cookies were designed to help a Web site recognize a user's browser
as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may
have been set while the user was browsing the site. A cookie cannot
retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on a computer virus, or
capture your e-mail address. Our Web site(s) may use cookies to enhance
your visit. Cookies can securely store a user's password, personalize home
pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of
selections, such as those selected in a "shopping cart." Our cookies may
collect your domain name and track your selections through our Web pages.
We only use "cookies" to gather the information indicated in this policy
and do not use cookies to gather personal identifying information about you
without your consent.</p><p>



</p></blockquote><b>
II. Disclosure to Third Parties</b><p><b>
</b></p><blockquote>
We do not share personal identifying information with any third party
without your permission. We disclose only in aggregate form our statistical
analyses or demographics of users to third parties, such as advertisers or
other business partners. In some instances, we operate shared Web sites
with businesses affiliated with us. Our privacy policy will apply to these
Web sites, and our affiliates adhere to our privacy policy and will not
share personal information with any third party without your permission.
PLEASE BE AWARE that when you voluntarily disclose personal information
(such as your name, e-mail address) in chat areas or bulletin boards to
third parties, that information may be collected by others outside the
control of us and may result in unsolicited messages from others.<p>
</p></blockquote><b>
III. Security of Information</b><p><b>
</b></p><blockquote>
We use our best efforts to ensure the security of personal information
submitted by users. When collecting credit card information for online
purchases, we offer secured-server transactions that encrypt your
information in transit to thwart someone from intercepting it and misusing
it. When we collect other information from our users, it is stored in an
area where the general public does not have access to it.<p>
</p></blockquote><b>
IV. Use of Materials</b><p><b>
</b></p><blockquote>
The right to download and store or output the materials in our site(s) is
granted for the user's personal use only, and materials may not be
reproduced in any edited form. Any other reproduction, transmission,
performance, display or editing of these materials by any means mechanical
or electronic without the express written permission of us is strictly
prohibited. Users wishing to obtain permission to reprint or reproduce any

IV. Associated Press</b><p><b>

Associated Press text, photo, graphic, audio and/or video material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed 
directly or indirectly in any medium. Neither these AP materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use.
