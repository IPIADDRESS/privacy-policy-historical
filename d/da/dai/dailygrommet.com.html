            </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            Daily Grommet is concerned about protecting your personal information online, and we set forth this policy with this in mind – we won’t do anything that we wouldn’t want anyone else to do with our own personal information.  In this section, we’ll describe our policies for collection and use of information at www.dailygrommet.com.  Please review these policies for your own comfort, and proceed to use the site if you agree with the terms.  By virtue of using the site, you are agreeing with our policies and terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to modify this policy in the future, although we don’t foresee the need for that at present.  Any updates will be posted on this page, and we suggest that you visit this page on occasion to ensure you are comfortable with our policies.  We’ll date the policy so that you can know when this was last updated.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Data We Collect
          </h2>
          <p>
            Here is what we collect on our site:  primarily information that is not identifiable to any one individual.  For example, when guests visit our site, we keep track of pages were visited, in what order, where the guest went to next – all this information is aggregated and then we use it to tell us which of our pages are interesting to our guests and which ones are not.  To get a little technical, we collect the IP addresses, operating system and browser software for the guests, and we use ‘cookies’ to track non-personally identifiable information regarding you.  Cookies make it possible for us to recognize your browser when you visit dailygrommet.com and then makes it possible for you to visit various pages on our site without having to log in multiple times.  Ultimately this saves you time and allows us to personalize your experience on Daily Grommet.  To make this possible, you have to set your browser to accept cookies.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also collect personally identifiable information. In general, our site uses an order form, an email sign up form and the registration form so that you can actively participate in discussions about our daily offering.  These forms require that you provide us with personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, and credit card number (for purchases only)).
          </p>
          <p>
            Further, when you use the site to purchase a product or service as a gift we will collect from you personally identifiable information regarding the gift recipient or potential gift recipient.
          </p>
          <h2>
            How we use the information: Non-personally identifiable information
          </h2>
          <p>
            The non-personally identifiable information that we collect at Daily Grommet will be used to help us improve our site performance.  We’ll use IP addresses and the pages that customers visit on our site to give us some insight into broad site traffic patterns and trends, and that will help us better design and operate our site for improved customer experience.  We may also aggregate the statistical data about usage and trends and share this with business partners to help improve their services and products that we use and offer to our customers.
          </p>
          <h2>
            How we use the information: Personally identifiable information
          </h2>
          <p>
            The personally identifiable information collected from you while you are making purchases will be used to ship product to you, to contact you about your orders and when needed, to check with you regarding your satisfaction about your Daily Grommet experience, to ask for your input on ways that we can better serve you and products and services that you may want, to provide you with service changes and updates.  The financial information that you provide (your credit card information, etc.) will be used to charge you for your purchases.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will not share your email address with other parties.  On occasion, we may contact you with an offer from another party, but only if we think that the offer would be of some interest to you.
          </p>
          <h2>Gift Recipients</h2>
          <p>
            In the same way that we will use your personally identifiable information to ship products to you, we will collect some information – mainly the shipping address – about people to whom you send a Grommet.  Same terms apply to these contacts – we will not share these email addresses with other parties but may contact them with offers from other parties, again only if we think that the offer might be of some interest to them.
          </p>
          <h2>Third Party Providers</h2>
          <p>
            We have a number of external companies, third parties, who work with us to help us do what we do.  This includes a third party logistics operator, a software development firm that develops our website, financial service providers who enable the funds flows, among others.  These parties have access to some of the personally identifiable information as needed for them to carry out their role in providing services and products to you – such as shipping the products to you, billing your credit card, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, we may choose to work with some third parties to help us analyze our business operations and marketing.  As needed, we may share some information with them and will require that they treat this information in the same way that we do.  As it is with many things in life, we cannot be held responsible for the business practices or privacy policies of our partners.
          </p>
          <h2>Purchase of Company, Ownership Change</h2>
          <p>
            In the event that Daily Grommet or a significant part of Daily Grommet is sold to another organization, the acquiring organization may assume control of Daily Grommet customer and financial information.
          </p>
          <h2>Other Sharing</h2>
          <p>
            Subject to applicable law, Daily Grommet reserves the right to release information regarding any site visitor where the visitor is believed to be in violation of his or her obligations to us, and where the visitor is participating (or is suspected of participating) in any illegal activity.  Daily Grommet further reserves the right to release information in response to discovery requests and civil subpoenas, to protect the interests of Daily Grommet, our customers or others, and as otherwise permitted or required by law.
          </p>
          <h2>Links Outside of Daily Grommet</h2>
          <p>
            The Daily Grommet site, applications, and communications will frequently include links to other websites that will often not be Daily Grommet sites.  Daily Grommet is not responsible for any of the practices (privacy, data collection and use) associated with sites outside of Daily Grommet.  You may be best served to review the privacy practices and policies of these sites.
          </p>
          <h2>Information Security</h2>
          <p>
            In order to protect against the loss, misuse or modification of personally identifiable information within our control, Daily Grommet will use reasonable security measures to serve that end.  Users must recognize that it is impossible to guarantee 100% security when transmitting data over the Internet, so users provide all information at their own risk.
          </p>
          <h2>Onsite Communications and Posts</h2>
          <p>
            Daily Grommet reserves the right to delete, revise or refuse any comments or contributions that we consider to be offensive, spam, or not relevant to the discussion.  Daily Grommet is not responsible for user-submitted content although we intend to monitor this and remove contributions as noted above.
          </p>
          <p>
            In making posts, we ask that our visitors:
            </p><ul>
              <li>not post personal information (addresses, phone numbers, etc.),</li>
              <li>not post advertising (or thinly-veiled advertising),</li>
              <li>not post fabricated reviews (good or bad) of products you have not experienced yourself, and</li>
              <li>not post anything that is not suitable for a general population, including kids.  No need to use foul language, or innuendo, there are plenty of other places for this, but not at Daily Grommet.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <h2>Updating your Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            If you are a registered user at Daily Grommet, you can edit your profile and your personal information by visiting the Daily Grommet site and going to ‘My Account’ and log in and make the desired changes.
          </p>
          <h2>Contacting Us, Questions, Feedback</h2>
          <p>
            Please contact us directly if you have any questions about our policy, your experience on Daily Grommet or your observations about any violations of our policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please also contact Daily Grommet to share any feedback – positive, negative, critical, hopefully constructive – with us.  We are committed to delivering an exceptional experience to our customers, and we won’t have a business if we cannot serve our customers – so your input is useful, important and we want to hear it (even if it’s painful).
