<p><strong>2. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</strong></p>
<p>Any information you share such as your profile information (such as nickname, gender and location), information or content you submit, post, like or comment on, and your other activities on the Services will be accessible by other users of the Website and Services. Content that you create through or upload to the Website will by default be public and available to users of the Website and the Services. Similarly, if you comment on any Content (as defined in the <a href="https://daily.social/terms-of-use/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use</span></a>) on the Website or the Services, your comments will be public and available to users of the Website and the Services.</p>
<p>We may share data about our users or the use of the Website or Services with our advertisers and partners. This means that we may tell our advertisers general information about the characteristics of our user base, but we do not specifically identify a particular user or visitor by name or provide the user’s contact information. We may share your unique device ID and/or your location (based on opt-in location-based services, which rely upon a device’s GPS coordinates) with third parties, including advertisers and partners, or provide reports to such parties about the number of unique users who saw or clicked on their advertisements. We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information, among other things, allows third-party ad networks to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may disclose your information on a confidential basis to non-affiliated service providers we engage to perform services for Bigtree in connection with the Website and our provision of the Services. Information will be shared with such service providers only to the extent reasonably necessary for them to perform such services.</p>
<p>Regardless of any choices you make regarding any personally identifiable data you provide, we may preserve and disclose your information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in connection with any legal investigation, or by law or regulation, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>Regardless of any choices you make regarding any personally identifiable</p>
<p>data/information you provide, we may preserve and disclose your information</p>
<p>if we believe in good faith that it is reasonably necessary to protect the safety</p>
<p>of any person, to address fraud, security or technical issues, to protect</p>
<p>Bigtree’s rights or property, and/or to investigate or assist in preventing any</p>
<p>violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or our Terms of</p>
<p>Use.</p>
<p>We may share some or all of your information in connection with, or during</p>
<p>negotiation of, any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or</p>
<p>proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion</p>
<p>of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or</p>
<p>receivership, your information may also be transferred as a business asset. If</p>
<p>another company acquires our company, business or assets, that company</p>
<p>will possess the information collected by us and will assume the rights and</p>
<p>obligations regarding your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>(i) Creation Of Anonymous And Aggregated Data</p>
<p>We may create Anonymous Data (i.e., your personal information/data that has</p>
<p>been anonymized by or for Bigtree so that it does not allow a third party to</p>
<p>easily identify a specific individual) and/or Aggregated Data (i.e., your</p>
<p>information/data that has been combined by or for Bigtree into anonymous</p>
<p>groups of users where the groups are large enough to reasonably prevent</p>
<p>individual users from being identified) records from the information/data you</p>
<p>provide by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data</p>
<p>personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous and Aggregated Data</p>
<p>to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of</p>
<p>our Services and improve Website navigation. We reserve the right, in our</p>
<p>sole discretion, to use Anonymous and/or Aggregated Data for any purpose</p>
<p>and to disclose Anonymous and/or Aggregated Data to third parties for any</p>
<p>purpose.</p>
<p>3. SECURITY</p>
<p>We take reasonable steps to protect personally identifiable information from</p>
<p>loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
<p>But, you should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever completely</p>
<p>secure or error-free. In particular, messages sent to or from this Website may</p>
<p>not be secure. Please notify us as soon as possible if you suspect that there</p>
<p>is any breach of security.</p>
<p>4. ADVERTISING</p>
<p>Bigtree displays targeted advertisements. When an advertiser books an ad</p>
<p>placement on the Website, they are given the opportunity to choose their</p>
<p>audience by location, demographics, gender and any other non-personally</p>
<p>identifiable information we receive or collect from you.</p>
<p>By interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that</p>
<p>the advertiser may make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria</p>
<p>used to display the ad. Please note that this Privacy Policy in no way restricts</p>
<p>or limits our collection and use of aggregate information which is data we</p>
<p>collect about your use of our Website or about a group or category of services</p>
<p>or users, from which individual identities or other personally identifiable</p>
<p>information has been removed.</p>
<p>Advertisers may sometimes place their own cookies on your computer in</p>
<p>order to make their ads more effective.</p>
<p>Please remember that any personal information you provide on the linked</p>
<p>pages, ads you click on or other websites is subject to a third party’s privacy</p>
<p>policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such linked websites, ads you</p>
<p>click on or other website, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy</p>
<p>and security practices and policies of these websites or any other websites</p>
<p>that are linked to from our website. We encourage you to learn about their</p>
<p>privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with</p>
<p>personal information.</p>
<p>Also, third party ad networks may serve ads on our Website or provide ads via</p>
<p>our services and/or otherwise place cookies, web beacons or other devices or</p>
<p>technologies on our Platforms (or via our Services) to enable them to</p>
<p>automatically collect non-personal information about you and your visits to our</p>
<p>Website and to other websites, your IP address, your ISP and the browser</p>
<p>you use to visit our Website and other websites. Information collected may be</p>
<p>used, among other things, to analyze data, to deliver content and advertising</p>
<p>on our Website or other websites (including content and advertising that is</p>
<p>targeted to your interests), to determine the popularity of certain content, and</p>
<p>to better understand the usage and visitation of our Website and the other</p>
<p>websites tracked by these third parties. This Privacy Policy does not apply to,</p>
<p>and we are not responsible for, cookies or clear GIFs in third party ads, and</p>
<p>we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad</p>
<p>services to learn more about their use of cookies and other technologies.</p>
<p>5. EXCEPTION AND MODIFICATION/DELETION OF INFORMATION</p>
<p>Legal and Other Requirements – Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in</p>
<p>this Privacy Policy, we may disclose your information to a third party if we</p>
<p>believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or</p>
<p>legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or</p>
<p>technical issues; or to protect our rights and property.</p>
<p>6. PRIVACY POLICY UPDATES</p>

<p>without prior notice and at any time and if we change it materially, we will post</p>
<p>a revised version on this Website. Please check back periodically, and</p>
<p>especially before you provide any personally identifiable information to us. By</p>
<p>continuing to use the Services after changes are made, you agree to be</p>
<p>bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
