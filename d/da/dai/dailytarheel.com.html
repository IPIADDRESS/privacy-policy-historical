(Viacom International Inc., together with other subsidiaries, affiliates and related entities of Viacom International Inc., including, without limitation, MTV Networks, a division of Viacom International Inc., are referred to as "Affiliates"). </p>

	<h3>Overview</h3>

	<p>This Privacy Policy is intended to explain our privacy practices and inform you as to: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>The kinds of Personal Information we collect from users of the Site and how that information is collected;</li>
		<li>How we use your Personal Information; </li>
		<li>The circumstances under which we disclose Personal Information to third parties;</li>
		<li>How you can access, update or delete any Personal Information collected about you by us; and</li>		
		<li>The mechanisms we have implemented to protect your Personal Information. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>This Site is offered and made available only to users 16 years of age or older who reside in the United States of America, its territories and possessions (“U.S.”). <b>If you are not yet 16 years old, or do not reside in the U.S., please discontinue using the Site immediately, or if, for any reason, you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the features, activities and services that require you to provide your Personal Information.</b>  This Privacy Policy is a part of the terms and conditions which are set forth in our <u><a href="/user/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a></u>. Any terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given in the Terms of Use Agreement.  Both the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement are legally binding on all users.  </p>
	<p>We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting without advance notice to you.  Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting.  Notice of material changes to either document will be posted on the Site’s homepage.  However, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement often for updates.  We may also e-mail you, at our discretion, about these changes.</p>
	<p>We are committed to protecting users' privacy.  Keeping the Personal Information you share with us on the Site secure and ensuring your understanding of how we collect, use, disclose and maintain your Personal Information is important to us.

	<p>If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if a company has a Privacy Policy that gives either an opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as “unsubscribe”) or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. </p>
	<p>This Site qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes.  Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. </p>
	<p>If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at <u><a href="mailto:feedback@collegepublisher.com">feedback@collegepublisher.com</a></u>, or you may contact us via regular mail at: </p>

We request that our operational service providers follow the same policy. </p>
	<p><b>8. Phishing:</b>  Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers’ personal identity data and financial account credentials.  “Phishers” use ‘spoofed’ e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Personal Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords, and social security numbers. <b> WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD!</b> If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site’s Privacy Administrator at <u><a href="mailto:feedback@collegepublisher.com">feedback@collegepublisher.com</a></u>, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.</p>
	<p><b>9. Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information:</b>  Generally, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information collected by this Site.  You may also correct factual inaccuracies.  However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as your email address, cannot be deleted and can only be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information; certain Personal Information, such as email address, cannot be deleted but can be modified.  Deletion of certain Personal Information, such as username, may result in suspension of your account or termination of any registration you may have made.  To review, update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information collected by the Site, please send an e-mail to feedback@collegepublisher.com or written mail to College Publisher; 100 City Hall Plaza, Level 2; Boston, MA 02108, including your name, email address and the information to be changed. </p>
	<p>If you wish to review Personal Information collected for Promotions such as contests and sweepstakes, you will need to contact the Site’s Privacy Administrator via email with a request at <u><a href="mailto:feedback@collegepublisher.com">feedback@collegepublisher.com</a></u> and be prepared to provide verification of your identity.  Personal Information collected for certain entries are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user’s request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.  </p>
	<p>Children under the age of 13 that are unknowingly registered on the Site are in violation of the <u><a href="/user/terms">Terms of Use</a></u> Agreement.  Parents (including legal guardians) of children that registered on the Site in violation of the Terms of Use Agreement who wish to terminate their child’s membership must use their child’s User ID to gain direct access to the account, and select “EDIT ACCOUNT” or alternatively, you can send us an email to the Site’s Privacy Administrator and provide us with your child’s User ID and request to terminate your child’s account and registration.  We will not allow direct access to a user’s account and Personal Information by any person without the user’s User ID  (please see above for how to change your preferences or the information associated with your account).  If a parent does not have his or her child’s User ID, the parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the parent’s name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child’s name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child’s date of birth.  The parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent of the ineligible child.  Company will send a confirming email to the parent via the email address provided to verify that the parent wishes to terminate his or her child’s account and registration.  The parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address.  Company will then terminate the child’s account but will notify the child of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request. </p>
	<p>We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including without limitation, a registered user, of any services, features or functions of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access the user’s account or any services, features or functions. And if the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries. </p>
	<p><b>10.
