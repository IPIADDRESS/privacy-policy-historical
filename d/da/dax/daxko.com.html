			<font size="3"><b>Privacy Policy</b></font><br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Data Ownership</b></font><br>
			DAXKO services are designed to provide confidential online
			registration and payment processing, Web site design and hosting, and membership
			management to credible organizations, not to serve as façades for collecting
			private consumer data for re-sale or sharing.<br>
			<br>
			All participant data for online registrations and membership management is
			solely and exclusively owned by the respective organization providing such
			service through DAXKO. As part of our commitment to participants’ privacy,
			DAXKO relinquishes rights to disclose any personal information provided by the
			participants.<br>
			<br>
			DAXKO will not sell, give, lend or otherwise provide personal data from any
			organization to any company, institution, individual or other entity other than
			the account administrator of the particular organization.<br>
			<br>

			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Data Encryption During Transmission</b></font><br>
			DAXKO is committed to providing the highest level of security to all data
			transactions conducted through use of our site. Our Internet professionals
			utilize the latest security technologies and adhere to strict internal security
			procedures to ensure the maximum safety, privacy and security of personal and
			financial information during all stages of the process.<br>
			<br>
			Transmission of personal information, payment information and all other data
			provided by users is protected by SSL 128-bit encryption, and all data stored on
			our servers is safeguarded using the latest security technologies.<br>
			<br>

			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Data Storage</b></font><br>
			All registration and membership data is securely stored within a large-scale
			database management system. Our servers are physically located in a secure data
			center, a protected building with extensive security features including
			biometric palm readers, video monitoring and card key access.<br>
			<br>
			The data center also includes extensive fault tolerant systems for power,
			including backup diesel generators and quadruple redundant Internet lines. In
			addition, DAXKO’s servers are configured and tested regularly by certified “ethical
			hackers” to ensure that no security loopholes in our system architecture
			exist.<br>
			<br>
			
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b></font><br>
			When using DAXKO to register for a membership,
			event or donation to an organization, you will be asked to submit “personally
			identifiable information” during the course of that process.<br>
			<br>
			The number and nature of requests for this personally identifiable information
			are determined by the organization hosting the membership, event or donation.
			The questions are designed by the organization to fulfill the event or service
			for which you are registering and can be optional or required. Questions
			designated as requiring an answer are denoted by a red asterisk and are
			designated as required by the organization, not DAXKO.<br>
			<br>
			
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Access To and Use of Personally Identifiable Information</b></font><br>
			DAXKO does not engage in the sale or distribution of personally identifiable information 
			for direct marketing, sales or other purposes. Your personally identifiable information 
			is stored securely by DAXKO and is accessible only to administrators of the organization 
			with whom you are signing up and to appropriate employees of DAXKO, for purposes of 
			rendering the requested service for which you completed the form. In addition to pledging 
			that DAXKO will not use your personally identifiable information for uses other than
			those defined within this statement, DAXKO requires that all organizations using
			our systems agree to our Operating Terms and Conditions. This agreement
			stipulates that the organization will also abide by these restrictions on the
			collection and usage of your personally identifiable information.<br>
			<br>
			DAXKO will occasionally use aggregate information to produce reports tracking
			usage trends on the site and to improve site design. We will not use data for
			this or any other purpose in a way that would risk the privacy of personally
			identifiable information.<br>
			<br>
			
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Security of Personally Identifiable Information</b></font><br>
			DAXKO has taken every step to ensure that your data
			is secure and private during the process. Your data is encrypted and transmitted
			using Secure Socket Layering (SSL) and is then stored and protected in a secure
			storage facility.<br>
			<br>
			
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Usage of Cookies</b></font><br>
			DAXKO uses "cookies" to help you
			personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small amount of data, which
			often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from
			a web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Each web
			site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences
			allow it, but your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has
			already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. A cookie is a
			text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot
			be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are
			uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain
			that issued the cookie to you.<br>
			<br>
			One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to
			save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have
			returned to a specific page. For example, if an administrator logs in with his
			user name and password, a cookie helps DAXKO to recall your specific information
			on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal
			information each visit. When you return to the same DAXKO Web site, the
			information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the
			features you customized.<br>
			<br>
			You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
			automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to
			decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be
			able to fully experience all the features of DAXKO’s services.<br>
			<br>
			
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b></font><br>
			DAXKO will not sell or rent your personally
			identifiable information to anyone. All participant data is solely and
			exclusively owned by the respective organization providing service through DAXKO.
			As part of our commitment to participants’ privacy, DAXKO relinquishes rights
			to disclose any personal information provided by participants.<br>
			<br>
			Your mailing address will be shared with your credit card company in order to
			verify that you are an authorized user. Your telephone number will be used if
			there are any customer service issues that might need to be addressed.<br>
			<br>
			DAXKO will not sell, give, lend or otherwise provide personal data from any
			organization’s accounts to any company, institution, individual or other
			entity other than the account administrator of the particular organization.<br>
			<br>
			
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>E-mail communications from our site</b></font><br>
			Your e-mail address is stored so that we can send
			the account administrator your user name and password in case you forget or lose
			it. Depending on the client organization they might send special announcements
			and reminders relevant to the event you are attending only. DAXKO will not send
			end users of client organizations any unsolicited information, including e-mail.<br>
			<br>
			New client organizations will receive a DAXKO welcome letter explaining the
			features provided by the services. DAXKO will also send periodic client letters
			to announce important service changes, new features, technical issue updates and
			news about other DAXKO products and services, which you may opt out of by
			contacting your account manager. DAXKO may also contact you to conduct research
			about your opinion of current and prospective services via optional e-mail
			surveys.<br>
			<br>
			
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Opting Out of Optional E-mail Communications</b></font><br>
			As an end user or client of DAXKO’s services, you
			have the ability at any time to opt out of optional e-mail communications by
			contacting the administrator of the particular organization holding the DAXKO
			account.<br>
			<br>
			
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Testimonials</b></font><br>
			Testimonials appearing on any of DAXKO’s Web sites are the personal opinions and 
			comments of existing clients and are of no liability to DAXKO.<br>
			<br>
			
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Third party services</b></font><br>
			If you pay online for a membership, event or
			donation, credit card funds are processed through Verisign (http://www.verisign.com).
			Verisign will transmit the transaction information you provide to transaction
			processors and merchant banks. By registering online you agree that DAXKO will,
			if a credit card transaction is selected, provide your information to Verisign,
			its transaction processors and merchant banks. Verisign has implemented security
			systems consisting of encryption and "Firewall" technologies for the
			transmission of information over the Internet. Neither DAXKO nor Verisign,
			however, guarantees that such security is secure or impregnable and neither
			DAXKO nor Verisign will be responsible in the event of infiltration of
			Verisign's security systems. Neither DAXKO nor Verisign is responsible for the
			security of transmission data or information or any other information stored on
			DAXKO's servers, our licensed partner's servers, or any other party's servers.<br>
			<br>
			
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Changes/Updates</b></font><br>
			As an end user of DAXKO’s services, you have the
			ability at any time to change any of your personal information by contacting the
			administrator of the particular organization holding the DAXKO account.<br>
			<br>
			
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Participant Information</b></font><br>
			By executing our Operating Terms when creating a
			DAXKO account, you agree to treat all information or material transmitted by
			participants to you confidentially and not to use that information, without
			their prior written consent, for any other purpose other than in connection with
			providing the services to the participant for which they registered.<br>
			<br>
			
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Organization Information</b></font><br>
			In order to process your organization’s request
			for an account, DAXKO requires the organization’s name, contact’s name,
			contact’s phone number, contact’s e-mail address and the physical address of
			the organization.<br>
			<br>
			To expedite communication between DAXKO and your organization, you should also
			provide the contact’s job title, fax number and the organization’s Web site.
			Entering this information is optional and omitting it will not adversely effect
			your organization’s account application.<br>
			<br>
			
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Access To and Use of Organization Information</b></font><br>
			All information submitted by your organization to the site 
			<a href="http://www.daxko.com"><b>www.DAXKO.com</b></a> is collected and housed 
			by DAXKO in our secure data storage facility. DAXKO does
			not engage in the sale or redistribution of individually identifiable
			information collected from your organization through our site.<br>
			<br>
			We will occasionally use aggregate data collected through our site to produce
			generalized reports, but we will not use the data in a way that would expose an
			organization’s identity. We will share aggregate demographic information with
			our client organizations. Individually identifiable information is used
			internally by DAXKO only to create and manage your account and is not shared
			with any other entity.<br>
			<br>
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Security of Organization Information</b></font><br>
			DAXKO has taken every step to ensure that your data
			is secure and private during the online process. Your data is encrypted and
			transmitted using 128-bit Secure Socket Layering (SSL) and is then stored and
			protected in a secure storage facility.<br>
			<br>
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Changing Your Organization Information</b></font><br>
			If you would like to review or change the
			information submitted to DAXKO, log on with your user name and password, and
			then select Manage Account from the menu.<br>
			<br>
			
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Changes to the Privacy Policy</b></font><br>
			If we are going to use your personally identifiable
			information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we
			will notify you via e-mail. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use
			your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material
			changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already
			stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site
			notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will
			also e-mail users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying
			them of the changes in our privacy practices.<br>
			<br>
			
			<font color="#4a00a5"><b>Questions About the Privacy Policy</b></font><br>
			We encourage you to contact us with any questions or comments regarding our
			policy.
