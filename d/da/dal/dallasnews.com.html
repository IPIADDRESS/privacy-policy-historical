      <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This Privacy 
      Policy discloses the general privacy practices for www.dallasnews.com.<br>
      <br>
      Belo Interactive is committed to respecting the privacy rights of visitors 
      to any of the Belo Interactive web sites. While visiting Belo Interactive 
      web sites (collectively, the "Site"), we may ask you to register and/or 
      provide information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") 
      for purposes of interacting with the Site. To further the protection of 
      your Personal Information, Belo Interactive has adopted a set of information 
      management guidelines (outlined below) which serve as the basis for our 
      customer and advertiser relationships. These guidelines have been developed 
      with the recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and 
      that underlying business models are still not established. Accordingly, 
      guidelines are subject to change. Any such changes will be posted on this 
      page. Please see the Effective Date stated at the conclusion of this Policy.<br>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#990000">Information Collected</font></b><br>
      <br>
      <b>What are Cookies? </b>There is a technology called "cookies" which can 
      be used to provide you with tailored information from a web site. A cookie 
      is an element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may 
      then be stored on your system. This element of data is a piece of text, 
      not a program. The Site can only access the information from a cookie sent 
      by the Site. We cannot access other cookies sent by other web sites or the 
      information contained therein. Additionally, we cannot learn your email 
      address or any other information about you through the use of a cookie. 
      The only way we would learn such information is if you specifically submit 
      that information to us, for example, through our registration system, by 
      entering a sweepstakes or promotion, etc. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Why do the Belo Sites use cookies?</b> Belo Interactive uses cookies 
      to track usage of the Site and further customize your experience when you 
      are visiting the Site. By tracking usage, we can best determine what features 
      of the Site best serve the users. We never give out information to others 
      about individual usage. However, we do provide our advertisers with aggregate 
      information about our users, such as "2,000 people viewed your ad today."<br>
      <br>
      <b>May I decline to accept a cookie? </b>On those pages of the Site that 
      do not require registration, you may decline to accept cookies sent by the 
      Site by selecting an option on your browser to reject cookies. However, 
      some portions of the Site may require registration in order to access those 
      areas. In such case, we ask that you register and provide us with basic 
      information on our registration page. Cookies enable our server to know 
      that you are a registered user; therefore, our registration system requires 
      that you accept the cookies from the Sites. Other sites linked to the Site 
      may also send cookies; however we do not control such activities. <br>
      <br>
      <b>What benefits do I receive from cookies?</b> Overall, the use of cookies 
      helps to give you a customized experience at the Site. Through the use of 
      cookies, we'll know what's working and what's not. That information is then 
      used to keep our Site fresh and relevant to you the user. Cookies also allow 
      you to avoid retyping your user id each time you access the Site, as well 
      as personalize any online services we provide to you. <br>
      <b><br>
      What happens with the information collected in a cookie? </b>We use an advertising 
      server developed by a third party to display ads on the Site. Some of these 
      ads may contain cookies that are set by third parties (i.e. advertising 
      agencies or advertising clients). We do not have access to these cookies 
      or any information that they may contain; please contact the advertiser 
      for more information on these cookies. <br>
      <br>
      <b>IP Addresses: </b>Belo Interactive does log IP addresses, or the location 
      of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting 
      purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#990000">Use of Personal Information</font> </b><br>
      <br>
      Belo Interactive may match aggregated user information with third party 
      data. Also, Belo Interactive discloses aggregated user statistics in order 
      to describe our services to potential advertisers, partners and other third 
      parties, and for other lawful purposes. Additionally, Belo Interactive will 
      use reasonable efforts to ensure that only our employees with a "need to 
      know" will have access to your information. We do not release personal information 
      about you as an individual to third parties.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted, however, that this Privacy Policy only addresses the 
      use and dissemination of information that we collect from you. To the extent 
      that you disclose any information to other parties, whether through, for 
      example, on-line auctions, chat rooms, personal ads, or the like, or through 
      other web sites throughout the Internet, different policies may apply. Since 
      Belo Interactive does not control the privacy policies of third parties, 
      you are subject to the privacy customs and policies, if any, of that third 
      party, and Belo Interactive shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination 
      of your private information by that third party. Therefore, we encourage 
      you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.<br>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#990000">Links to Other Materials</font></b><br>
      <br>
      If any link is offered connecting you to a third party web site, it is as 
      an accommodation to the respective third party site owner and without charge. 
      Third party sites linked to and from the Site are not necessarily under 
      the control of Belo Interactive. Belo Interactive shall have no responsibilities 
      or liabilities whatsoever for the content or privacy practices of any such 
      linked site or any link or linking program at any time. Belo Interactive 
      does not necessarily endorse companies (or related products or services) 
      to or from which the Site is linked. If you decide to access any of the 
      third party sites linked to the Site, you do so entirely at your own risk. 
      Belo Interactive hereby disclaims any rights to trademarks, service marks, 
      trade names, logos, copyrights, patents, domain names or other intellectual 
      property interests of third parties. <br>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#990000">Children's Privacy</font></b><br>
      <br>
      Belo Interactive cares about the safety of children and their use of the 
      Internet. Therefore, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection 
      Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request or solicit personally identifiable 
      information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental 
      consent. In the event that we receive actual knowledge that we have collected 
      such personal information without the requisite and verifiable parental 
      consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as 
      is practical. <br>
      <b><br>
      <font color="#990000">Effective Date and Changes</font></b><br>
      <b><br>
      This Privacy Policy is effective as of April 11, 2000.</b> Belo Interactive 
      reserves the right to modify the terms of this policy at any time and in 
      our sole discretion, by posting a change notice to this page. Your continued 
      use of the Site following our posting of a change notice will constitute 
      binding acceptance of those changes. </font></td>
