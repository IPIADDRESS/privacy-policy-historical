This privacy policy applies to all Damntheradio related websites and applications such as those built on popular social networking sites.

This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.


</p><h2>INFORMATION DAMNTHERADIO GATHERS AND TRACKS</h2>

Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are submissions to become a user of our applications, to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys.</p><p>

Information Damntheradio gathers personal information the users directly provide on our websites.  Damntheradio collects personal information from our users as a user of our applications.  The information we collect may include names, email addresses, demographic information and any other information.  We may supplement this information with information collected from other companies.  This information allows us to better tailor our content to our users' and readers' needs and to help our advertisers, sponsors, and vendors better understand the demographics of our users and audience.</p><p>

 When a user visits our websites or uses our applications some information may be automatically collected.

That information includes your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language, and referring website addresses. We may also collect information about your computer's operating system and information about your usage and activity on our websites.</p><p>

Electronic newsletters policy (Dispatches)</p><p>

We may offer a free electronic newsletter to users. Damntheradio gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration of our application.</p><p>

2. Message boards/forums policy</p><p>

4. Polling</p><p>

We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated.  Damntheradio may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question.</p><p>
