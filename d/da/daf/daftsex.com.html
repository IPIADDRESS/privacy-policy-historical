<h2>COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNICAL INFORMATION</h2>
<b>Cookies and Web beacons.</b> We, and our affiliates, third party service providers, and our business partners may send "cookies" to your computer or use similar technologies to enhance your online experience at our Sites. "Cookies" are files that can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical information. Cookies manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through us and/or other networks or sites. Cookies can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser).
Some of our Sites may use locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as "Flash cookies") to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation. Adobe's Flash player and similar applications use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. Flash cookies are not managed through your web browser, but you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe's web site.
We may also use "Web beacons" that monitor your use of our Sites. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a Web page for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the Web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the Web beacon appears, the time the page containing the Web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server.
When corresponding with you via HTML capable email, Web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our email.
On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if you choose to furnish personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies/Web beacons.
<br><br>
<b>Managing cookies and Web beacons.</b> By accepting this Privacy Policy, you specifically agree to our use of cookies and Web beacons as described herein. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other Web site. Additionally, by setting your Web browser to display HTML emails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some Web beacons. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. However, certain areas of our Sites can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content or Site features.
<h2>SECURITY</h2>
We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to safeguard the information we collect online at the Sites. Despite the reasonable security measure that we have created, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be used or disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
INFORMATION UPDATES AND/OR CORRECTIONS
To access the personally identifiable information that our Sites have collected about you online from the pages on which this Privacy Policy is posted, to correct factual errors in such information, or to update your interests, preferences or other portions of your user profile, please log into your account if you have created one with us or send an email to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="adccc9c0c4c3edd5c8dec1d483cec2c083"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="573438272e25382423322517303a363e3b7934383a">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>
To help protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
<h2>CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h2>
If you are a California resident, you have the right to receive: a) information identifying any third-party company to whom we may have disclosed, within the past calendar year, personal information pertaining to you and your family for our direct marketing purposes; and b) a description of the categories of personal information disclosed.

We will not honor such requests more than once per calendar year. Please email your request to <a><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bcdfd3ccc5ced3cfc8d9cefcdbd1ddd5d092dfd3d1">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>
<h2>CANADIAN PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
Our services may be subject to Canadian law, and in specific in relation to online privacy, to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (S.C. 2000, c. 5). If you believe that we have violated your privacy rights in any way, please contact us immediately at <a><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6e0d011e171c011d1a0b1c2e09030f0702400d0103">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> You may visit www.priv.gc.ca for more information about your privacy rights.

If the revised version includes a substantial change, we will provide you with Thirty (30) days’ notice prior to the effectiveness thereof by posting notice of the change in a prominent place on the Site, such as presenting to you a click-through page immediately following your account login.
