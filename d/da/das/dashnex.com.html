                <p>This statement governs our privacy policies with respect to those users of the Site ("Visitors") who
                    visit without transacting business and Visitors who register to transact business on the Site and
                    make use of the various services offered by Dashnex, LLC (collectively, "Services") ("Authorized
                    Customers").</p>

                <center><h2>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h2></center>

                <p>It refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the
                    person to whom such information pertains, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone
                    number, fax number, email address, financial profiles, social security number, and credit card
                    information. </p>

                <p>Personally Identifiable Information does not include information that is collected anonymously (that
                    is, without identification of the individual user) or demographic information not connected to an
                    identified individual.</p>

                <center><h2>WHAT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IS COLLECTED?</h2></center>

                <p>We may collect basic user profile information from all of our Visitors. We collect the following
                    additional information from our Authorized Customers: the names, addresses, phone numbers and email
                    addresses, the nature and size of the business, and the nature and size of the advertising inventory
                    that the Authorized Customer intends to purchase or sell.</p>

                <center><h2>WHAT ORGANIZATIONS ARE COLLECTING THE INFORMATION?</h2></center>

                <p>In addition to our direct collection of information, our third party service vendors (such as credit
                    card companies, clearinghouses and banks) who may provide such services as credit, insurance, and
                    escrow services may collect this information from our Visitors and Authorized Customers. </p>

                <p>We do not control how these third parties use such information, but we do ask them to disclose how
                    they use personal information provided to them from Visitors and Authorized Customers. </p>

                <p>Some of these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as links in the distribution chain,
                    and do not store, retain, or use the information given to them.</p>

                <center><h2>HOW DOES THE SITE USE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</h2></center>

                <p>We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to make appropriate service
                    offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling requests on the Site. </p>

                <p>We may email Visitors and Authorized Customers about research or purchase and selling opportunities
                    on the Site or information related to the subject matter of the Site. </p>

                <p>We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and Authorized Customers in
                    response to specific inquiries, or to provide requested information.</p>

                <center><h2>WITH WHOM MAY THE INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED?</h2></center>

                <p>Personally Identifiable Information about Authorized Customers may be shared with other Authorized
                    Customers who wish to evaluate potential transactions with other Authorized Customers. </p>

                <p>We may share aggregated information about our Visitors, including the demographics of our Visitors
                    and Authorized Customers, with our affiliated agencies and third party vendors. </p>

                <p>We also offer the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving information or being contacted by us or by
                    any agency acting on our behalf.</p>

                <center><h2>HOW IS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION STORED?</h2></center>

                <p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by Dashnex, LLC is securely stored and is not
                    accessible to third parties except for use as indicated above.</p>

                        INFORMATION?</h2></center>

                <p>Visitors and Authorized Customers may opt out of receiving unsolicited information from or being
                    contacted by us and/or our vendors and affiliated agencies by responding to emails as instructed, or
                    by contacting us via contact page on this website.</p>

                <center><h2>ARE COOKIES USED ON THE SITE?</h2></center>

                <p>Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain information about the preferences
                    of our Visitors and the services they select. We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect
                    our Authorized Customers. </p>

                <p>For example, if an Authorized Customer is logged on and the site is unused for more than 10 minutes,
                    we will automatically log the Authorized Customer off.</p>
