      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>
        <em>This Privacy Policy was last updated on May 24, 2018</em>
      </p>

      <h3>
        Our Policy:
      </h3>

      <p>
        Welcome to the web site (the “<strong>Site</strong>”) of Dasheroo. (“Dasheroo”, “we”, “us”
        and/or “our”). This Site is operated by Dasheroo and has been created to provide information
        about our company and our data analytics services, mobile applications and related services
        (together with the Site, the “<strong>Services</strong>”) to our Service visitors (“you”,
        “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Dasheroo’s policy with respect to information including
        personally identifiable data (“<strong>Personal Data</strong>”) and other information that
        is collected from visitors to the Site and Services.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Information We Collect:
      </h3>

      <p>
        When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other
        information from you, as further described below:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services:</strong>
        We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when
        you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the
        Services or use certain Services. Wherever Dasheroo collects Personal Data we make an effort
        to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in
        accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge
        and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices
        and servers of Dasheroo and the <a href="/about/data-subprocessors">authorized third parties</a>
        referred to herein located in the United States.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Other Information:</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Non-Identifiable Data:</strong>
        When you interact with Dasheroo through the Services, we receive and store certain personally
        non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various
        technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Dasheroo may store such
        information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by
        Dasheroo affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and
        pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our
        Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors'
        Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or
        used in this process.
      </p>

      <p>
        In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of
        information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access
        the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us
        analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your
        browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a
        password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we
        will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will
        find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to
        receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We
        recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some
        of the Service features.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Aggregated Personal Data:</strong>
        In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Dasheroo often
        conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal
        Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an
        aggregate basis, and Dasheroo may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and
        business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Dasheroo may
        also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and
        prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Google Analytics:</strong>
        We may allow third party service providers to use cookies or similar technologies to collect
        information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following
        your use of the Services. For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service
        provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how
        users use the Site and enhance your experience when you use the Service. For more information
        on how Google uses this data, go to
        <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.
      </p>


      <h3>
        Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:
      </h3>

      <p>
        Dasheroo uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy
        Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in
        connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email,
        we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem.
        Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your
        Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such
        services. Dasheroo and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use
        your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the
        Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand
        our users and to improve the Services. Dasheroo and its affiliates may use this information to
        contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If
        we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to
        "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not
        to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our
        mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.
      </p>

      <p>
        If Dasheroo intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this
        Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which
        the Personal Data is collected.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:
      </h3>

      <p>
        Dasheroo is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to
        be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in
        which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you,
        as set forth below:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy
        businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution
        or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Related Companies:</strong> We may also share your Personal Data with our Related
        Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong> Dasheroo, like many businesses,
        sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of
        such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments.
        When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with
        the information that they need to perform their specific function.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Dasheroo may disclose your Personal Data if required to
        do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a
        legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Dasheroo, (iii) act in
        urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public,
        or (iv) protect against legal liability.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Your Choices:
      </h3>

      <p>
        You can visit the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any
        Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain Services.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Exclusions:
      </h3>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Dasheroo other than
        Personal Data collected through the Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any
        unsolicited information you provide to Dasheroo through the Services or through any other
        means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the
        Services, such as forums, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products,
        and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”). All Unsolicited
        Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Dasheroo shall be free to reproduce,
        use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or
        attribution.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Children:
      </h3>

      <p>
        Dasheroo does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you
        are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We
        encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help
        enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on
        the Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the
        age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Dasheroo through the Services, please contact us,
        and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Links to Other Web Sites:
      </h3>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other web
        sites not operated or controlled by Dasheroo (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and
        procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services
        do not imply that Dasheroo endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest
        contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Integrating Third Party Services:

        One of the features of the Service is that it integrates information from various third party
        services like Facebook or Twitter (“Third Party Service(s)”). To take advantage of the
        Services, you will need to provide your login credentials for each Service that you connect
        to. When you add a Third Party Services account to the Service, we will collect relevant
        information necessary to enable the Service to access that Third Party Service and your data
        contained within that Third Party Service. As part of such integration, the Third Party
        Service will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to the
        Third Party Service, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with
        this Privacy Policy. However, please remember that the manner in which Third Party Services
        use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such third parties,
        and Dasheroo shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other
        actions of any Third Party Services that may be enabled within the Service.
      </p>
