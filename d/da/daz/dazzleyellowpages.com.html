This Privacy Policy is effective as of   										April 13, 2006. Our business changes   										constantly. This Privacy Policy will   										change also, and use of information that   										we gather now is subject to the Privacy   										Policy in effect at the time of use. We   										may e-mail periodic reminders of   										material changes to our Privacy Policy,   										unless you have instructed us not to,   										but you should check our web site   										frequently to see recent changes. Notice   										of any changes to this Privacy Policy   										shall be given by posting the version of   										the Privacy Policy containing such   										changes on this web site. <br>
<br>
<strong>What information does the Web site   										gather?</strong><br>
<br>
When you visit this site you may provide   										information on two different levels   										about your visit: <br>
<br>
<table id="table4" width="491" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="491" height="17" class="verdana">&nbsp;Anonymous   												statistics collected as you   												browse the site</td>

    <tr>
      <td height="17" class="verdana">&nbsp;Personal   												information you knowingly give   												us</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
Please be assured that we do not collect   										personal information about you from the   										website unless you provide it to us.   										This means that you can visit our Web   										sites without telling us who you are or   										revealing any personally identifiable   										information about yourself (such as your   										e-mail address). <br>
<br>
As you browse the site, our web servers   										collect information about your visit,   										not about you personally. Via web server   										logs, we monitor statistics such as: <br>
<br>
<table id="table5" width="491" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<br>
None of this information is associated   										with you as an individual (see   										information about cookies below). We use   										these statistics to improve our Web   										site, to monitor its performance, and to   										make the Web site easier for you and   										other visitors to use. <br>
<br>
<strong>What about pages that ask for   										personal information?</strong> <br>
When visitors supply information about   										themselves for a specific purpose, we   										use the information for that purpose   										(such as to provide the service or   										information the visitor has requested).   										For example, you may be asked to give us   										individual information to purchase a   										product or service, receive information,   										manage online account registration, or   										apply for a job. The information may   										range from your zip code, to your phone   										number, account number, a credit card   										number, age, gender, mother's maiden   										name, social security number, e-mail   										address, organization URL, resume, or   										mailing address.<br>
<br>
When visitors use our Web site to order   										services, we may use this personally   										identifiable information as we would use   										the same information obtained in a   										traditional non-electronic manner. For   										example, to publish your name, address,   										and phone number in our directories   										(unless you have requested a   										non-published number), or to evaluate   										your service needs and contact you   										regarding additional services you may   										find useful. If you do not want us to   										contact you, you can remove your name   										from our telephone or mail solicitation   										lists by clicking on <a href="http://www.dazzleyellowpages.com/Contact/">Contact Us</a>. Please note that this   										removes your name from   										dazzleyellowpages.com, however, to be   										removed from other websites in the Shyam   										InfoNet   										family of companies, contact   										them directly.<br>
<br>
Dazzle Yellow Pages does not knowingly collect   										information from children through this   										web site. This web site, and any web   										site to which users may link from this   										web site, may contain content provided   										by advertisers or other third parties   										that may not be suitable for children.   										Dazzle Yellow Pages asks parents or legal guardians   										to assist Dazzle Yellow Pages by supervising the   										activities of children at this web site. <br>
<br>
<strong>What happens to information when I   										fill out registration forms?</strong> <br>
The registration forms request accurate   										contact information (like name and   										e-mail address) and preferences that   										help us better serve you. Your name and   										e-mail address are used to send you   										information about our company, product   										updates, special offers, and   										newsletters. You may change your email,   										user ID or password online; or you can   										choose to remove your name from our user   										list by going to Contact Us and emailing   										us a request to remove your name. <br>
<br>
To improve the services we can offer   										you, we may decide to expand the site's   										capabilities for obtaining information   										about users in the future. We will   										update this privacy statement as   										policies change to ensure that you are   										aware of developments in this area. <br>
<br>
<strong>Do you sell or give my information to   										companies outside of the "Dazzle   										Yellow Pages   										Family?"</strong> <br>
We do not sell or disclose personally   										identifiable information obtained online   										about our visitors, to anyone outside of   										the "Dazzle Yellow Pages Family" unless you   										specifically authorize it, to complete a   										transaction that you initiated, it is   										required by law, or disclosure is   										necessary to protect the safety of   										customers, employees or property. If you   										provide personally identifiable   										information to us in the context of an   										event Dazzle Yellow Pages sponsors with another   										company, such as a contest, or if you   										register on a co-sponsored site or   										feature, you may also be providing the   										personally identifiable information to   										the co-sponsor. This will be made clear   										to you before you submit the information   										and you can decide whether or not to   										participate. <br>
<br>
Dazzle Yellow Pages may share non-personally   										identifiable information with non-"Dazzle   										Yellow Pages   										Family" companies in order to assess the   										results of a promotion, event or third   										party relationship, to provide   										information to current or prospective   										customers, to complete a search or to   										otherwise enhance your online   										experience. For example, we may provide   										statistical information that is not   										identified with you: <br>

<br>
<strong>Does this site send e-mail to site   										visitors?</strong> <br>
At times, online surveys are conducted   										in which you can choose to participate.   										In addition, we may use e-mail to   										communicate with our customers, to   										respond to visitors' e-mail, to confirm   										orders placed online, and to send   										information that a visitor has   										requested. Occasionally, we may use   										opt-in e-mail lists from third parties   										to promote our latest specials. If you   										receive an unwanted e-mail from us, you   										can click Contact Us and simply ask us   										to remove you from our list. <br>
<br>
<strong>Do you accommodate links to other   										sites?</strong> <br>
This website contains links to other web   										sites. These other web sites may, among   										other things, allow you to bid on and/or   										purchase products that you initially   										viewed on this web site. These other web   										sites may (or may not) be co-branded   										with Dazzle Yellow Pages or   										dazzleyellowpages.com.com branding. <strong>You can tell if you   										have linked from one web site to another   										web site by looking at the URL in the   										browser window. If the second level   										domain of the URL for the page   										containing the link is different than   										the second level domain of the URL for   										the page to which you have linked, you   										have linked to a different web site. For   										example, if you link from a page located   										at the URL <u> www.thirdleveldomain.dazzleyellowpages.com.com</u> to a page located at the URL <u> www.dazzleyellowpages.com.secondleveldomain.com</u>,   										you have linked to another site.

We are not responsible for the   										privacy policies or practices   										(including, without limitation, those   										related to tracking, collection, use and   										security) employed by (or in connection   										with) other sites, and we are not   										responsible for the content on, or   										operation of, other sites (including,   										without limitation, any transactions   										conducted through such other sites).

<br>
<strong>What is Dazzle Yellow Pages's position regarding   										online advertising and third party ad   										servers? </strong><br>
Dazzle Yellow Pages accepts advertisements from   										third parties that serve advertising   										into the dazzleyellowpages.com   										sites. Dazzle Yellow Pages may use "clear gifs"   										provided by such third parties in the   										pages containing the ad(s) that Dazzle   										Yellow Pages   										sends to your browser.

  <br>
  However, you need to understand that   										some websites/ad serving companies have   										the ability to reestablish your history   										even after cookie deletion, if you   										reenter the same site on another   										occasion, or some other site tracked by   										the ad serving company/network, and   										specifically provide personal data. <br>
  <br>
  Deletion of cookies alone does not   										prevent ad serving companies from   										reestablishing history on a visitor. The   										visitor must either continue to decline   										cookies each time it reenters the site   										to keep the tracking severed, if   										desired, or opt-out.

  There are a variety of security measures   										in place that limits internal access to   										data stored by the Dazzle Yellow Pages site. Access   										is restricted to authorized personnel   										only and requires an employee to have a   										secure ID and password to access the   										information. In addition, logs are   										reviewed regularly to spot any   										inconsistencies. The site is continually   										updated with the latest known security   										patches that are periodically published   										by the system vendor. Any information   										that you give is password protected. For   										your protection, the system   										automatically locks out a user after 3   										incorrect tries and after 20 minutes of   										idle time per secure session. If you   										forget your password, you will be   										prompted to supply your customer ID   										number and your password will be   										e-mailed to you. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>What information is stored by the   										site or in cookies?</strong> <br>
  Registration information, bill and   										online shopping, data and contact e-mail   										addresses are stored in Dazzle Yellow   										Pages   										databases which are physically secure   										environments that are not accessible via   										the Internet. This information is only   										available to you through the use of a   										secure ID and password, and the   										information is transferred from our   										databases for your viewing. <br>
