		<p>Introduction</p>

		<p>David Yurman operates www.DavidYurman.com, (“Web Site”).  Pursuant to an agreement with David Yurman, The Neiman Marcus Group, Inc. (“Neiman Marcus”) provides customer service and product fulfillment for the Web Site.  Both Neiman Marcus and David Yurman ("we" or "us”) recognize that you care how information about you is used and shared. We have created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to inform you of our information collection, use and sharing practices for this Web Site. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at this Web Site, and does not cover any information collected offline by David Yurman or Neiman Marcus (unless specifically stated). </p>

		<p>Security</p> 
		Personal information provided on the Web Site and online credit card transactions are transmitted through a secure server using Secure Socket Layering (SSL), encryption technology. When the letters "http" in the URL change to "https," the "s" indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL; also, your browser may give you a pop-up message that you're about to enter a secure area.<p></p> 

		<p>You may purchase online merchandise by calling toll-free 1.877.908.1177 -- 24 hours a day, seven days a week. One of our customer service associates will gladly take your order.</p> 

		<p>We are committed to handling your personal information with high standards of information security. We take appropriate physical, electronic and administrative steps to maintain the security and accuracy of personally identifiable information we collect, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as employing electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized access. Our website uses encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL encrypts ordering information such as your name, address and credit card number. Our customer service center and stores also operate over a private, secure network.

		<p>We have posted this Privacy Policy in order to explain our information collection practices and the choices you have about the way information is collected and used.</p> 

		<p>As we continue to develop our Web Site and take advantage of advances in technology to improve the services we offer, this Privacy Policy likely will change. We therefore encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current Privacy Policy.</p>

		<p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on September 4, 2007.</p>

		<li>to notify you of product recalls or provide other information concerning products you have purchased</li>  
		<li>to improve our merchandise selections, customer service, and overall shopping experience</li>  
		</ul>

We require that these outside companies agree to keep confidential all information we share with them and to use the information only to perform their obligations in the agreements. </p>

		<p>Other companies: We may provide information to carefully selected outside companies when we believe their products or services may be of interest to you.</p>

You will be notified via e-mail or prominent notice on our Web Site prior to a change of ownership or control of your personal information, if your personal information will be used contrary to this policy.

		<p>Cookies and how we use them</p> 
		<p>Cookies: A "cookie" is a small data file stored by your Web browser on your computer's hard drive. It allows us to recognize your computer (but not specifically who is using it) upon entering our site by associating the identification numbers in the cookie with other customer information you have provided us. That customer information is stored on our secured database.</p> 

		<p>We use cookies to keep track of what you have in your shopping cart and to remember you when you return to the Web Site as well as to identify the pages you click on during your visit to our site and the name of the Web Site you visited immediately before clicking to the Web Site. We use this information to improve our site design, product assortments, customer service, and special promotions. You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of our Web Site will not operate correctly if you disable cookies.</p> 

		<p>We may contract with third parties who may use cookies and collect information on our behalf or provide services such as credit card processing, shipping, promotional services or data management. We call them our Customer Care Partners. These third parties are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our other Customer Care Partners. However, we respect your right to choose whether to be included in such services.</p>

Our online sweepstakes are restricted to entrants who are at least 18 years old.</p>
