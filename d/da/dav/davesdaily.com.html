        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We respect your
            privacy, and we want you to feel comfortable using our website. Therefore,
            we are providing you with this privacy policy
          so you can better understand how we collect information about you,
          what we do with your information, and who, other than CyberClicks,
            Inc., may also receive your information.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><u>Collection of Customer Information</u></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to
            provide you with the highest level of service, we ask that you voluntarily
            provide us with certain information about
          yourself (collectively, your "Customer Information"). Your
          Customer Information may include your first and last name, your email
          address, street address, city and your zip code. We also ask you to
          voluntarily provide us with the email addresses of your friends on
          our mailing list page, so they too can benefit from the various products
          and services offered by CyberClicks, Inc..</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><u>Use of Customer Information</u></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once we obtain
            your Customer Information, it is added to a list of other information
            we have obtained from other CyberClicks, Inc.
          customers and patrons (the "Customer List").</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On occasion, we may hire third parties to perform certain
          functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering
          packages, removing repetitive information from the Customer List, analyzing
          data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments,
          and providing customer service. These third parties have access to
          your Customer Information to the extent necessary to permit them to
          do their jobs, however, they may not use it for other purposes.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As CyberClicks, Inc. continues to grow and develop, we might
          sell assets to, or buy assets from, third parties. In such transactions,
          Customer Information may be one of the transferred business assets.
          Also, in the unlikely event that CyberClicks, Inc., or substantially all
          of CyberClicks, Inc.' assets are acquired, Customer Information will be
          one of the transferred assets.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also may disclose your Customer Information if we
          are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such
          action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process;
          (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against
          misuse or unauthorized use of our website; or (4) protect the personal
          safety or property of our users or the public (among other things,
          this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose
          as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of
          any investigation into your actions). </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, we may use the information we obtain from
          our customers in the aggregate to determine our customers' demographics
          and preferences. By doing so, we are able to deliver targeted advertisements
          on our website which you may find to be helpful and informative.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You
            will be provided with an opportunity to receive information from
            various
            companies that advertise on our website (collectively, "Third
          Party Companies" or, individually, a "Third Party Company").
          In order to receive or not to receive information from Third Party
          Companies, you must check or uncheck the box next to the advertiser
          from whom you wish to receive or not receive additional information
          from. By checking the box, your Customer information will be sent to
          that
          Third Party Company, and you will receive correspondence directly from
          that Third Party Company. By not or unchecking the box, your Customer
          information will not be sent to that Third Party Company. CyberClicks,
          Inc. does not warrant or guaranty the statements, products or services
          provided
          by any of the Third Party Companies. Each Third Party Company may have
          privacy policies that differ significantly from ours, and so you should
          carefully review the privacy policy of any Third Party Company before
          providing that company with any additional information about yourself.</font></p>
