<h2>Information and Privacy Statement</h2>

<p><b>Web Hosting Logs</b>. As with most servers on the Internet, our servers automatically 
log visitor Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which are used to help diagnose problems 
with servers and administer Web sites. These addresses are also used to gather broad demographic 
information, such as geographic regions and popular Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for 
the purpose of creating content and information that appeals to our customers.</p>

<p><b>Links to other Websites</b>. This site may contain links to other sites. DavyJones.net 
is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.</p>

<p><b>PayPal Shopping Cart</b>. We utilize the PayPal shopping cart, which resides 
at the PayPal website, for products sold from our online store. Establishing a PayPal account 
is not required to purchase, and PayPal accounts are initiated and maintained by PayPal 
members at the PayPal website, and are not subject to our access or control. When a customer 
places an order through our PayPal shopping cart, we receive notice of the purchase by 
email from PayPal containing the following personally identifying information which we 
use to communicate with and ship merchandise to customers:</p>

<ul>

<li>Name</li>
<li>Street Address, City, State, Zip Code, Country</li>
<li>Email address</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>This information is not stored on our website, and thus we provide no method of updating 
customers' personal and identifying information on our website. We do, however, maintain 
the confidentiality of this information to the best of our ability, and do not sell, share, 
or trade this information with any third parties in any way.</p>
