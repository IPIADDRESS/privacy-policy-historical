<p><b>Web Hosting Logs</b>. As with most servers on the Internet, our servers automatically 
log visitor Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which are used to help diagnose problems 
with servers and administer Web sites. These addresses are also used to gather broad demographic 
information, such as geographic regions and popular Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for 
the purpose of creating content and information that appeals to our customers.</p>
