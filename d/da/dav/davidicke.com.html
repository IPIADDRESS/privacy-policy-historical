<p>We will only use information collected about you in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
<p>We will hold your personal data on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity.</p>
<p>We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent.</p>

We give you a choice of whether or not you want us or other reputable companies to contact you about future events and new services or related activities that you may find useful. We will not sell or trade personal information to other companies but we would like to keep you informed of the developments on all sites and we would like to share data with other reputable companies who may have interesting offers and information for you (inside or outside the EU).</p>
<p>We will not send you any marketing emails or pass your information on to third parties unless you give your consent or you have given it already.</p>
<p>Cookies<br>

If you do not wish for us to use cookies when you use all sites please adjust your Internet browser settings to not accept cookies. Your computer’s help file should tell you how to do this but please note that this may affect your ability to use all sites.</p>
<p>Since May 2011, the laws in the EU in respect of how website operators use cookies (and similar tools) has been updated by way of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2011. The legislation requires website operators to acquire the pre-informed consent of visitors to a website before all non-essential cookies (and similar tools) are installed on the user’s hard drives.

Describing himself as the most controversial speaker and author in the world, he has written many books explaining his position, dubbed "New Age conspiracism", and has attracted a substantial following across the political spectrum. His 533-page The Biggest Secret (1999) has been called the conspiracy theorist's Rosetta Stone. <strong><a class="read-more" title="Read more about David Icke" href="http://www.davidicke.com/about-david/">READ MORE...</a></strong></p></div>
