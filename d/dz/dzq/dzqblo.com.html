    <br>

    <br>
    <strong>Children’s Privacy</strong>
<br>
<br>


    Diablo does not solicit or knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If Diablo obtains actual knowledge that
    it has collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, Diablo will immediately delete such information from its database.
    Because Diablo does not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, Diablo has no such information to use or disclose to
    third parties. Diablo has designed this Privacy Policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
<br>

    <br>
    <strong>Information Collection</strong>
    <br>
<br>
    (a) Traffic Data. Like most website operators, Diablo automatically gathers information of the sort that browsers automatically make available, including:
    (i) IP addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers accessing the Website; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Website (collectively
    “Traffic Data”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you.

<br>
    (b) Ad Serving. Diablo uses third-parties for advertising and analytics for pages that we host. These third-parties may place Cookies on your machine, use
    web beacons, gather IP addresses and log data to collect traffic and activity data to send to the United States in order to deliver relevant metrics,
    content, and advertising.

<br>
    (c) Advertiser and Publisher Application Information. To enroll in our Services, you are required to become an advertiser or publisher to receive
    appropriate information. You will be asked to provide Diablo certain information that personally identifies you and/or your company (“Personal
    Information”). Personal Information includes, without limitation: (1) “Contact Data” (such as your name, phone number, fax number, mailing address e-mail
    address, and website URLs) and (2) “Financial Data” (such as your credit/debit card number and expiration date). In each case, you will be asked to provide
    information; the Website will not gather it surreptitiously. The information revealed in an application is stored safely on the company’s information
    databases and is never accessed by unauthorized third parties. Diablo may supplement the information you provide with additional Personal Information
    gathered from public sources or from third-parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies) who may lawfully provide such information to Diablo. An application
    must be completed in full in order to be accepted. Applicants who do not meet specific criteria will not be approved or admitted into the affiliate
    network. If you do not wish to submit your personal information, please do not complete or send an application. You are under no obligation to provide your
    information, with the caveat that your refusal to do so may prevent you from using certain of the Services. Applying as either advertiser or publisher does
    not guarantee approval and is subject to review.
<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Information Disclosure</strong>
<br>
    <br>
    We make all efforts to effectively store, protect and preserve your privacy and personal information. Except under the following circumstances, Diablo will

    experience. Diablo also discloses Personal Information to those who help it provide services, including without limitation those who perform technical,
    administrative, and data processing tasks such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, and data storage and security.
<br>
    (b) By Law or to Protect Rights. Diablo discloses Personal Information when required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena or court order, or when
    Diablo believes in its sole discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Diablo, third parties or the public at
    large.
<br>
    (c) Business Transfers; Bankruptcy. Diablo reserves the right to transfer all Personal Information in its possession to a successor organization in the
    event of a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of Diablo’s assets. Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or
    other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred Personal Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if you are
    given notice of that new privacy policy and an opportunity to affirmatively opt-out of it. Personal Information submitted or collected after a transfer,
    however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by Diablo’s successor organization.
<br>
    (d) Unpaid Accounts. If you fail to pay any balance owed in consideration of services, Ddiablo may, as permitted by law, report your Personal Information,
    including without limitation your unpaid balance, to consumer credit reporting services, collection agencies and others.
