                    <p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND WHEN?</strong><br>
                      <br>
                          <u>Personally Identifiable  Information</u><br>
                          <em>When  you register</em> with the Site we collect your name, email address, telephone  number, and additional contact information.&nbsp;  We also collect a website username and password.</p>
                    <p><em>When  you make purchases at the online store on the Site</em> we collect your credit  card information, billing and shipping addresses, and other  transaction-specific information, such as the kinds and quantities of products  that you have purchased.&nbsp; We may in the  future collect information regarding your health insurance coverage in order to  assist you and other of our customers in obtaining reimbursement from health  insurers for the purchase of Dexcom products.</p>
                    <p><em>When  you send email</em> through the Site, we collect your screen name and email  address, as well as any additional information you include in the message.</p>
                    <p><em>When  you’re navigating the Site</em> we record your IP address.</p>
                    <p>We consider each of the above  pieces of information to be “Personally Identifiable Information” because it is  individually identifiable information about you.</p>
                    <u>Other Information Associable with You<br>
                    </u><em>When  you’re navigating the Site</em> we log various information to help manage and  improve our Site, to provide additional services, and for sales and marketing,  in general and for you in particular. For example, we identify items such as  domains and browser types to understand how our Site is used and to report  these statistics in the aggregate to the vendors that manage the technology of  our website. We also record any information you enter, such as search terms. <strong></strong>
                    <p><u>Cookies,  etc.&nbsp; </u><br>
  Like many websites, we use  “cookies,” 1-pixel gifs (spotlight tags), JavaScript code, and other standard  web technology to collect information for our own use.&nbsp; A “cookie” is a small data file that we  transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.&nbsp; You can instruct your browser, by editing  its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a  cookie and to permit you to refuse it.&nbsp;  In most cases you can refuse a cookie and still navigate our Site,  though it may disable some features. Check with the maker of your browser for more  information about how to control cookies.</p>
                    <p>Cookies make it easier for you to  register with and use the Site and for us to offer opt-in and opt-out  opportunities, and they enable us to follow your navigation through the Site  and customize it to your interests.&nbsp;  Cookies allow us to remember your identity and preferences so we can  display content appropriate for you and your interests.</p>
                    <p><strong>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE  INFORMATION?</strong></p>
                    <p>                      We use your personally identifiable  information (and at times other information we collect) to: </p>
                    <ul type="disc">
