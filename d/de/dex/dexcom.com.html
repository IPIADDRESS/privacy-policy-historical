<p>Last Updated: September, 2008</p> 

<h2>Introduction</h2> 

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that visitors transmit to DexCom through the DexCom website located at <a href="http://www.dexcom.com" target="_blank">www.dexcom.com</a>(the Site). DexCom is committed to your privacy. This Privacy Policy is designed to inform you of what information we collect from you on this Site and how we and our affiliates handle that information. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using, or submitting information, to this Site.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains the Site's processing and storage practices in the United States for personal information transmitted through the Site. Visitors subject to the jurisdiction of other countries must not submit information through this Site, and by doing so waive any and all liability DexCom may have to them in connection with such information. By browsing the Site and communicating electronically with us, Site visitors acknowledge that we are processing and storing their personal information in the United States under U.S. privacy standards. Use of this Site constitutes your consent to application of such laws and regulations and to our Privacy Policy.</p> 

<p><strong>By using this Site, you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Whenever you submit information via this Site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</strong></p> 

<h2>Privacy Practices Specific to Personal Health Information</h2>

<p>Please note that DexCom will handle any personal health information which you provide to it, through the Site or otherwise, in accordance the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, a federal privacy law commonly referred to as "HIPAA" or the "HIPAA Privacy Rules." For more information on how DexCom handles your personal health information, please refer to our <a href="/notice_of_privacy_practices">Notice of HIPAA Privacy Practices</a>.</p>

<h2>What Information Do We Collect and When?</h2>

<p><span class="ul">Personally Identifiable Information</span><br><em>When you register with the Site</em> we collect your name, email address, telephone number, and additional contact information. We also collect a website username and password.</p>

<p><em>When you make purchases at the online store on the Site</em> we collect your credit card information, billing and shipping addresses, and other transaction-specific information, such as the kinds and quantities of products that you have purchased. We may in the future collect information regarding your health insurance coverage in order to assist you and other of our customers in obtaining reimbursement from health insurers for the purchase of DexCom products.</p> 

<p><em>When you send email through the Site</em>, we collect your screen name and email address, as well as any additional information you include in the message.</p> 

<p><em>When you're navigating the Site</em> we record your IP address.</p> 

<p>We consider each of the above pieces of information to be "Personally Identifiable Information" because it is individually identifiable information about you.</p>

<h2>Other Information Associable with You</h2>

<p><em>When you're navigating the Site</em> we log various information to help manage and improve our Site, to provide additional services, and for sales and marketing, in general and for you in particular. For example, we identify items such as domains and browser types to understand how our Site is used and to report these statistics in the aggregate to the vendors that manage the technology of our website. We also record any information you enter, such as search terms.</p>

<p><span class="ul">Cookies, etc.</span><br>Like many websites, we use "cookies," 1-pixel gifs (spotlight tags), JavaScript™ code, and other standard web technology to collect information for our own use. A "cookie" is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie and to permit you to refuse it. In most cases you can refuse a cookie and still navigate our Site, though it may disable some features. Check with the maker of your browser for more information about how to control cookies.</p>

<p>Cookies make it easier for you to register with and use the Site, and for us to offer opt-in and opt-out opportunities, and they enable us to follow your navigation through the Site and customize it to your interests. Cookies allow us to remember your identity and preferences so we can display content appropriate for you and your interests.</p>

<h2>How Do We Use Your Personally Identifiable Information?</h2> 

<p class="last">We use your personally identifiable information (and at times other information we collect) to:</p>

<ul class="first"> 
<li>authenticate your visits to the Site;</li> 
<li>fulfill orders that you place through the online store on the Site;</li> 
<li>send you important information regarding products you have purchased and/or use;</li> 
<li>help us respond to email inquiries and questions to our call center;</li> 
<li>help us better market and provide our products and services and the products and services of our affiliates.</li> 
</ul>

<p>We also use the information to manage and improve our Site content and notify you about changes or improvements to our Site.</p>

<p>Unless you have opted-out of receiving marketing information, such as email updates regarding new products, we may use your personal information to customize and deliver that information to you. However, we will not sell your personally identifiable information to any outside company for marketing or solicitation.</p>

<p>We may also enhance or merge personal information collected through the Site with data we collect from through other channels or receive from third parties in order to better market our products and services and serve your needs.</p>

<h2>Limited Disclosure of Your Personal Information to Third Parties</h2> 
 
<p class="last">We do share non-public, personally identifiable information with our affiliates. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties, but only as follows:</p>

<ul class="first">
<li>to vendors that help us fulfill orders for our products and/or deliver product information, publications, or other reference materials</li> 
<li>to advertising and marketing agencies to help sell and market our own products and services</li> 
<li>to technology and other service providers to provide technology and services to us</li> 
</ul>

<p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that the above unaffiliated third parties keep your information confidential and do not use the information for any purpose other than providing services to us and to you under our direction.</p>

<p>We also disclose such information as permitted or required by law or as required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process.</p> 

<p>As our business evolves, we may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including information provided by you, in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of some or all of our assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. In any such event, personally identifiable and other information may be one of the assets transferred.</p>

<h2>Choice</h2>

<p><span class="ul">Choosing NOT to disclose personal information</span><br>You are not required to register in order to gain access to many areas of the Site. However, in order to use certain of the Site's services, we require registration with a username and password for authentication and for secure access to the online store on the Site.</p>

<p><span class="ul">Opting Out</span><br>You can "opt-out" during the registration process (which means you do not permit us to use non-public, personally identifiable information we collect on the Site to send you separate online marketing and advertising materials) by so indicating when you register on the Site or by updating your Profile as described below. You may opt-out at any time by contacting us using the information appearing below under "Contact Us."</p>

<p><span class="ul">Reviewing your information and requesting changes to your Profile</span><br>You should identify and correct any inaccuracies in the information you submit. To update information previously submitted, please sign in and click on the "Profile" link located at the top the web page relating to the online store on the Site. Please direct inquiries about the accuracy of information previously submitted through the Site, or requests to update information, to DexCom using the contact information appearing below under "Contact Us." DexCom will not be responsible for outdated information or for verifying personal information.</p> 

<h2>More on Privacy</h2>

<p><span class="ul">Children's online privacy protection</span><br>DexCom understands the importance of protecting children's privacy, especially in an online environment. The Site is not designed for or directed at children. It is our policy not to knowingly collect or maintain information about anyone under the age of 18.</p>

<p><span class="ul">Links to third-party sites</span><br>The Site may contain links to third-party websites. We assume no responsibility for the information practices of those websites. We encourage visitors to review each third-party website's Privacy Policy before disclosing any personal information on that website.</p>

<p><span class="ul">Phishing</span><br>We do not and will not, at any time, request personal information in a non-secure or unsolicited email or telephone communication. Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to us. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is our priority. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission.</p>

<p><span class="ul">Security</span><br>The Site uses generally accepted standards of technology and operational security to protect personal information. Personal information transmitted to the Site is received in encrypted form.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time as our services change and grow. We will indicate any such changes at the privacy link at the bottom of our home page, and your continued use of the Site will signify your acknowledgement of any new terms.
