Dex Media collects and may store and share personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide to us. For example, Dex Media may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information (such as name, address, e-mail address and telephone number). Dex Media will not share credit card information or social security numbers. If you purchase a product or service, Dex Media may ask you to provide additional information such as your credit card information. In some cases (for example, if you register with us or sign-in on This Website or purchase a product or service) Dex Media may also ask you to provide other information such as a personal ID, password, security question and answer, and birthday.</p><p>If you choose to use an available referral service on This Website (e.g., to send a postcard, listing, page link, contest invitation, etc.), we may ask for certain personal information from the recipient (e.g., the recipient’s name, address, e-mail address, mobile telephone number) and your name and e-mail address. Dex Media uses the personally identifiable referral information you provide to facilitate this communication and may also store and use such personally identifiable information for analysis and business development purposes provided by Dex Media or its third party vendors. You are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide.</p><p><u>Personally and Nonpersonally Information Automatically Collected</u>. In addition, as you (and other users) browse This Website, our web servers, and its third party vendors also known as non “Dex Media Family” companies with which Dex Media has an agreement may, automatically collect, track, store and share certain information about such visits, usually through the use of browser <a href="#cookies"><b>cookies</b></a>, JavaScript files and tagging, web address tracking codes, file impression counts, “web beacons”, and the analysis of http headers (“Tracking Methods”). These Tracking Methods provide information such the users personally identifiable information, the user’s IP address, the user’s domain name, the user’s browser type, the user’s user agent, how many users visit This Website, which pages the user visits and for how long, the date and time the user accesses This Website, the Internet address of the site from which the user directly linked to This Website and the links on This Website on which the user clicks. In addition, Dex Media may collect certain search parameters relating to searches conducted by the user which are not entered by the user.</p><p>Dex Media may also collect, store and share information, including personally identifiable information, related to your usage of third-party sites that you access through the Websites.</p><p><u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide</u>. In some cases, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information that you provide, such as search parameters in connection with a search you conduct through This Website, ratings and reviews, and zip code.</p><p>To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand This Website’s capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future. We will update this Privacy Policy as our practices change to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.</p><p><strong>How does Dex Media use, store and share information collected on This Website?</strong></p><p><u>Specific Purpose</u>. When users supply personally identifiable information about themselves for a specific purpose (for example, to register to use a feature on This Website, to purchase a product or service, to obtain a free listing, to register for a program or to use a feature of a program, to receive information, or to apply for a job), we may use, store, and/or share such information for such purpose as well as to analyze and improve services provided by Dex Media.</p><p><u>Similar to Information Collected in Traditional Non-Electronic Manner</u>. We also may use, store and/or share personally identifiable information users provide as we would use, store and/or share the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner. For example, we may use such personally identifiable information to assess your credit rating.
