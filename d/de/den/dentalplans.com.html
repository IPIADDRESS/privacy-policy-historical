<p><font size="2">DentalPlans.com takes your privacy seriously. Please read the 
following to learn more about our privacy policy.<br>
<br>
<font color="#000080"><b>What This Privacy Policy Covers</b></font><br>
<br>
This policy covers how DentalPlans.com treats personal information that 
DentalPlans.com collects and receives, including information related to your 
past use of DentalPlans.com products and services. Personal information is 
information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, 
email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
</font></p>
<p><font size="2">This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that 
DentalPlans.com does not own or control, or to people that DentalPlans.com does 
not employ or manage.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font color="#000080"><b>Information Collection and Use </b>
</font><br>
<br>

partners or other companies. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">When you register we ask for information such as your name, 
email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal 
interests. For some financial products and services we may also ask for your 
address, Social Security number, and information about your assets. Once you 
register with DentalPlans.com and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous 
to us. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">DentalPlans.com collects information about your transactions 
with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your 
use of financial products and services that we offer. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">DentalPlans.com automatically receives and records information 
on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, DentalPlans.com 
cookie information, and the page you request. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">DentalPlans.com uses information for the following general 
purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your 
requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct 
research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.
</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font color="#000080"><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure<br>
</b></font><br>
DentalPlans.com does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you 
with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or 
services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following 
circumstances: </font></p>
<p><font size="2">We provide the information to trusted partners who work on 
behalf of or with DentalPlans.com under confidentiality agreements. These 
companies may use your personal information to help DentalPlans.com communicate 
with you about offers from DentalPlans.com and our marketing partners. However, 
these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
</font></p>
<p><font size="2">We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or 
exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; We believe it is 
necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action 
regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential 
threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of DentalPlans.com's 
terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">We transfer information about you if DentalPlans.com is 
acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, DentalPlans.com will 
notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a 
different privacy policy. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><br>
DentalPlans.com displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. 
Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact

you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing 
an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the 
assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. <br>
