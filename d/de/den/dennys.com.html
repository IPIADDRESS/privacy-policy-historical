		<td><br><div align="left"><b>Your Privacy</b><br>At Denny's, we are committed to protecting your privacy.&nbsp; While visiting the Denny’s site you may be asked to provide information that personally identifies you (name, address, billing address, email address, home telephone number, mobile telephone number, credit card number and social security number). &nbsp;The following are sample areas in the Denny’s site where we request personal information:</div>
<div align="left">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Job Inquires with Denny’s, Inc.</div>
<div align="left">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Franchise Inquiry</div>
<div align="left">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gift Certificate Purchase</div>

<div align="left">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Request Information about Denny’s</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">The information that we collect is on a voluntary basis.&nbsp; You may choose not to provide personal information and you still will be able to visit most of the Denny’s site.&nbsp; However, you will not be able to complete the activities listed above using the web site without providing us the required personally identifiable information.&nbsp; Please read on for more detail about our privacy policy.<br><br></div>
<div align="left"><b>What information do we collect? How do we use it?</b><br>The personal information that we collect varies depending on the activity you wish to conduct on the web.&nbsp; We will need more information for job inquiries, franchise inquiries, gift certificate purchase, contest entry and real estate site submission than we require for customer feedback, information request and e-mail subscriptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. If you have not opted out of receiving marketing materials, we may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the website, new Denny's services and special offers we think you'll find valuable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></div>
<div align="left">You can choose not to allow us to use your personal information for direct marketing purposes by indicating your preference at the time of collection or by responding to the promotional e-mail in the manner provided.&nbsp; In certain circumstances, consent may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, when we want to use information for a purpose not previously identified).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></div>
<div align="left"><b>Will Denny's disclose the information it collects to outside parties?</b><br>Presently, Denny's does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. Denny's may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.<br><br></div>
<div align="left">If you submit comments through the web site, we may use or post your comments (or a portion or variation of your comments), along with your first name, city or town on this web site or other media without payment or compensation to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></div>
<div align="left">In instances when we receive customer complaints or feedback concerning specific franchised restaurants, we will forward the feedback to the franchised restaurant owner.<br><br></div>
<div align="left">Other instances in which we may need to disclose personal information include:</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when required by law to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us;</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to enforce our policies or agreements including the collection of amounts owed to us;</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to protect users of our site(s) and our site(s) from fraudulent or abusive use.</div>
