The term "service", or "services" refers to the dennisbabkin.com website and any services it may provide in general.</p>

<p>Should you have any questions or concerns regarding the use of the service, please consider contacting us at <a href="https://dennisbabkin.com/contact">dennisbabkin.com/contact</a> first. By continuing to use our website you are implicitly agreeing to the terms of this document.</p>


<h2>What information do we collect?</h2>

<ul>

<li>When you visit our website we may collect the following information about your visit: your IP address, date and time of your visit, the web browser you are using, referrer link that you came from.

<li>If you provide any user feedback (including but not limited to, bug reports about the use of our software) the information provided in your feedback will be stored on our servers. We may use such information to diagnose software bugs and to improve our service in the future. In the event that you prefer us to delete your provided information in the feedback, please indicate so in your request.</li>

</ul>


<h2>How do we protect your information?</h2>

<p>Information stored on our servers is not intended to leave said servers, or to be shared with any third parties. Unless specifically required by law and is inquired by the law enforcement agencies, such stored information will be kept on our servers only. We will exercise all available precautions to keep such information safe. Although note that we are not obligated to safeguard collected information.</p>



<h2>Do we use cookies?</h2>

<h2>Do we use third-party links and affiliate programs?</h2>

<p>Our service uses Google Analytics to track visits to our website. Such tracking is not associated with individuals and is done in general sense. The tracking is not present in the software that you can download from our website.</p>


<h2>Do we display ads?</h2>

<p>No. This service does not display ads. We may provide license-based software that may require a purchase to use. But neither this website, nor any of our software (including the free one) displays ads or does any user tracking (unless such is expressly indicated in the specific software EULA.)</p>

<p>Moreover, if you encounter an ad displayed on our website (or in any of our services, including our software) keep in mind that such material was not furnished by us, and was most certainly injected into our product by your current ISP, web browser, web browser add-on or extension, antivirus product or malware present on your system. If you suspect that such is the case, please notify us by going to <a href="https://dennisbabkin.com/contact">dennisbabkin.com/contact</a> page. Such behavior is against our privacy policy!</p>



<h2>What information do we store on our servers?</h2>

<h2>What if I want to remove the service completely?</h2>

<p>We will not be able to remove tracking information about your past visits to our service. If you wish not to provide such information in the future, please consider not visiting our website or using our software.</p>

<p>In case you are intending to remove our software, please review said software documentation. Most software products can be fully removed directly from the Windows Control Panel. Other, simpler software, does not require uninstallation and can be removed simply by closing said software and by removing its executable file from the disk. In either case pressing F1 key while the software is running should bring up its manual that will contain information on how to remove it. Additionally, <a href="https://dennisbabkin.com/software">FAQ pages</a> for each software product will contain additional details on how to remove it. All of our software products support full removal from user systems. In case you run into issues while removing our software, make sure to <a href="https://dennisbabkin.com/contact">contact our support team</a> for assistance.</p>
