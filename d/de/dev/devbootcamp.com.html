<p>Bootcamp Education, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”), knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting the Company’s website at www.devbootcamp.com or any of Company’s other websites, applications, domain names or other linked pages, (collectively the “Website”), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. By using the Website, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States. You post any Content (as that term is defined in the Company’s Terms of Service located at <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/legal/terms-of-service">http://devbootcamp.com/legal/terms-of-service</a> ) on the Website at your own risk. Although we may allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that Content you post on the Website will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your Content.</p>
<p>Any improper collection or misuse of Content or other information accessible on the Website is a violation of the Company’s Terms of Service and should be reported to hello@devbootcamp.com.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-this-privacy-policy-cover">WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Company collects and uses information from its users who access the Website and use our services, including Company’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”). Also, this Privacy Policy covers Company’s treatment of any Personal Information that Company’s business partners share with Company, or that you provide to the Company through a third party website using a Company application. This policy does not apply to websites or practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-students-personal-information-treated">HOW IS STUDENTS’ PERSONAL INFORMATION TREATED?</h2>
<p>If you are a minor (under the age of 18), you may only use this service and disclose Personal Information with your parent or guardian’s express consent. Company collects limited Personal Information from students (“Students’s Personal Information”), but only where that student’s school, district, and/or teacher has contracted with Company to collect Students’s Personal Information from students for the use and benefit of the learning environment. Company requires schools, districts, and/or teachers to obtain parental consent from students’ parents before collecting any such Students’s Personal Information. If you are a student, please do not send any Students’s Personal Information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you sign up for the Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected Students’s Personal Information from a student without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student has provided us Students’s Personal Information beyond what we request when he or she signs up for the Services, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student may have provided us Students’s Personal Information beyond what is requested when signing up for the Services, or that a student’s school, district, or teacher has not obtained parental consent, please contact us at hello@devbootcamp.com. Hereinafter, references to “Personal Information” shall apply to personal information of individual Website users who are not student registrants. References to “Students’s Personal Information” shall only apply to personal information of student users of the Website. General references to “information” shall apply to all users.</p>
<h2 id="what-information-does-company-display-or-collect">WHAT INFORMATION DOES COMPANY DISPLAY OR COLLECT?</h2>
<p>When you use the Website, you may set up your personal profile, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels, depending on the category of user (“User Category”) you are, and as permitted by the functionality of the Website. The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and, in some cases, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile through the Website. In most cases, we retain such information so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information. In addition to the foregoing, we collect the following types of information from our users.</p>
<h3 id="information-you-provide-to-us">Information You Provide to Us:</h3>

We also record the details of your activity on the Website. This information is not Personal Information or Students’s Personal Information.
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site.
