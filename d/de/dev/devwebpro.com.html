            iEntry, Inc. Privacy Policy</span><br>
            iEntry reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying 
            users through a notice posted on iEntry.com or by email, of the existence 
            of a new privacy policy or any updates.
            <p><span class="contentTextB">Registration</span><br>
iEntry collects personally identifying information only during the registration 
process. Information is collected in certain portions of iEntry in which users 
specifically and knowingly provide such information along with content submissions, 
jayde.com submissions or suggestions. iEntry may use such information for its 
internal purposes, including, but not limited to, editorial and feedback purposes. 
</p>
            <p>Information submitted at the time of registration (including newsletter 
              subscriptions) may be used for marketing and promotional purposes 
              by iEntry and may be shared with companies that have something of 
              value to offer. If a guest objects to such use for any reason, he/she 
              may stop that use -- either by e-mail request or by modifying his/her 
              registration information online. </p>
            <p><span class="contentTextB">Cookies</span><br>
              Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an 
              individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes while at the 
              site. Cookies make Web-surfing easier by, among other things, saving 
              your passwords and preferences for you. The use of cookies is an 
              industry standard, and you'll find cookies at most major Web sites.</p>
            <p>Cookies help make iEntry better, by showing how and when guests 
              use the site. Many content improvements and updates are based on 
              such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information 
              is most easily tracked with cookies. A cookie lets iEntry remember 
              that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future 
              activities at our sites. The cookie itself does not contain any 
              personally identifying information although it may enable iEntry 
              to relate a user's use of iEntry to personally identifying information 
              that has previously been submitted by the user, if any. </p>
            <p>You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. These cookies 
              are sent from third-party computers and are subject to such third 
              parties' policies. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. 
              If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, it 
              is likely that most areas of the site will not function properly 
              if you do so. </p>
            <p><span class="contentTextB">Removal from our Database</span><br>
              Should you ever wish to be removed from our database, simply contact 
              us and we will be happy to fulfill your request. Additionally, should 
              you wish further clarification of this policy, please do not hesitate
