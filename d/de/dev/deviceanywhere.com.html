          connection with your activities on or related to this 
          website referencing this Privacy Policy. This Privacy

          We are continually improving and adding new functionality 
          and features to this website and improving and adding 
          to our existing products, services, and programs. Because 
          of these ongoing changes, changes in the law, and the 
          changing nature of technology, our data practices will 
          change from time to time. If and when such data practices 
          change, we will post the changes on this website to notify 
          you of the changes. We encourage you to check this page 
          frequently. This Privacy Policy was last updated on January 
          15, 2004.<br>

                                Collected</span><br>
          In the course of operating this website, Mobile Complete 
          may collect two types of information about its users: 
          Personal Information and Anonymous Information. <br>
                              <br>
          “Personal Information” is personally identifiable information, 
          such as your name, email address, title, phone number, 
          and company name. Personal Information is collected by 
          us only when you choose to provide it to us, such as when 
          you use this website to signup with Mobile Complete, or 
          use this website to contact Mobile Complete with questions 
          and comments. In addition, if you choose to contact any 
          of our customer service representatives, we may keep a 
          record of that correspondence to fully address the subject 
          matter. <br>
                              <br>
          In addition to the information you provide when you use 
          our website, we use technology to collect “Anonymous Information” 
          about the use of our website. For example, we use technology 
          to track how many visitors access our website, the date 
          and time of their visit, the length of their stay, and 
          which pages they view. We also use technology to determine 
          which web browsers our visitors use and the address from 
          which they accessed our website. <br>
                              <br>
          This technology does not identify you personally. It simply 
          enables us to compile statistics about our visitors and 
          their use of our website. Mobile Complete uses this anonymous 
          data and shares it with third parties to improve the content 
          and functionality of our website, to better understand 
          our customers and markets, and to improve our products 
          and services.<br>
                              <br>

          A “cookie” is a small amount of data, which often includes 
          an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser 
          when you access a website. This data is stored on your 
          computer’s hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie 
          to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, 
          but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits 
          a website to access the cookies it has already sent to 
          you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Cookies 
          cannot be used to discover the identity of a user. <br>
                              <br>
          Mobile Complete uses cookies to facilitate and enhance 
          your experience on our website, such as to give your direct 
          access to our Downloads section after you have entered 
          your contact information once; that way you are not required 
          to enter your contact information each time you wish to 
          download a product or document from our website. Additionally, 
          you may configure your browser to reject cookies sent 
          by Mobile Complete; your ability to view and browse our 
          website will not be impaired in any manner even if you 
          were to block cookies sent by Mobile Complete. <br>

          Other than as expressly described in this Privacy Policy, 
          we will not share, sell, or rent Personal Information 
          with anyone outside of Mobile Complete Inc, without your 
          prior permission. In addition, we may disclose Personal 
          Information as required by law, including by an order 
          of any court, institution or body with jurisdiction or 
          authority to compel the production of information, or 
          in order to protect or defend a legal interest.<br>

          The security of Personal Information is important to us. 
          Mobile Complete takes technical, contractual, administrative, 
          and physical security steps to protect Personal Information 
          that you provide to us, as well as business related information 
          that you enter when using our products and services. We 
          instruct our employees with access to your Personal Information 
          that it is to be used only in adherence with the principles 
          set forth in this Privacy Policy. <br>
                              <br>
          We also protect your Personal Information during transmission 
          by using industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
          technology that includes both server authentication as 
          well as data encryption.<br>
