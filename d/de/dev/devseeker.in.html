			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			<div id="acaj_1_2_1" style="font-size: 12px;">

				<b>Overview</b><br> <br> We have created this Privacy Policy to
				demonstrate our commitment to protecting information you submit.
				This Privacy Policy only applies to data gathered on the
				www.devseeker.in web site (the "Site"), and does not apply to any
				other information or web site. Please review this Privacy Policy
				periodically as we may UPDATE devseeke_v2011.it from time to time.
				This Privacy Policy is effective as of April 17, 2005. Each time you
				visit the Site or provide us with information, you are, by doing so,
				accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that
				time. You agree that by using the Site you are expressly and
				affirmatively consenting to our use and disclosure of the
				information that you provide, and consenting to receive emails, as
				described below in this Privacy Policy. <br> <br> <b>Personal
					Information</b><br> <br> In order to operate the Site in an
				efficient and effective manner and provide users with information on
				job postings and services that may be of interest to them,
				www.devseeker.in may collect personal information, including contact
				information (such as an email address), from its users. In addition,
				this information allows us to provide users with private and secure
				areas to post and modify their original content on our site (e.g.,
				jobs and resumes). We also automatically track certain information
				based upon your behavior on the Site and use this information to do
				internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and
				behavior to better understand, protect and serve users in general.
				This information may include the URL that a user has just come from
				(whether this URL is on our Site or not), the URL a user goes to
				next (whether this URL is on our Site or not), a user's computer
				browser information, and their IP address.<br> You agree that
				www.devseeker.in may use your personal information to contact you
				and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to
				your interests (such as relevant job postings and services), or
				provides administrative notices or communications applicable to your
				use of the Site. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly
				agree to receive this information. If you do not wish to receive
				these communications, we encourage you to opt out of any further
				receipt by following the opt out provisions provided in each such
				communication.<br> <br> We do not sell our users' personal
				information to anyone for any reason if the user has indicated a
				desire for us to keep the information private. When posting jobs and
				resumes, our users decide for themselves how much contact
				information they wish to display (we enable private communication
				for those who choose to hide this information).<br> <br> All users
				should be aware, however, that when they voluntarily display or
				distribute personal information (such as their email address or
				resume), that information can be collected and used by others. This
				may result in unsolicited messages from third parties for which
				www.devseeker.in is not responsible. Also, you may have arrived at
				this Web site by following a link from a www.devseeker.in newspaper
				affiliate or other affiliate. If so, please be aware that
				www.devseeker.in may share your information with that affiliate and
				the affiliate may use the information consistent with its privacy
				policy instead of this one.<br> <br> www.devseeker.in may also
				disclose specific user information when we determine that such
				disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or
				seek assistance from law enforcement or to protect the interests or
				safety of www.devseeker.in or other users of the Site. In addition,
				personal information we have collected may be passed on to a third
				party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a
				bankruptcy of www.devseeker.in<br> <br> <b>What You Should Know</b><br>
				<br> www.devseeker.in cannot ensure that all of your private
				communications and other personal information will never be
				disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
				Therefore, although we are committed to protecting your privacy, we
				do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal
				information or private communications will always remain private. As
				a user of the Site, you understand and agree that you assume all
				responsibility and risk for your use of the Site, the internet
				generally, and the documents you post or access and for your conduct
				on and off the Site.<br> <br> <b>Protect Yourself</b><br> <br> *
				Never give your social security number to a prospective employer.<br>
				* Never provide credit card or bank numbers or monetary transaction
				of any sort.<br> * Be cautious when dealing with contacts outside of
				your own country.<br> * Do not provide any non-work related personal
				information (i.e. social security number, eye color, etc.) over the
				phone or online.
