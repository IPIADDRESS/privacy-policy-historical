          <h1>Devmaster Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Devmaster may collect certain information from you on or through this website (the "<strong>Site</strong>").
  Devmaster, LLC uses this information to deliver the services offered on the Site, to inform you of changes to
  the Site or your account, to enhance the Site, to prevent illegal or potentially prohibited conduct, and to
  enforce our Terms of Use (the "<strong>Terms</strong>"), which incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy governs Devmaster's information management policies including, without limitation, how
  Devmaster gathers, stores or shares your information, if at all. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
  this Privacy Policy does not apply to information that is gathered or collected offline.</p>

<p>By using the Site and by submitting information to Devmaster, you agree to the practices described in this
  Privacy Policy and to any other applicable terms, including the Terms. The information collected from this Site
  may be retained indefinitely, and may be stored, accessed, and used in jurisdictions whose privacy laws may be
  different or less protective than those of your home jurisdiction.</p>

<p>We take your privacy very seriously and we work hard to earn and keep your trust. As such, we adhere to the
  following basic principles to protect your privacy:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We do not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>We do not share your contact information without your consent.</p></li>
<li><p>Any personally identifiable information that you provide will be secured with industry standard protocols and technology.</p></li>

</ul>

<p><strong>1.  <u>Information about Cookies</u></strong></p>

<p>Some features and advertisements on the Site may contain "cookies" or similar preference-tracking technologies.
  A cookie is a small data file stored by your Internet browser, provided that your computer is set to accept cookies.
  Cookies help improve the user experience by identifying and gathering information about a user, their browser and
  preferences for websites they have already visited. The use of cookies allows us to better understand how our users
  interact with the Site so we can work to improve your user experience.</p>

<p>Most modern Internet browsers allow you to change your settings to prevent the storage of new cookies, receive
  warnings prior to their storage, or to delete cookies from your computer altogether. Please review your browser's
  instructions for more information, or visit http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq. Please be aware that if you choose
  to disable cookies, some portions of the Site may cease functioning properly.</p>

<p><strong>2.  <u>Third-Party Providers</u></strong></p>

<p>Devmaster does not and cannot control cookies in advertisements placed by our authorized advertising partners.
  This Privacy Policy does not govern the privacy practices of third parties who gather information directly from
  you to provide advertisements on this Site and other websites. The Site may embed or contain links and advertisements
  for third party websites. Similarly, third-party websites may embed or contain links and advertisements for the Site.
  Devmaster cannot control and is not responsible for the privacy practices or content on any non-Devmaster websites.
  Devmaster is therefore not liable for your use of and exposure to such third-party websites and any content or
  advertisements they contain. You should familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and terms of use of these
  third parties to better understand their information management policies.</p>

<p>If you choose to opt in to receive communications from a third party, any information you provide to said third party,
  will be subject to the privacy policy of the third party. If you later decide to opt out, you should contact the third
  party directly.</p>

<p><strong>3.  <u>No Spam, Spyware or Spoofing</u></strong></p>

<p>We do not tolerate spam. You are not licensed or otherwise permitted to add other users on the Site to your mailing
  list (email or physical mail, or any other medium) without their explicit consent. To report spam or spoof emails to
  Devmaster, please forward the email to web@devmaster.net. You may not use our communication tools to send spam or
  otherwise send content that would violate the Terms.</p>

<p><strong>4.  <u>Anonymous Information</u></strong></p>

<p>Your use of the Site will be anonymous unless you provide us with personally identifiable information or have
  provided such information in the past. Devmaster may, from time to time, collect certain anonymous information about
  your visits to the Site including, but not limited to, information regarding: (1) the date, time and length of your
  visit; (2) your Internet browser, operating system or Internet service provider; and (3) the referring site,
  advertisement or email linking to and from the Site. If you access the Site via a wireless device, we may collect
  information about your wireless device and your wireless communications carrier. Devmaster may aggregate, use and
  share anonymous user information with third parties for marketing and advertising purposes.</p>

<p><strong>5.  <u>Personally Identifiable Information</u></strong></p>

<p>Devmaster is committed to maintaining and protecting your privacy and is committed to protecting personally
  identifiable information that you provide in connection with your use of the Site.</p>

<p>In order to use certain features on the Site, including, without limitation, user comments, forums, instant
  messaging, e-mail, or social networking functions, you may need to register and create a user account ("<strong>User
    Account</strong>"). You will also be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information and other
    information about yourself, such as your full name, contact information and date of birth. You are required to
    maintain and update the information in your User Account with current, complete and accurate information.</p>

<p>Once you give us your personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us. By providing us with personal
  information, you consent to our collection and storage of your information.</p>

<p>Your name may be publicly available on the Internet when you use some features of the Site, such as user comments, 
  forums, instant messaging, e-mail, or social networking functions. Use your discretion when using these services.
  This Privacy Policy does not govern or protect any information that you have publicly disclosed on the Site. It is
  your responsibility to review what information you wish to share with members and non-members of the Site. You are
  solely responsible for any public content in your user profile. You may review, amend or delete any and all
  information and content associated with your User Account by signing in to your account on the Site. You may also
  request the deactivation of your User Account by sending an e-mail to web@devmaster.net.</p>

<p>Your use of the Site and your provision of any personally identifiable information constitutes your consent for
  Devmaster to provide your information to third parties who provide certain support services, such as processing of
  credit card transactions, or customer service, as applicable. In all cases, these third parties are explicitly
  prohibited from using, sharing, selling or otherwise distributing your customer data for their own marketing purposes,
  unless you choose to opt in for such additional uses and/or disclosure by the third parties, under their respective
  privacy policies.</p>

<p><strong>6.  <u>Children and Privacy</u></strong></p>

<p>This Site is NOT directed towards children under the age of 13. Devmaster recognizes the importance of maintaining
  the privacy of children, especially those under the age of 13. Devmaster is committed to complying with all applicable
  laws and regulations regarding children, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection
  Act ("<strong>COPPA</strong>"), 15 U.S.C. § 6501, et seq.</p>

<p>Except in limited circumstances allowed by COPPA, Devmaster does not and will not knowingly request, collect, store,
  maintain, or share any personally identifiable information of children under the age of 13, without first obtaining
  the consent of a legal guardian.  In those limited instances, Devmaster will only collect reasonably necessary information,
  and Devmaster will not share with third parties any personally identifiable information of a child under the age of 13
  without the explicit consent of a legal guardian, or as permitted by COPPA or other applicable law.</p>

<p>You may revoke your consent and request the removal of your child's information at any time. If you are the legal
  guardian of a child under the age of 13 and discover that your child has submitted their personally identifiable
  information without securing your consent, Devmaster will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove this information.
  If at any point you wish to review, amend, or request the removal of your child's information, please send an e-mail
  to web@devmaster.net, and provide the name and account information for your child's user account.</p>

<p><strong>7.  <u>How We Use Your Information</u></strong></p>

<p>Devmaster may send you correspondence unless you opt out when you register your User Account. You may opt out from
  receiving further marketing messages by following the "unsubscribe" directions in each message. Notwithstanding the
  foregoing, Devmaster reserves the right contact you about your account status, technical support, changes to account
  terms, and any other circumstances that might affect our service to you.</p>

<p>Devmaster will not sell, license, rent, or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information except as stated
  herein, or under the following circumstances: (1) you have given your consent; (2) we previously you of the disclosure
  in this Privacy Policy or when you provided your information on the Site; (3) we are compelled by law, legal process, or
  court order to disclose; (4) disclosure is required to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may
  cause harm to, or interference with, Devmaster's rights or property, our users, or anyone else; or (5) to respond to an
  inquiry, request or complaint that you have made. Devmaster may cooperate with Internet service providers to identify
  users whenever required to comply with law, to enforce compliance with this Privacy Policy or our Terms, or to protect
  the Site, our customers and others.</p>

<p>Devmaster reserves the right to retain customer data for closed accounts, as necessary to: (1) comply with applicable
  laws; (2) prevent fraud; (3) resolve disputes; (4) troubleshoot problems; (5) assist law enforcement officials with any
  investigations; (6) enforce the Terms; and (6) take other actions otherwise permitted by law.</p>

<p><strong>8.  <u>Data Security</u></strong></p>

<p>Devmaster uses industry standard technologies to safeguard your data from unauthorized use and disclosure and to
  prohibit possible security breaches of the Site. Unfortunately no website, computer system or online communication is
  completely secure. Devmaster cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will
  never occur. Your use of the Site is at your own risk.</p>

<p>Devmaster will take commercially reasonable steps to use heightened security technologies to protect the transmission
  and storage of transactional information to the Site. Such heightened security measures may include the secure
  transmission and encryption of all supplied sensitive financial or other transaction-related information. Such
  information will only be accessible by authorized individuals with special access rights to our payment systems.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, whenever you make a purchase, your financial and other transaction-related information
  will only be used to process your transaction and will not be stored on our servers or used for marketing purposes.</p>

<p><strong>9.  <u>Notification of Changes</u></strong></p>

<p>Devmaster may at any time and in its sole discretion, add, modify, or remove any feature, function or portion of
  the Site, the Terms, and/or the Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, with or without notice to you, prior or otherwise.
  Any changes to the Privacy Policy will be effective as of the posting date. Devmaster will provide prominent notice on
  the Site of any major changes to the Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Site after Devmaster posts any
  modifications to the Privacy Policy shall be deemed your explicit acceptance of those modifications and shall
  constitute your agreement to comply with the Privacy Policy, as modified.</p>
