						<p><strong>Last Revision - January 9, 2012</strong></p>

						<p>It is the policy of CitizenGroove, Inc. to respect the privacy of decisiondesk.com Members.  We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive when you visit and use our website located at <a href="http://www.decisiondesk.com">www.decisiondesk.com</a>, (collectively the “Site”).  This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to CitizenGroove through the Site, and when you access, download, purchase or use any information, services, products or content appearing on the Site.  This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site.  You should consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.</p>
						<p>Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose to any member's name or contact information or Personal Information (defined below).  CitizenGroove will also not monitor, edit, or disclose member's information unless required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) cooperate with law enforcement authorities or comply with legal process served on decisiondesk.com; (2) to protect the property and rights of CitizenGroove, Inc. or a third party; or (3) to protect the safety of the public or any person; (4) to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable; or (5) fix or debug problems with the decisiondesk.com servers, software or service.</p>

						<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
						<p>The Site is not directed to children under 13 years of age, and CitizenGroove  requires users of its service to be 13 years of age or older.  Accordingly, CitizenGroove does not knowingly collect or maintain on its Site personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@decisiondesk.com.  If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.  We require that minors over the age of 13 obtain parent or guardian for permission before utilizing the Site and we further recommend such minors obtain parent or guardian for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>

						<h2>THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
						<p>When you register to become a member of decisiondesk.com or utilize CitizenGroove’s products for the submission of any audition or application data, including any related audio and video recordings, and in the course of using the Site, you may voluntarily submit personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account (“Personal Information”).  Personal information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number and e-mail address.  CitizenGroove may also collect Personal Information from you if you choose to opt-in to participate in sweepstakes, surveys, contests or competitions.  When you register with CitizenGroove, you create your own profile for the purpose of submitting audition recordings or to apply to items such as, but not limited to, contests, awards, events, or universities. Your profile information, as well as your name, e-mail and photo, are displayed to people you have specified in your audition or application.  Profile information you submit to CitizenGroove, and made public via any public audition or application process, will also be available to other CitizenGroove users via searching the applicable Site, and may be available to third party search engines.  This is primarily so your friends and anyone else can find you and the content you create and store on decisiondesk.com.  We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information to the extent that you upload to any public auditions or applications.</p>
						<p>As you use the Site, our servers automatically record information that the browser sends whenever it points to a Site or online service (“Log Data”).  Log Data may include, but is not limited to, your computer’s Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to one of the Site and information you search for, or view on a Site.  This includes your music listening habits on the Site and the profile information you view on the Site.</p>

						<h2>HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

Further, you may easily adjust your privacy and e-mail settings via your account settings at any time.</p>

						<h2>OTHER INFORMATION/LOGGING AND COOKIES</h2>
						<p>Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information.  A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  We use “persistent cookies” to save your username and login password for future logins to the Site.  We use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of our service, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor web traffic routing on the Site and aggregate usage of the Site.

You post and share your Personal Information and content on the Site at your own risk.  While we go to great lengths to create a safe and enjoyable experience on the Site, we cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your content and/or profile information or institutions to which you submit applications and auditions.  In addition, we cannot anticipate other users’ ability to circumvent privacy settings.  You understand that, even after removal of your Personal Information and content from the Site, copies of your information may remain viewable in cached or archived Web pages or on the local computers of users who may have downloaded or stored your information.   Even with all the appropriate precautions CitizenGroove takes to protect your information, we recommend you refrain from sending private information or Personal Information by e-mail, chat, or other messaging services.</p>
						<p><span class="underline">Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.</span>  We may share aggregated information that includes non-identifying information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services, all for the sole benefit of CitizenGroove, Inc.  Members and non-member visitors shall not be entitled to any compensation stemming from such aggregated or non-identifying information.</p>
						<p><span class="underline">Service Providers.</span>  We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the our services, to provide the services on our behalf, to perform services related to administration of the Site (including, without limitation, maintenance, hosting and database management services, web analytics and administration).

						<p>CitizenGroove is concerned with safeguarding your information.  We employ a variety of industry-standard measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.</p>

						<h2>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</h2>
						<p>Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.  If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to CitizenGroove, please be advised that we transfer Personal Information to the United States and process it there.  Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

						<p>The Site contains links to other websites.  If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website.  The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.
