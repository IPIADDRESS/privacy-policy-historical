				<p>1.2. <strong>Notice Concerning Children</strong>.  The services offered by the Company include on-line surveys.  Some of the surveys provided by the Company are directed at children under the age of 13.

Of course, we understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children’s privacy online. As a result, at any time, a parent of a minor who has responded to any survey hosted on this website may contact the Company at the address noted below and request that we (i) disclose to the parent any personal information maintained in connection with their child, (ii) delete from our system any personal information maintained in connection with their child, or (iii) refuse to allow any further collection or use of their child’s personal information.</p>
