<h1>DECIDE</h1>
<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<h2>Last Updated: June, 16 2011</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is collected, used and disclosed
by Decide Inc., and our subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, "Decide," "we" or "us"),
with respect to your use of our websites, including www.decide.com, and our other online and mobile
websites and applications (collectively, the "Sites"), and the Decide service offered through the Sites
(the "Service").</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes
have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this
Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will
be used.</p>

<h3>What Is Personal Information?</h3>

<p>As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an
individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, email address or credit card
number), or information about an individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information.
Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use
of the Sites or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other
personal information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of
aggregate information.</p>

<h3>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h3>

<p><u>Active Collection:</u> Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit our Sites.
We collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us, such as when you create an account, sign
up to receive email alerts or newsletters, provide or request information or participate in our surveys,
sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers or other activities on our Sites. Such information may
include your name, email address, postal address, telephone number and other contact or demographic
information.</p>

<p><u>Passive Collection:</u> When you use the Sites, some information is also automatically collected, such as
your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, operating system, browser type, the address of a referring website
and your activity on the Sites. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or
link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.</p>

<p>We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small
data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website. Among other things, cookies help us
improve our Sites and your experience. If we link cookies to any personally identifying information, we
will treat this information as personal information. If you wish to block, erase or be warned of cookies,
please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions. However, if you choose to
remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services on our Sites.</p>

<p>In addition, we may use Web beacons or similar technology on the Site. Web beacons are small, invisible
graphic images that may be used on the Site or in emails relating to the Site to collect certain information
and monitor user activity on the Site, such as to count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness
