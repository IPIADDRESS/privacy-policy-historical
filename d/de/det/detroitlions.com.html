<p>TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT MAY BE COLLECTED </p>
<p>The following are the types of information we may collect:&nbsp; </p>

We also may keep track of what emails we send you and what emails you may be receiving from our subsidiaries and affiliates.&nbsp; Additionally, we keep a record of what communications you have opted to receive or not to receive. </p>
<p>HOW INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED</p>
<p>We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Website, including but not limited to those described below:</p>

<p>Cookies:&nbsp; The Detroit Lions site uses session variables to track a customer’s path while they are on the site.&nbsp; No identifiable information about the customer’s location or private information is made available from this variable.&nbsp; Because information is temporarily written to a customer’s hard drive, this variable can appear to operate as a cookie.&nbsp; <br>However, the Detroit Lions collect no information from this variable, and the item written to the customer’s harddrive is deleted when the browser is closed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technology:&nbsp; Our Website uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites. We also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Web sites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Web sites. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable</p>
<p>IP Addresses and Click-Stream Data: We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data. An IP address is a number associated with the service through which you access the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors, for example regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information.&nbsp; Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Website. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Website, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.</p>
<p>Transaction Information: If you conduct a financial transaction with our Website, such as order information from our Website, buy our products, or subscribe to services offered on our Website, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including contact information, demographic information and financial information.&nbsp; We will use this information to complete the transaction that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the information, products or other services that you order, and to invoice you.&nbsp; For your protection, such information is collected and stored through encrypted means. </p>
<p>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED </p>
<p>As applicable, the information you provide to us may be used to:</p>
<p>contact you about the Website; </p>
<p>contact you relating to your membership status; </p>

<p>monitor compliance with our terms and conditions of use of the Website; and</p>
<p>send you promotional material or special offers on behalf of our marketing partners and/or their respective affiliates and subsidiaries and other third parties.</p>
<p>WITH WHOM THE INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED</p>
<p>At times, we may share your personal information with others for various purposes.&nbsp; The following outlines the ways in which your information may be shared with others and the ways in which you may opt-out of having your information shared:</p>
<p>Agents: We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, Website analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for their own purposes, like sending you marketing offers about their products.</p>
<p>Aggregate Information: We may share aggregate information, such as demographics and Website usage statistics, with advertisers, sponsors or other organizations. When this type of information is shared, the other parties do not have access to your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Other Promotional Offers:&nbsp; We may send offers to you on behalf of our marketing partners. When we do this, we do not give that partner your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, you may opt out or unsubscribe.&nbsp; See “Newsletters and Website Emails” section above.</p>
<p>Business Transfers:&nbsp; In the event that all or substantially all of our assets are sold or transferred to another party, or another transaction occurs in which your personally identifiable information is one of the business assets transferred, all personally identifiable information that has been collected and saved may be one of the business assets we transfer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Administrative or Legal Process:&nbsp; Your personal information may be transferred to third parties without notice to you in order to comply with applicable law, law enforcement agencies, to protect our rights, or protect the rights of other users of this website. </p>
<p>CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS, AND MESSAGE BOARDS </p>
<p>The Website may make chat rooms, forums and message boards available to its users. You are not required to provide any personal information when using these areas but you may choose to do so. If you post personal information online, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. We cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public in a chat room, forum, or message board. Also, we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas.</p>
<p>LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</p>
<p>You should be aware that when you are on the Website you could be directed to other Websites beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Website onto a different Website. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and marketing partners that may use the Website's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a Website that is linked to our Website, you should consult that Website's privacy policy before providing any personal information.</p>
<p>SECURITY </p>
<p>This Website incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy of the personal information that we may collect and we have put into place reasonable precautions to protect such information from loss, misuse and alteration. Your personally identifiable information is transferred to our computers utilizing encryption software. Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access. Our security policies are reviewed periodically and revised as required.</p>
