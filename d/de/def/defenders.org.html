<p>In addition to the single email you will automatically  receive above, Defenders of Wildlife may send you additional emails IF you  choose to receive further emails from them.</p>
<p><strong>Defenders of Wildlife  will not give, sell or share your email address with other organizations except  as specifically required to carry out the given action you requested. For example, if you send a message through  our systems to your </strong><strong>U.S.</strong><strong> Senators, your message will be sent to them from your email address. For a full description of our privacy policy  and the protection of your personal information, please see Privacy Policy  below. (Note: Defenders of Wildlife works with our sister  organization, Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund (<a href="http://www.defendersactionfund.org/">www.defendersactionfund.org</a>). Both organizations may contact you in a  manner consistent with that described above and below in this privacy policy.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br>
  We at Defenders of Wildlife (Defenders) want this Website to  be a safe and private place for users. Defenders  will do its part by not requiring you to register or provide any information at  all to use most of the basic features of this and our other Websites. We also provide opportunities for greater  personalization of content and offerings to enhance your experience if you  choose. In turn, you can do your part by  reading this policy, making your own informed decisions, and taking the precautions  outlined below. </p>
<p>There are certain actions and areas of the site that will  require you to provide personal information, such as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>taking  an action through our Defenders Wildlife   Action Center  or one of our campaign or other sites</li>
  <li>registering  for our enewsletters or other emails</li>
  <li>making  a donation</li>
  <li>adopting  an animal or making a gift through our Wildlife   Adoption &amp; Gift Center  (<a href="http://www.wildlifeadoption.org">www.wildlifeadoption.org</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>This privacy policy does not apply when you use this Website  as a portal to click through to other Websites including certain shopping Websites  affiliated with Defenders of Wildlife.  For example, Defenders of Wildlife merchandise is sold through an  affiliated Website with its own privacy policy.  Please review the new site’s privacy policy to determine the treatment  and collection of your information if you leave this site. </p>
<p>We will update this privacy policy as we deem necessary, so  please be sure to reread it from time to time.  By submitting your personal information to us, you are agreeing that  Defenders of Wildlife and <a href="http://www.defendersactionfund.org/about_us/index.html">Defenders of Wildlife  Action Fund</a> may  use the information in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, please  contact us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:myprivacy@defenders.org">myprivacy@defenders.org</a> or through the address at the end of  this privacy policy below.<br>
<br>
    <strong>Personal Information You May Choose to  Provide</strong>: <br>
  In order to utilize certain features of our site or receive information from  Defenders, you may choose to provide information. If you do submit information to us, we will  use that information for the purposes for which it was submitted. We may also  use your information in other ways, such as to contact you about other Defenders  activities and/or fundraising campaigns or as otherwise disclosed to you at the  point of collection. For example:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>If you join our main email list by registering  for Defenders Wildlife eNews</strong>, we will have a record of your email  address and all other information you choose to provide. We will send you  Wildlife eNews and also may contact you with action alerts to save wildlife, fundraising  campaigns, and other Defenders activities.</li>
  <li><strong>If you make an online donation to Defenders</strong>, your information will be  added to our donor list and database, and you may be contacted about other Defenders  activities, news, action alerts, and/or fundraising campaigns. Defenders may rent our donor list (mail  addresses, only) to like-minded organizations.  This provides you with the opportunity to learn about related activities  of other nonprofit organizations. If you  do not wish to have your mail contact information shared in this manner, please  contact us at <a href="mailto:membership@defenders.org">memberservices@defenders.org</a>. Defenders will not share your email address  or credit card information with other organizations.</li>
  <li><strong>If you join or opt-in to our activist  network</strong>, you will receive informational updates and action alerts on wildlife  and related issues. You also may be  contacted about other Defenders activities, news, action alerts, and/or  fundraising campaigns. Our activist network is an electronic network, and therefore  we need an e-mail address to contact you. We also need your full postal address  in order for our systems to match you to the correct state and federal  districts, thereby ensuring that you are primarily sending messages to your  designated elected officials. Defenders  will not rent mail addresses of our activist list to other organizations.</li>
  <li><strong>When you take an action such as sending a message  to your elected representatives, government officials or other targets of  Defenders advocacy, we will send your message to these recipients, along with  the contact information you provide on the input form, typically including your  name, address, and email address.  Defenders is not responsible for what these recipients may do with your  information. Please note that officials  receiving these emails may choose to contact you. In addition, sometimes government agencies  add the names of people who submit comments on government proposals into public  documents recording the names of people who’ve commented in favor or opposed to  a given proposal. This is often a part  of the government process for receiving and recording feedback from the  public. Government agencies typically  have strict guidelines around not misusing information provided to them by the  public for other purposes. However, you  should review the policies of the appropriate government body if you are  concerned.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>We will receive any other information you  choose to provide</strong>. For example,  we may manage blogs or allow you to post stories or photos from time to time. By submitting such information to us, you  give us permission to post it in the designated area on our Website, edit it,  or remove it if we deem that the content is not appropriate, outdated, etc. To protect your privacy, please do not  include any identifying information when submitting blog entries or stories.</li>
</ol>
<p>Defenders of Wildlife works with our sister organization,  Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund (<a href="http://www.defendersactionfund.org/">www.defendersactionfund.org</a>). Both organizations may contact you in a  manner consistent with that described above and below in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Many of our Websites are jointly operated by Defenders of  Wildlife and our sister organization, the Defenders of Wildlife Action  Fund. These sites include: Defenders  Wildlife Action Center (<a href="http://action.defenders.org">http://action.defenders.org</a>),  and Defenders sentinel sites such as <a href="http://www.saveesa.org/">www.saveesa.org</a>, <a href="http://www.savearcticrefuge.org/">www.savearcticrefuge.org</a>, and <a href="http://www.wolfcampaign.org/">www.wolfcampaign.org</a>. Your privacy will be protected on these sites  in accordance with this privacy policy as they are on Websites operated solely  by Defenders of Wildlife. Websites jointly operated by Defenders of Wildlife  and the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund will be clearly noted—typically in  the footer. </p>
<p>You should be aware that we use third-party vendors to  provide services on this site and in our offline business operations. The  information that you submit on this site may be provided to those vendors on a  confidential basis so that those vendors can provide services (such as maintaining  our database, sending e-mail messages to activists, facilitating our  fundraising activities and campaigns, or processing credit card transactions)  on our behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Other than as described in this privacy policy, or  as may be necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of our  organization or others, or as may be necessary to comply with applicable law, Defenders  will not give, share or sell the personal information you provide online.</strong><br>
</p>
<p><strong>Financial Information You  May Choose to Provide</strong>: <br>
If you choose to make an online donation to Defenders, you will have to provide  your credit card billing information. As this information is collected and  transferred over the Internet to our secure server, it is encrypted using  Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, the  industry standard security technology that is designed to protect sensitive  information. Our donation pages display the Verisign Secure Site Seal to assure  you that our Website is authentic and that all transactions are secured by SSL  encryption. If you are making a donation, the credit card information that you  provide at the time of donation is used only to process your donation and will  not be used by us for any other purposes.  For more information on our security policies, please see the "Security"  section below.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Automatically Collect and  Store</strong>: <br>
  As is true of most Web sites you enter, we automatically collect and store some  information about your computer and your visit and store it in log files. This  information includes information such as your computer's (or your Internet  Service Provider's) Internet Protocol (IP) address (this is not your e-mail  address); the domain from which you access the Internet (e.g., "AOL.com"  or "Princeton.edu"); the name, version, and specifications of your  computer and your computer's operating system; the Internet address of the Website,  if any, from which you came to our site; the date and time you arrived at our  site and how long you spent on the site; and which pages you visited. </p>
<p>We use this information to formulate statistics that show  the number of visitors to the different sections of our site and to help us  make our site more useful to visitors. For example, we use the browser information  to help us design our Website so that as many people as possible will be able  to view the pages correctly. These statistics do not reveal personal  information.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Use of "Cookies" and Disabling  "Cookies"</strong>: <br>
  Cookies are small text files that are either placed on your computer's hard  drive ("persistent cookies") or in your computer's Random Access  Memory ("session cookies"). We use both persistent cookies and  session cookies on our Websites.<br>
  <br>
<strong>Session Cookies:</strong> We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate certain sections  of our Websites. If you choose to provide personal information by using an  interactive application on our site, such as by signing up for Defenders  Wildlife eNews, or joining our activist network, or making an online donation  to Defenders, we place a session cookie on your computer so that you will be  recognized as you move around the Web pages. This information is only used for fifteen  minutes. For example, if you join our activist network and then navigate through  different pages of our Websites, the cookie may maintain the information you  entered when you filled out the activist registration page. As you move through  the site, any fields requiring information about you that have already been  captured may automatically appear. However, after approximately fifteen  minutes, the session cookie times out. If you return to our Website later, your  personal information fields will not be filled automatically.</p>
<p><strong>"Remember Me" Persistent  Cookies:</strong> We use "Remember Me" persistent cookies—only if you opt-in to them—to  enhance your experience while visiting any of our Websites. A Remember Me persistent cookie remains on  your hard drive for an extended period of time and may contain a reference to  your personal information such as your name and address stored in a secure  database. Remember Me and other cookies  do NOT contain reference to your credit card number / financial  information. Remember Me cookies enable  us to perform functions such as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Prefilling  your personal information into forms such as registration forms, take action  forms, or donation forms. The Remember  Me cookies will not time-out after fifteen minutes.</li>
  <li>Providing  a personal greeting to you (e.g., "Hello Sally") on the homepage of our Wildlife   Action Center  (<u><a href="http://action.defenders.org/site/PageServer?pagename=rememberme">http://action.defenders.org/rememberme</a></u>),  on homepages of our sites, or in other places.</li>
  <li>Displaying  information relevant to actions you have taken.  For example, in our Wildlife Action   Center we can show Recent Actions  You’ve Taken through Defenders.</li>
  <li>Providing  you with actions, events, or other information that is relevant to you or will  enhance your user experience. For  example, in our Wildlife Action   Center, we may display actions for California  activists only to those who have California  addresses; for Ohio activists, we  can display Ohio-specific actions, but not actions specific to other states;  etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Defenders only will use Remember Me persistent cookies on  your computer if you opt-in to their use.  No Remember Me cookies will be placed on your computer unless you opt-in. Defenders also may use other types of  persistent cookies that do not contain a reference to your personal information  for limited tasks such as ensuring that a user cannot take a survey more than  once from a given computer. </p>
<p>See "Your Help is Needed" section below for more information  on protecting your information.</p>
<p><strong>Defenders of Wildlife  and Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund share cookies across our sites.</strong> In other words, if you navigate between sites  owned and operated by Defenders of Wildlife and Defenders of Wildlife Action  Fund during one session, session cookies will be used as described above. Likewise, if you choose to opt-in to Remember  Me persistent cookies on this site or any other site owned and operated by  Defenders of Wildlife, these cookies will make the same features and  functionality available on sites owned and operated by Defenders of Wildlife  Action Fund. The converse is also  true. If you opt-in to Remember Me  cookies via a Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund site, the uses above will  persist on Defenders of Wildlife sites. </p>
<p><strong>Disabling Cookies:</strong> Persistent cookies leave a record on  your computer that you have visited our sites. However, you have the ability to  remove cookies from your computer. Your Internet browser's "Help"  section will give you information on how to delete cookies. In addition, there  are many Websites that provide browser- and operating system-specific  information on how to delete cookies. When thinking about whether you want to  delete cookies, you should be aware that some sites require cookies to function  properly. After you delete cookies, you may have to re-register with some sites  or you may notice difficulty in browsing some sites.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Gifs (Web  Beacons):</strong><br>
  We may choose at some point to employ a software technology  called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) that can help to better manage content  on our sites by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny  graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used  to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are  stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on  Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. </p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong><br>
This Website has security measures in place to protect the  loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. The security  measures used on this site include, but are not limited to, industry-standard  Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, Verisign certificates, firewalls, and  internal policies to maintain the security of stored data. While we follow  generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information  submitted to us, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of  electronic storage, is 100 percent secure. Therefore, while we strive to use  commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot  guarantee its absolute security. </p>
<p>After you take action and opt-in to our activist network  through our Wildlife Action   Center (<a href="http://action.defenders.org">http://action.defenders.org</a>)  or sentinel sites or donate, you will have a personal subscription management  page, where you will be able to edit your personal information and edit what  email lists you wish to subscribe to. Access  to your personal subscription management page is controlled to protect the  privacy of your data — our Website requires that you log on with your e-mail  address and personal password to access your personal subscription management  page.</p>
<p>Remember, many breaches of security occur when users are not  vigilant in protecting their own information. The next section of our privacy  policy suggests some actions you can take to help control the security of your  personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Your Help Is Needed:</strong><br>
  Although Defenders does its best to protect your privacy on  this and our other Websites, we need your help.  You can help in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You  have control over your own privacy. Think carefully before providing any  personal information.</li>
  <li>Although  this site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and  alteration of the information under our control, no email or Web transmission  is completely secure against interception. If you are worried because your communication  is very sensitive, do not send it via email or submit it online. See below for additional ways to contact us.</li>
  <li>Remember  that we cannot protect your privacy once you leave our sites, such as by  "hyperlink." So when you  visit other Websites including shopping/e-commerce sites affiliated  with Defenders but managed by third party organizations, check each site's  privacy policy yourself, and be careful about the information you offer up.</li>
  <li>We  may send you personalized information via email or provide personalized links  in emails that allow data fields to be automatically populated with certain  personal information. Therefore, you should always keep your email account  information secure and not allow others to access your email account.</li>
  <li>You  should only forward our email messages to others through the "Tell A  Friend" buttons or links provided within the email. When you use your email  system's forwarding capabilities (i.e., not "Tell a Friend"), others  may be able to see your personal information in that email. Likewise, others may be able to take actions  in your name and/or access your personal information by clicking on links  personalized to you. Note: Your credit  card and other financial information will NEVER be visible to others by  clicking on links in emails to you.</li>
  <li>You  may be given the option to opt-in to a Remember Me persistent cookie on your  computer (see Use of Cookies above). Remember that once you have set a Remember  Me persistent cookie that contains a reference to your personal information,  anyone can access your personal information by using your computer. Hence, you  should not opt-in to Remember Me persistent cookies on a public computer.</li>
  <li>In  addition to the records left on your computer by cookies, your browser and  operating system contain other records of your Web browsing and other actions  (e.g., browser history). As with cookies, you can find information about how to  clear these history trails in your browser's "Help" section or  through other Web sites that provide detailed information for each browser and  operating system. See Use of Cookies — Disabling Cookies above.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How to Unsubscribe or Contact Defenders of  Wildlife About Your Information</strong>: <br>
