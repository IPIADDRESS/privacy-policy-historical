<div class="row">
<div class="content-area">
<p>This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the <a href="http://definition.org/">definition.org</a> Site and various related services (together referred to as the “Site”). Definition.org (“Definition.org,” “Us,” “Our” or “We”) is committed to protecting Your privacy online. All visitors to, or users of, Defintion.org Site are referred to, individually, as “You” or “Your.” Please read the information below to learn the following regarding Your use of this Site.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is part of Our Site Terms of Service, available at <a href="http://definition.org/terms/">definition.org/terms</a>, and by accessing or using Our Site, You agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions. The Terms of Service establishes the use, disclaimers, and limitations of liability governing the use of Our Site. <b>If You do not agree to these terms, please do not access or use this Site.</b></p>
<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, We will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes, if You have provided Us with Your email). If the Services allow You to be a registered user, You acknowledge and agree that it is Your responsibility to maintain a valid email address as a registered user, review this Site and this Privacy Policy periodically and to be aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the Site after such modifications will constitute Your: (a) acknowledgment of the modified Privacy Policy; and (b) agreement to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Capitalized terms contained herein have the same meaning as in the Terms of Service, unless defined differently in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>Types of Information Collected</h3>
<p>In order to better provide You with Our Services, We collect two types of information about Our users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from You is to provide You with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using Our Site.</p>
<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>This refers to information that lets Us know the specifics of who You are. When You engage in certain activities on this Site, such as registering for an account, ordering a product or service, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums or other public areas, or sending Us feedback, We may ask You to provide certain information about You by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for You to engage in these activities. If You elect to engage in these activities, however, We may ask that You provide Us<br>
personal information, such as Your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, employer, job title and department, birth date, age, gender, telephone and facsimile numbers, short message service (SMS) or text message address or other wireless device address, and other personal identifying information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information We ask You to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If You do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, You will not be able to engage in that activity.</p>
<h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about You based upon where You visit on Our Site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the website’s Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that You just came from, which URL You next go to, what browser You are using, the type of operating system You have, the domain name of Your Internet service provider, and Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to Your computer whenever You are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify Your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.</p>
<h3>Collection Methods and Use of Information</h3>
<p>We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about You unless You voluntarily provide it to Us. You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to Us when You: (a) register for Our Services and register Your email address with Us or (b) send email messages, submit forms, submit comments or rankings, or transmit other information by telephone or letter. We may also collect information from You at other points on Our Site that state that such information is being collected.</p>
<p>In addition, We may also collect, or Our third party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information. This information is ultimately stored in the form of store categories, and, in some cases, specific URLs. We use Your IP address to diagnose problems with Our servers, software, to administer Our Site and to gather demographic information. Our third party ad servers will also provide Us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell Us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at out Site. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze usage of the Site, Services, promotions and online media, as well as to offer You targeted products and services. We also reserve the right to use aggregate or group data about Our visitors for any other lawful purposes. Aggregate or group data is data that describes the demographics, usage and/or characteristics of Our visitors as a group. By visiting, and/or supplying Your personal information via the Site and other online media, You agree to allow Us to provide such aggregate data to any third parties at Our discretion, as lawfully permitted.</p>
<p>We will primarily use Your Personally Identifiable Information to provide Our Services to You, as required by Our agreements with You. We will also use Personally Identifiable Information to enhance the operation of Our Site, fill orders, improve Our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze Site use, improve Our product and service offerings, and customize Our Site’s content, layout, and services. We may use Personally Identifiable Information to deliver information to You and to contact You regarding administrative notices. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce Our agreements with You, including Our Site Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>Release of Information and Opt-Out</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to share the postal addresses, phone numbers or email addresses of users with third parties, including advertisers. To prevent Us from sharing this information in the future, please email Us at: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1677727b7f78565273707f787f627f797838796471"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="83e2e7eeeaedc3c7e6e5eaedeaf7eaecedadecf1e4">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>. We will not share users’ credit card numbers. Occasionally, we send e-mail messages to users to inform them of features and services available on our Sites.</p>
<p>Occasionally We may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use Our Services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that We in good faith believe to be unlawful.</p>
<p>We may also provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about Our customers’ sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>
<h3>California Privacy Rights</h3>
<p>Under California’s “Shine the Light” law [California Civil Code Section 1798.83], California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family or household use are entitled to request and obtain from Us once a calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2008 will receive information regarding 2007 sharing activities).</p>
<p>To obtain this information on behalf of Definition.org, please send an email message to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8dece9e0e4e3cdc9e8ebe4e3e4f9e4e2e3a3e2ffea"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="adccc9c0c4c3ede9c8cbc4c3c4d9c4c2c383c2dfca">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> with “Request for California Privacy Information” in the subject line and in the body of your message. We will provide the requested information to you at your email address in response. Alternatively, you can request the information by writing to us at 255 W. 36th Street, Suite 1105, New York, New York 10018.
