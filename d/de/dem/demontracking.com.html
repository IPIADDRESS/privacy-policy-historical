    <p><em><u>Personal  information</u></em> is   information that can be used to  identify you, or any other individual   to whom the information may relate,  personally. We do not collect   personal information unless you choose to provide  it to us.

    <p><em><u>Web Technology information</u></em> is   information we automatically collect from you when you  open one of our   emails or visit our site.&nbsp;  This includes information collected from the   use of cookies, web beacons  or java script.&nbsp; </p>
    <p><em><u>No  Information Collected from Children.</u></em>&nbsp;   Demon Tracking will never knowingly collect any  Personal Information   about children under the age of 13.&nbsp; If Demon Tracking obtains actual   knowledge that  it has collected Personal Information about a child   under the age of 13, that  information will be immediately deleted from   its database.&nbsp; Because it does not collect such information,  Demon Tracking has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. </p>

    <p align="left"><strong>Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Java  Script</strong></p>
    <p><a name="4" id="4"></a><em><u>Cookies:</u></em> “Cookies” are a feature in your browser software. If  enabled, we may   write cookies that may store small amounts of data on your  computer   about your visit to any of the pages of this Site. Cookies assist us  in   tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content   you  may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this site again,   cookies can  enable us to customize our content according to your   preferences. We may use  cookies to: keep track of the number of return   visits to this site; accumulate  and report aggregate, statistical   information on website usage; deliver  specific content to you based on   your interests or past viewing history; save  your password for ease of   access to our Site.&nbsp;  You can disable cookies, although the Site may not   function properly for  you. Your browser preferences can be modified to   accept or reject all cookies,  or request a notification when a cookie   is set. You may read more about cookies  at http://cookiecentral.com. In   order to use all of the features and  functionality of Demon Tracking’s   websites, you need to accept cookies. </p>
    <p> We predominately use “session” cookies,  which   are not permanently stored on your hard drive. Session cookies expire    after two hours of inactivity or when you close your browser. When you   carry  out the purchase of a service or product on our website, a large   amount of data  is processed by our system and transferred through each   page of the search or registration.  This information includes all   information you input on a registration page or &nbsp;questionnaire you   complete as part of the registration  process as well as demographic   information that is not unique to you. “Session”  cookies allow us to   keep track of this data until you have completed your  search or   registration. </p>
    <p> We may use “persistent” cookies  primarily to   ensure that we do not show you pages that you have already seen  and to   personalize your site experience and save you time. “Persistent” Cookies    enable us to recognize whether you have responded to any questionnaire   or  registration or have already been presented with an advertisement   or  information placed on the site so that we do not show you the same   information  again the next time you visit our site. The “persistent”   cookies we use will  remain on your computer after you have left our   site and will expire when you  log out of the Site or 60 days after your   last visit for security cookies, 90  days after your last visit for   payment tracking cookies, or two years after  your last visit for   advertisement cookies.</p>
    <p> We may also allow other companies to  display   advertisements to you while you are visiting our Sites. Because your    web browser must request these advertisements from the other companies’    servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just   as if  you had requested a web page from their site. We have no control   over the  practices of those third party advertisers and are not   responsible for their  technology or tracking. &nbsp;We encourage you  to   review the policies of such advertisers when you link to their website.</p>
    <p><em><u>Removing Cookies:</u></em>You have the   ability to accept, decline  or move cookies at any time by modifying   your browser settings. Please see http://cookiecentral.com.  If you   choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and    negatively impact your experience on the web site.</p>
    <p><a name="5" id="5"></a><em><u>Web Beacons</u></em><u>: </u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We   also use  electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called   single-pixel gifs,  clear gifs or action tags) that allow us to collect   certain information about your  visit to these Web pages (including the   number of users who have visited those  pages), measure and improve the   effectiveness of advertisements, and deliver  services. Web beacons are   not used to access your personally identifiable  information; they are a   technique used to compile aggregated statistics about  web site usage.   Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including  a   cookie number, time and date of page view and a description of the page   on  which the Web beacon resides. This information may be shared with   one or more  third parties so that they can understand the kinds of   visitors to the Web  pages, how those visitors use those Web Pages, and   the effectiveness of their  advertisements. WE may also use web beacons   in email messages sent to  individuals listed in our database.</p>
    <p><em><u>Disabling Web Beacons.</u></em>Because Web   beacons are the same as any  other content request, you cannot opt out   or refuse them. However, they can be  rendered ineffective by either   opting out of cookies or changing the cookie  setup in your browser.</p>
    <p><em><u>JavaScript:</u></em> We may   also use JavaScript within certain advertisements.  JavaScript is a   computer language that enhances the functionality of websites,    particularly in respect to pictures. We do not collecting any personal   data via  JavaScript but use it to analyze and improve the site’s   functions. </p>
    <p><em><u>Disabling JavaScript:</u></em>You may   deactivate JavaScript via your  browser settings or activate it the same   way. If you disable JavaScript you  will not be able to use some of the   functions of the website.</p>
    <p><em><u>IP  Addresses. </u></em>&nbsp;We  automatically   track certain information based upon your behavior on the site.  We may   use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics,    interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you   and our  community. This information may include the URL that you just   came from  (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next   go to (whether  this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser   information, and your IP  address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") is a   unique Internet  "address" which is assigned to you by your Internet   Service Provider  ("ISP"). For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable    modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular    computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers,   collecting  information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP   address does not  identify an individual by name, it may, with the   cooperation of the ISP, be  used to locate and identify an individual   using the Web. Your IP address can,  however, reveal what geographic   area you are connecting from, or which ISP you  are using. Finally,   other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may  collect the IP   addresses of those websites and their pages.</p>
    <p><em><u>Computer  Profiles. </u></em>&nbsp;Demon Tracking   may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us    understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For   instance, Demon Tracking may accumulate visitor data relating to   referring domain names, the type  of browsers used, operating system   software, screen resolutions, color  capabilities, browser plug-ins,   language settings, cookie preferences, search  engine keywords and   JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal  Identification   Information, we are able to use such visitor data to identify  you. </p>

    <p><strong>Security </strong></p>
    <p><a name="7" id="7"></a>We   endeavor to safeguard and  protect your information. When you submit   information at the website, such  information is protected both online   and offline. The servers in which we store  Personal Information are   kept in a secure physical environment. We have security  measures in   place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of  personal   information under our control. Currently, We use Secure Socket Layer    Software ("SSL") to protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL    encrypts information, including credit card numbers, names and addresses   as  they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that,   although We  take commercially reasonable technological precautions to   protect your data, no  data transmission over the Internet can be   guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Therefore, We cannot and do not warrant   that your information will be  absolutely secure. Any transmission of   data at or through this site is at your  own risk. However, access to   your information is strictly limited, and not  accessible to the public.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Changes to Privacy Statement</strong></p>
    <p>We reserve the right to make material  changes to   the substance of this Privacy Statement.&nbsp; We will post those changes   through a  prominent notice on the web site so that you will always know   what information  we gather, how we might use that information, and to   whom we will disclose it.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Your California Rights</strong></p>
    <p>A California  resident who has provided personal   information to a business with whom he/she  has established a business   relationship for personal, family, or household  purposes (“California    customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business   has  disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third   parties’  direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has   made such a  disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a   request by a California  customer, the business is required to provide a   list of all third parties to  whom personal information was disclosed   in the preceding calendar year, as well  as a list of the categories of   personal information that were disclosed.</p>
    <p> However, under the law, a business is  not   required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and    discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not   disclosing  customer’s personal information to third parties for their   direct marketing  purposes unless the customer first affirmatively   agrees to the disclosure, as  long as the business maintains and   discloses this policy. Rather, the business  may comply with the law by   notifying the customer of his or her right to  prevent disclosure of   personal information and providing a cost free means to  exercise that   right.</p>
    <p> As stated in this policy, you have  agreed to   allow us to share information with third parties for their direct    marketing purposes until you remove your information and thus, agreement   for  such disclosure. To prevent disclosure of your personal   information for use in  direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in   to such use when you provide  personally identifiable information on   one of our sites or contact us via email  to remove your information   from our database. Please note that whenever you opt  in to receive   future communications from a third party, your information will  be   subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that   you do  not want that third party to use your information, you will need   to contact the  third party directly, as we have no control over how   third parties use  information. You should always review the privacy   policy of any party that  collects your information to determine how   that entity will handle your  information.</p>
    <p> California customers may request  further   information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing   support@demontracking.com.  Please note that we are only required to respond   to one request per customer  each year, and we are not required to   respond to requests made by means other  than through this e-mail   address.</p>
