<h4>1. Why is my information needed?</h4>

<p>Demio, INC is a web based and desktop based application; because of this they may require the use of first and last
    names, billing contact information, a password and a valid email address as a login. Therefore, at a minimum, we may
    require such necessary information in order to establish your account with us.</p>

<h4>2. What information does Demio, INC gather/track and how is it used?</h4>

<p>PERSONAL INFORMATION: We collect personal information from users including (at minimum) first and last names, an
    email address to be used as a login, billing contact information, credit card number and a password. Your email
    address may be used to send you periodic product newsletters, offers and usage tips from Demio, INC . You can opt
    out of promotional emails at any time, but will still receive communications such as receipts, confirmation emails
    and customer service updates that are considered necessary to provide the service to you. We use the information
    collected to deliver services, process payments, update our records, communicate with you about products and
    services, and generally maintain your accounts with us. We will retain your information for as long as your account
    is active, as needed to provide you services, to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce
    our agreements. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you
    services contact us at support@demio.com . We do not share, sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third
    parties except as described in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Information gathered at either http://demio.com is done so on a voluntary basis. You need not provide us with any
    personal information to use these sites. Information submitted on these sites can include contact information such
    as email addresses, comments on blog postings and job and press inquires. You should be aware that any information
    you provide in the comment or blog areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request
    removal of your personal information from these areas, contact us at support@demio.com . In some cases, we may not
    be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and
    why.</p>
<p>In-session information collected during meeting, webinar and training sessions is protected by the use of end-to-end
    encryption and only accessible by the authorized users, organizers and participants. “In-session information”
    includes all screen sharing data, keyboard/mouse control data and text chat information. This information is never
    exposed in unencrypted form while temporarily resident within Demio, INC’s communication infrastructure servers or
    during transmission across public or private networks. Information about scheduled and prior meetings, webinars
    and/or trainings is stored on our website and is available to our customers and their authenticated users that have
    received an invitation from the organizer via email, instant message, phone or other communication method.</p>
<p>Because of our commitment to present the best possible product to all our users, we track the category of services
    selected by our individual users as well as all information pertaining to user satisfaction. To ensure the quality
    of our product, we reserve the right to maintain evaluation and feedback records.</p>

    We will not view Business Information except as necessary to appropriately support the service or as required by
    law. (Business Information includes schedules, attendee lists, subject names, email addresses, names, session
    records, and any other business information used while in session) When an attendee registers with one of our
    customers for an online meeting, webinar or training, that information is provided to the organizer of the session.
    Demio, INC may store that information to fulfill our obligation to our customers, but we will not use the
    information to send marketing communications for Demio, INC services or third party offers to attendees. You should
    be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit while in session and utilizing the chat feature can
    be read, collected or used by the meeting organizer and other meeting participants. Chat logs and meeting recordings
    are not stored or viewable by Demio, INC and are only available locally to meeting coordinators and moderators. We
    will not view business information, except as necessary to appropriately support the service and for the purpose of
    anticipating, diagnosing, supporting or resolving any problems that might limit or disrupt the quality of our
    customers’ service experience or as required by law.</p>
<p>PARTNERS: In some cases we provide services or sell product lines jointly with other businesses. For these co-branded
    offerings in which a third party is involved in your transactions, we will sometimes share or jointly collect
    customer information related to those transactions with that third party. On the co-branded registration pages we
    will state who is collecting or receiving the information and whose privacy statement governs its use so that you
    will know at the time you create your account exactly how your information will be used. If you are registered with
    Demio, INC through a partnership and you request to opt out of receiving promotional updates, in order to comply
    with the provisions in the Can Spam Act, we will also provide your email address to that partner so that they may
    also discontinue sending you messages on behalf of Demio, INC .</p>

    subsidiaries and affiliated divisions of our parent company entity. Sharing this information helps us make your
