<h3 class="bodytitle">Collection of Personal Data</h3><br>
<div>
<p class="bodytext">You may provide us with your Personal Data in order to receive information, advice, or services from us. We may request personal information about you such as your name, postal address, email address, telephone numbers and we may ask for information which enables us to provide a personalised service to you. The information you give us is either manually or electronically stored in our databases.</p>

<p class="bodytext">If you register with us, you will share some personal information, such as your name, address, date of birth and e-mail address. You do not have to be a registered user to visit the website. But, you will have to register if you want to upload images, interact with the website or make full use of our services. Once you register, you will have an account with Demotix and a password to access that account. You may never use another person's account without permission and you may not use anyone else's password. You should keep your registration current and complete. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password. Please also let us know if there is any unauthorized use of your account or password. We recommend that you always log out from your account at the end of a session with us to prevent other people from accessing your account without your permission. You represent and warrant that all the information you provide in your public profile and user account is accurate and complete. You are solely responsible for any activity occurring on your user account.</p>

<p class="bodytext">We sometimes supplement the information that you provide with information that is received from third parties. For instance, if inaccurate post codes are received, we will use third party software to fix them. </p>

<p class="bodytext">We also reserve the right to monitor and/or record your communication with us by mail, voice, email or any other form of transmission for the purposes of quality control, security and other business needs. Any Personal Data contained in such recorded information will be processed in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p class="bodytext">We may also receive your Personal Data from other members of the Demotix Ltd Group, our service providers, agents, advisers or business partners, including, without limitation, news agencies. Where Personal Data is disclosed to us by third parties, it is the obligation of the disclosing party to ensure such Personal Data is disclosed with requisite authority and consent and we will process such Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

Providing additional information about yourself beyond what is minimally required at registration is entirely up to you. Any information you provide at registration or in your profile section may be used by us as described our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.  You can review the personal information you provide to us and make any desired changes to the information you publish, or to the settings for your account including your email and contact preferences, at any time by logging in to your account on the website.

<h3 class="bodytitle">Publically Accessible Information</h3><br>

You should exercise caution if you choose to disclose personally identifiable information in a publicly accessible area. Remember that this information may remain indefinitely in the publicly accessible area of the website. Also, other users may also be able to view two or more of your individual postings collectively.

<h3 class="bodytitle">Anonymous data collected through this website</h3><br>
<div>

<p class="bodytext">In addition to the information we collect as described above, we use technology to collect anonymous information about the use of our website. For example, we use technology to track which pages of our website our visitors view. We also use technology to determine which Web browsers our visitors use.

<h3 class="bodytitle">Cookies</h3><br>
<div>

<p class="bodytext">In order to collect the anonymous data described in the preceding paragraph, we may use temporary “cookies” that remain in the cookies file of your browser until the browser is closed. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. A cookie is a small piece of information which is sent to your browser and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. This enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not. We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your computer on a network, or in this case, the Internet. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information, such as determining how many of our visitors are from outside of the UK. We may also perform IP lookups to determine which domain you are coming from (i.e: aol.com, yourcompany.com) to more accurately gauge our users' demographics.</p>

<h3 class="bodytitle">Disclosure of your Personal Data</h3><br>
<div>

<ul class="bodylist">
<li>Personal Data may occasionally be transferred to third parties who act for us for further processing in accordance with the purposes for which the data was originally collected or for purposes to which you have consented or otherwise in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For example, sometimes a third party may have access to your Personal Data in order to support our information technology or to handle mailings on our behalf.</li>

<li>We will provide your information to third party companies to perform services on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, e-mail delivery, hosting services and customer service. We direct all such third party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed to them and to not use your information for any purpose other than to provide services on our behalf. Please note that payments made by third party payment providers may also be subject to additional policies.</li>

<li>Unless you have given us your consent to the processing of your Personal Data in accordance with our Privacy Policy (which includes sharing or other disclosing), we will not share or disclose your Personal Data to any unrelated third parties for their own marketing purposes.</li>

<li>We may share or transfer the information in our databases to comply with a legal or regulatory requirement, for the administration of justice, interacting with anti-fraud databases, to protect your vital interests, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or this website, to take precautions against legal liability, or in the event of our sale, merger, reorganisation, transfer of business, dissolution or similar event.</li>

<li>If we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your Personal Data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.</li>

<h3 class="bodytitle">Data Integrity and Security</h3><br>
<div>

<p class="bodytext">We strive to maintain the reliability, accuracy, completeness and currency of Personal Data in our databases and to protect the privacy and security of our databases. The security measures in place on our website and computer systems, aim to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of the information you provide to us. We keep your Personal Data only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or regulatory requirements, or our data retention policy.</p>

<p class="bodytext">We use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") authentication to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive information, in this instance, the tax identification number you may provide on our registration page. SSL authentication and encryption of the information that you send to us over the Internet help protect such online information from third party interception.</p> 

<p class="bodytext">We urge you to protect your own privacy. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone or share your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Unfortunately, despite all of our efforts, there is always a risk that third parties may unlawfully intercept transmissions. For example, we cannot ensure the security of your data during transmission to us or the security of your data on an iPhone, Android (or other telephone device that can use phone applications) or on another computer. This reality is true of all Internet or data transmission use. As a result, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit, and you transmit all information at your own risk. </p>
