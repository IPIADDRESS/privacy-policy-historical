        <p><strong>Notice</strong></p>
        
        <p><em><u>How Personal Information is Collected</u></em></p>

        <p><u>Web Visitors</u> <br>
        On our Corporate Sites, we collect the    following personally identifiable information ("PII") from prospective    clients, prospective business partners, and job applicants: Name, email,    phone number and address. We only collect this information for the purpose of    contacting individuals who have identified themselves as prospects or applicants    for our activities, services and job openings.&nbsp; However, we do share this information with    third party service providers for email processing and related services. These third parties are prohibited    from using your PII for any other purpose. </p>
      
      <p><u>Web Site / Cookies</u><br>
        In order to improve the content and format of our site, Demandware uses Web    site tracking software to automatically capture technical information that is    then stored in our servers' log files. This information may include, but is    not limited to, user domain, the type of Internet browser being used, which    of our Web pages is visited, and the amount of time spent on our site.</p>
        
        <p>In addition, some of Demandware's Web pages may contain "cookies."    A cookie is a small amount of data which our Web site stores on your    computer, and which we can later retrieve. The cookie cannot be read by a    site other than ours. We use cookies for a number of administrative purposes;    for example, to store your preferences for certain kinds of information. Our cookies are tied to PII to    store your information and make it easier for you to use our site. We will not use the PII tied to our cookies to contact you    directly. You can monitor our use of cookies on your computer by setting your    Web browser to inform you when cookies are set, or you can prevent the    cookies from being set entirely. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most    browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies,    how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to    disable cookies altogether. Please understand that if you disable the use of    cookies on your computer, you may be unable to access certain portions or    services in our applications and those of our customers.</p>

      <p>Certain contracted third-parties    use cookies and clear GIFs on our sites, which allow them to recognize a    user's cookie when a user visits our sites. The information that these third-parties    collect and share through this technology is only collected in the aggregate    and not personally identifiable.&nbsp; We    have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement    covers the use of cookies by Demandware only and does not cover the use of    cookies by any advertisers.</p>

          <p><strong>Choice</strong></p>
          
          <p><em><u>Use of Your Personal Information</u></em><br>
        We use your Personal Information to provide you with information about    Demandware and its products and services, including but not limited to    webinars, newsletters, and job openings. You have the option to opt-out    of any secondary communications such as promotional communications by    clicking on "unsubscribe", "profile center", or "unsubscribe" on the bottom    of any promotional emails. </p>
        
      <p>We do not share, sell, rent or trade your Personal Information    to third parties for promotional purposes. However, we may disclose your    Personal Information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith    believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with    legal process including court orders or subpoenas; (2) protect and defend our    rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our    Web sites or eCommerce Services; or (4) protect the personal safety or    property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if    you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information    about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions). </p>
 
        <p>Other than as stated in this Privacy Policy, we will endeavor not to release    your Personal Information to unknown or unaffiliated third parties, and we    will not cross-reference your Personal Information with that of any other    customer or entity.</p>

        <p>To protect your privacy and security, we also take reasonable steps to verify    your identity, before granting access to your Personal Information. In    addition, we may limit or deny access to Personal Information where providing    such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive in the    circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor Framework. We    will respond to your request for access to your Personal Information within    30 days of the original request.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
        
        <p>To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and    to allow only the appropriate use of your Personal Information, we utilize    industry standard physical, technical, and administrative controls and    procedures to safeguard the information we collect.</p>
        <p><strong>Testimonials</strong> </p>
      <p>We will on occasion post customer testimonials    on our Corporate Sites. We place the testimonials here for the benefit of our    prospective clients in order to provide them with feedback from our previous    clients for marketing purposes. We receive expressed consent from the    individuals whose Personal Information is posted along with the testimonials    before it is posted to our Web sites.</p>
      <p><strong>Blogs, Forums and Directories</strong></p>
      <p>We provide the Demandware Forums and Blogs as    a means for our customers and other users of our Web sites and eCommerce    Services to communicate.

      <p><strong>Tell a Friend Feature</strong></p>
      <p>If you    choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about a job, we will ask    you for your friend's name and email address.&nbsp;    We will automatically send your friend a one-time email with    information about this job posting.&nbsp;    Demandware does not store this information.</p>

          <p><strong>Data Integrity</strong></p>
          
        <p>As set forth above, Demandware will take reasonable steps to ensure that    Personal Information is accurate, complete, and current to its intended use.

      <p><strong>Changes to This    Privacy Policy</strong></p>
      
        <p>The practices described in this Privacy Policy are the current Personal    Information protection policies as of April 17, 2009. &nbsp;Demandware, Inc. reserves the right to    modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time consistent with the    requirements of the Safe Harbor Framework. If we decide to change our    practices regarding what PII we collect, how we use it, and under what    circumstances, if any, we disclose it, we will post a prominent notice on our    Corporate Sites 30 calendar days prior to implementing the change. </p>
      <p><strong>Demandware eCommerce    Services</strong> </p>
      <p>Demandware provides our customers with a    hosted eCommerce platform and application suite of services that facilitate    functionality to support the development and management of an eCommerce    website. The platform and application suite is not a part of our corporate    web site. Demandware serves as a Data Processor for our customers who use    these services. More specifically, Demandware does not own the information    that is submitted to customer websites. The information that is submitted to    our customers' websites will be subject to our customers' privacy policy. The    following information discloses how information is submitted to these    websites and how Demandware will handle the information for our customers who    are the owners of this data. <br></p>

          <p><u>Web Visitors (eCommerce Customers)</u><br>
        Demandware processes Personal Information about a visitor to our customers'    website ("Visitors") only when the Visitor chooses to provide such    information. On certain pages, for example, a Visitor may be required to    provide his/her personal information such as his/her name, address, phone    number and e-mail address in order to complete a transaction or perform a    requested service.</p>
        
        <p><u>Employees</u><br>
        Demandware employees may process Personal Information from our customers'    employees for, among other things, application access and authentication. </p>

        <p><strong>Onward    Transfer</strong></p>
        
        <p><em><u>Sharing of Visitors' Personal Information</u></em><br>
        As part of Demandware's services we may contract with third-party providers    to perform certain functions on behalf of our customers to enhance our    existing product and service offerings. Examples include providing product    and service support.</p>
      <p>These    third parties may have access to Visitors' Personal Information only to the    extent necessary to permit them to do their jobs, however, they are bound by    confidentiality agreements or similar contractual restrictions before any    information is provided to them, and they are restricted from using the    information for other purposes.</p>
      <p><u>Web    Site / Cookies</u><br>
        In order to improve the content and format of our platform and applications, our    eCommerce Services use Web site tracking software to automatically capture    technical information that is then stored in our servers' log files. This    information may include, but is not limited to, user domain, the type of Internet    browser being used, which of our customers' Web pages are visited, and the    amount of time spent on our customers' sites.</p>
        
        <p>Our customers' website pages may contain "cookies." A cookie is a    small amount of data which a Web site stores on a Visitor's computer, and    which we or our customers can later retrieve. The cookie cannot be read by a    site other than our customer's. We and our customers use cookies for a number    of administrative purposes; for example, to store Visitors' preferences for    certain kinds of information. We will not write to any cookie information    that will allow anyone to contact Visitor's via telephone, e-mail, or any    other means. Any additional use of cookies by our customers will be governed    by our customers' privacy policies.&nbsp;    Visitors can monitor use of cookies on their computers by setting    their Web browser to inform them when cookies are set, or Visitors can    prevent the cookies from being set entirely. The "help" portion of the    toolbar on most browsers explains how to prevent the browser from accepting    new cookies, how to have the browser provide notice when a new cookie is    received, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please understand that if a    Visitor disables the use of cookies, the Visitor may be unable to access    certain portions or services in our applications or those of our customers.</p>
       
        <p><strong>Security</strong> <br>
        To    protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Visitors'    Personal Information that is processed by our services, Demandware utilizes a    variety of industry standard physical and logical access controls, firewalls,    intrusion detection/prevention systems, network and database monitoring, and    backup systems. We use encrypted sessions when processing or transferring    sensitive data through platform and applications.</p>
        
        <p>We limit access to Visitors' Personal Information and data to    those persons who have a specific business purpose for maintaining and    processing such information. Demandware employees who have been granted    physical access to a Visitor's Personal Information will be made aware of    their responsibilities to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and    availability of that information and have been provided training and    instruction on how to do so. </p>
        <p><strong>Access</strong> <br>
        Demandware will    support our customers in taking reasonable steps to ensure that Visitor's    Personal Information is accurate, complete, and current to its intended use.    We provide our customers with reasonable access to the Personal Information    that they provide to us, as well as the ability to review and correct such    information. </p>
        <p><strong>Links to    Non-Demandware Web Sites and Third Parties</strong></p>
        
        <p>Demandware Customer Web sites may contain links to third-party sites for    Visitors' convenience and/or information. If a Visitor accesses those links,    he/she will leave the Demandware customer's website and be re-directed to a    third-party site. Demandware does not control those sites or the privacy    practices of those third-party sites, which may differ from Demandware's    privacy practices and those of our customer. We do not endorse or make any representations    about third-party Web sites, and the personal data Visitors choose to provide    to third-party Web sites is not covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage    Visitors to review the privacy policy of any Web site or company before    submitting their Personal Information to them.</p>
