On our Corporate Sites, we may collect the following Personal Information from prospective clients, prospective business partners, and job applicants: name, email, phone number and address.

Our cookies are tied to Personal Information to store your information and make it easier for you to use our site. We will not use the Personal Information tied to our cookies to contact you directly. You can monitor our use of cookies on your computer by setting your Web browser to inform you when cookies are set, or you can prevent the cookies from being set entirely. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please understand that if you disable the use of cookies on your computer, you may be unable to access certain portions or services in our applications and those of our customers.</p>

<p>Certain contracted third-parties use cookies and clear graphics interchange formats (GIFs) on our sites, which allow them to recognize a user's cookie when a user visits our sites. The information that these third parties collect and share through this technology is only collected in the aggregate and not personally identifiable. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Demandware only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.</p>

<p>We may partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.&nbsp; Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.&nbsp; If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Here</a>.&nbsp; Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.&nbsp; You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

<p>Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button, Tweet button, and other Widgets which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>

<p><strong>Choice</strong><br>
<u><em>Use of Your Personal Information</em></u><br>
We use your Personal Information to provide you with information about Demandware and its products and services, including but not limited to webinars, newsletters, and job openings. You have the option to opt-out of any secondary communications such as promotional communications by clicking on "unsubscribe" on the bottom of any promotional emails.</p>

<p>We do not share, sell, rent or trade your Personal Information to third parties for promotional purposes. However, we may disclose your Personal Information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process including court orders or subpoenas; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web sites or eCommerce Services; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions).</p>

<p>We may also disclose your personal information if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets. We will notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>

<p>Other than as stated in this Privacy Policy, we will endeavor not to release your Personal Information to unknown or unaffiliated third parties, and we will not cross-reference your Personal Information with that of any other customer or entity.</p>

<p><strong>Links to Non-Demandware Web Sites and Third Parties</strong></p>

<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
We utilize industry standard physical, technical, and administrative controls and procedures to safeguard the information we collect, to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to allow only the appropriate use of your Personal Information.

<p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>The practices described in this Privacy Policy are the current Personal Information protection policies as of March 3, 2014. Demandware, Inc. reserves the right to modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy that we believe to be material regarding our collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information, we will endeavor to post a prominent notice on our Corporate Sites at least thirty (30) days prior to our implementation of such material changes.</p>

<p><strong>DEMANDWARE COMMERCE SERVICES</strong></p>

<p>Demandware provides our customers with a hosted eCommerce platform and application suite of services that facilitate functionality to support the development and management of eCommerce services. The eCommerce services are not a part of our corporate web site. Demandware serves as a Data Processor for our customers who use these services. More specifically, Demandware does not own the information that is submitted to our customers' websites. The information that is submitted to a Web site of one of our customers will be subject to that customer's privacy policy. The following information discloses how information is submitted to these websites and how Demandware will handle the information for our customers who are the owners of this data.</p>

<p><u>Web Visitors (eCommerce Customers)</u><br>
Demandware processes Personal Information about a visitor to our customers' websites ("Visitors") only when the Visitor chooses to provide such information. On certain pages, for example, a Visitor may be required to provide his/her personal information such as his/her name, address, phone number and e-mail address in order to complete a transaction or perform a requested service.</p>

<p><u>Employees</u><br>
Demandware employees may process Personal Information from our customers' employees for, among other things, application access and authentication.</p>

<p><strong>Onward Transfer</strong><br>
<u><em>Sharing of Visitors' Personal Information</em></u><br>
We may contract with third-party providers to perform certain functions on behalf of our customers to enhance our existing product and service offerings, such as product and service support.</p>

<p>These third parties may have access to Visitors' Personal Information as necessary to permit them to perform their functions. They are bound by confidentiality agreements or similar contractual restrictions with respect to any information that is provided to them and they are prohibited from using the information for other purposes.</p>

<p><u>Web Site / Cookies</u><br>
In order to improve the content and format of our platform and applications, our eCommerce Services use Web site tracking software to automatically capture technical information that is then stored in our servers' log files. This information may include, but is not limited to, user domain, the type of Internet browser being used, which of our customers' Web pages are visited, and the amount of time spent on our customers' sites.</p>

<p>Our customers' website pages may contain "cookies." A cookie is a small amount of data which a Web site stores on a Visitor's computer, and which we or our customers can later retrieve. The cookie cannot be read by a site other than ours or our customer's. We and our customers use cookies for a number of administrative purposes, such as to store Visitors' preferences for certain kinds of information. Any use of cookies by our customers will be governed by our customers' privacy policies. Visitors can monitor use of cookies on their computers by setting their Web browser to inform them when cookies are set, or Visitors can prevent the cookies from being set entirely. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers explains how to prevent the browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser provide notice when a new cookie is received, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please understand that if a Visitor disables the use of cookies, the Visitor may be unable to access certain portions or services in our applications or those of our customers.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Visitors' Personal Information that is processed by our services, Demandware utilizes a variety of industry standard physical and logical access controls, firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, network and database monitoring, and backup systems. We use SSL encrypted sessions when processing or transferring sensitive data through platform and applications.</p>

<p>We limit access to Visitors' Personal Information and data to those persons who have a specific business purpose for maintaining and processing such information. Demandware employees who have been granted physical access to a Visitor's Personal Information have been made aware of their responsibilities to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that information and have been provided training and instruction on how to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Access</strong><br>
Demandware will support our customers in taking reasonable steps to ensure that Visitor's Personal Information is accurate, complete, and current to its intended use. We provide our customers with reasonable access to the Personal Information that they provide to us, as well as the ability to review, correct or request the deletion of such information.</p>

<p><strong>Data Retention</strong></p>

<p>We and our customers may retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services and as otherwise set forth in our respective customer's privacy policy. We and our customers may retain and use your information as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our rights and as otherwise set forth in our respective customer's privacy policy.</p>

<p><strong>Links to Non-Demandware Web Sites and Third Parties</strong></p>

<p>Demandware Customer Web sites may contain links to third-party sites for Visitors' convenience and/or information.
