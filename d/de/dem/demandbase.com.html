        <h3>This policy describes how Demandbase uses and protects your personal information.</h3>
        <p><strong>Scope</strong><br>
          This privacy policy describes how we  handle the personal information that you supply to us or concerning your use of  our services available through the <a href="http://www.demandbase.com/" target="_top">www.demandbase.com</a> web site (the “Site”) and applies generally to any affiliated web sites.&nbsp; By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User  Agreement in registration, you expressly consent to our collection, storage,  use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy  Policy.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is effective on  August 1, 2006 for any current users, and upon acceptance for all new users. </p>
        <p><strong>Collection </strong><br>
          You can browse the Site without telling  us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.&nbsp; Once you give us your personal information,  you are not anonymous to us.&nbsp; If you  choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and  storage of that information to our servers located in the United States.<br>
          We may collect and store the following  personal information: </p>
        <ul style="font-size: 12px;">
          <li>email address, physical contact information, and       (depending on the service used) sometimes financial information, such as       credit card; </li>
          <li>transactional information based on your activities on       the Site (such as purchases you make, purchase content, and searches       conducted, all as they relate to your account or purchases);</li>
          <li>billing and other information you provide; </li>
          <li>correspondence through the Site, and correspondence       sent to us; </li>
          <li>computer sign-on data, statistics on page views,       traffic to and from the Site, and ad data, other information, including IP       address and standard web log information; and supplemental information       from third parties. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Marketing </strong><br>
          We don’t sell or rent the personal  information we collect from your using our Site to third parties for their  marketing purposes without your explicit consent.&nbsp; We may combine your information with  information we collect from other companies (such as demographic data) to  improve and personalize our services.&nbsp; If  you don't wish to receive marketing communications from us, simply  “unsubscribe” located at the end of any marketing communication.</p>
        <p><strong>Use of  Information</strong><br>
          Our primary purpose in collecting  personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and  customized experience.&nbsp; You agree that we  may use your personal information to: </p>
        <ul style="font-size: 12px;">
          <li>provide the services and customer support you request; </li>
          <li>resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot       problems; </li>
          <li>prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities,       and enforce our User Agreement; </li>
          <li>customize, measure, and improve our services and the       Site’s content and layout; </li>
          <li>share service updates, and promotional offers based on       your communication preferences;</li>
          <li>Our Disclosure of Your Information </li>
          <li>We may disclose personal information to respond to       legal requirements, enforce our policies, or protect anyone’s rights,       property, or safety. </li>
          <li>We may also share your personal information with: </li>
          <li>Employees and agents of Demandbase in order to help       detect and prevent potentially illegal acts; </li>
          <li>service providers under contract who help with our       business operations; </li>
          <li>other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to       send your information; </li>
          <li>those serving apparently valid subpoenas;</li>
          <li>other business entities, should we plan to merge with,       or be acquired by that business entity. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Without limiting the above, in an  effort to respect your privacy we will not otherwise disclose your personal  information except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of  information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or  to report suspected illegal activity.</p>
        <p><strong>Cookies </strong><br>
We use                                        “cookies" (small files placed on your hard drive) on certain pages of the  Site to help analyze our web page flow, customize our services, measure  promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety.&nbsp; We use cookies to provide services to you.<br>
          A few important things you should know  about cookies are that: </p>
        <ul style="font-size: 12px;">
          <li>We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your       signed-in status. </li>
          <li>Most cookies are “session cookies,” meaning that they       are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. </li>
          <li>You are always free to decline our cookies if your       browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of the       Site. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cookies allow: </p>
        <ul style="font-size: 12px;">
          <li>You to enter your password less frequently during your       use of our Site.&nbsp; </li>
          <li>Us to provide information that is targeted to your       interests.&nbsp; </li>
          <li>Us to promote and enforce trust and safety.&nbsp; </li>
          <li>Us to offer certain features that are only available       through the use of cookies.&nbsp; </li>
          <li>Us to measure promotional effectiveness.&nbsp; </li>
          <li>Us to analyze our Web page flow.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are always free to decline cookies  if your browser permits.&nbsp; However, if you  decline cookies, you may not be able to use certain features on the Site, and  you may be required to reenter your password more frequently while using the  Site.</p>
        <p><strong>Account  Protection </strong><br>
          Your password is the key to your  account.&nbsp; Use unique numbers, letters,  and special characters and do not disclose your Demandbase password to  anyone.&nbsp; If you do share your password or  your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for  all actions taken in the name of your account.&nbsp;  If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control  over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions  taken on your behalf.&nbsp; Therefore, if your  password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify us  and change your password. </p>
        <p><strong>Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information </strong><br>
          You can see, review and change most of  your personal information by logging into the Site.&nbsp; Generally, we will not manually modify your  personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity  remotely.&nbsp; You must promptly update your  personal information if it changes or is inaccurate.&nbsp; Upon your request, we will close your account  and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible,  based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law.&nbsp; We do retain personal information from closed  accounts in order to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed,  resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations,  enforce our User Agreement, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.</p>
        <p><strong>Security </strong><br>
          Your information is stored on our  servers located in the United    States.&nbsp;  We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use certain tools  (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal  information against unauthorized access and disclosure.&nbsp; However, as you probably know, third parties  may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private  communications.&nbsp; Therefore, although we  work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not  expect, that your personal information or private communications will always  remain private. </p>
        <p><strong>Phishing</strong><br>
          In order to protect yourself from email  that appears to be from Demandbase, but may be from a disreputable third party,  you should never provide any personal information directly in response to an  email you believe you have received from us.&nbsp;  Rather, you should always close any such email, open your browser, log directly  in to the Demandbase Site and change, update or modify any such personal  information only using our Site.&nbsp; In the  event that you believe that you have received a request for personal  information in an email message that is made to appear that it was sent by us,  please inform us immediately. </p>
        <p><strong>General </strong><br>
          We may amend this Privacy Policy at any  time by posting the amended terms on the Site.&nbsp;  All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are  initially posted on the Site.</p>
