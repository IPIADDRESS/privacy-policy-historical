<p>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some
    web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites and other
    online services with which a user communicates. There is no industry standard
    that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these
    signals. UMG currently does not take action in response to these signals. </p>

<p><strong>LINKS TO
    THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</strong></p>

<p>Our Site, our newsletters and other
    communications may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites
    of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to
    any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy
    policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these
    policies. </p>

<p><strong>CHANGES
    TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>

<p>Any material changes we may make to our privacy
    policy in the future will be posted on this page prior to the change becoming
    effective and/or we will notify you through the Site or, where appropriate, by
    e-mail. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our
    privacy policy. </p>

<p><strong>USERS OF SITES IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA</strong></p>

<p>This section of this Privacy Policy applies only
    if you use the Site from a country that is a Member State of the European Economic
    Area, and supplements the information in this Privacy Policy. </p>

<p><b>Legal Basis for Data Processing</b>: We process personal data for the purposes set out in this Privacy
    Policy, as described above. Our legal basis to process personal data includes
    processing that is: necessary for the performance of the contract between you
    and us (for example, to provide you with the services you request and to
    identify and authenticate you so you may use the Site); necessary to comply
    with legal requirements (for example, to comply with applicable accounting
    rules and to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement); necessary for our
    legitimate interests (for example, to manage our relationship with you and to
    improve the Site); and based on consent by our customers (for example, to
    communicate with you about our products and services and provide you with
    marketing information), which may subsequently be withdrawn at any time (by using
    preference settings in emails or on our Sites, <a href="http://privacypolicy.umusic.com/email/default.asp" target="blank">using this form</a>,
    or emailing us as set out in the Contact section) without affecting the
    lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>

<p>We may use automated decision making
    technologies, including profiling, to support our data processing activities. Our
    automated decision making capabilities include logic that attempts to identify
    artists, music, communications, products, or offers that we believe may
    interest you. By using this logic, it helps us personalize your interactions
    with UMG and UMG artists. For you, this means that you may see online
    advertisements, direct marketing communications (if you have subscribed), or
    other advertising or marketing messages or special offers based on your
    activity on our Sites or interactions with UMG Companies or our third party
    partners. </p>

<p>In some instances, you may be required to
    provide us with personal data for processing as described above, in order for
    us to be able to provide you to use all the features of the Site.</p>

<p><strong>International transfers</strong></p>

<p>Our sharing your personal
    data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, may involve transferring your data
    outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Whenever we transfer your personal
    data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it
    by ensuring, where required by law, at least one of the following safeguards is
    implemented:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;list-style-position: inside;">
    <li>
        transferring personal data to countries that
        have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data
        by the European Commission; </li>

    <li>
        using specific contracts approved by the
        European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in
        Europe; or </li>

    <li>
        transferring personal data to the United States
        to an entity if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to
        provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the
        US.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may be entitled, in accordance with applicable law, to request a
    copy of relevant safeguards by contacting UMG as described in the “Contact
    Section”. </p>

    <b>Purpose of  Cookie</b><br>
    These cookies collect anonymous
    information about how you use our Site, for example which pages you visit

<p>We may use
    cookies:</p>
<div style="margin-left:10px">

        that data to analyse user behaviour across multiple sites; </p>

    <p>(ii) to categorise pools of users (on an anonymised basis)
        based on demographic and/or behavioural data and use this to, (1) target our
        advertising to cookie-ed users on third party websites and Universal Music
        websites, and (2) use that data to allow targeted third party advertising to
        categorised cookie-ed users either in respect of advertising placement UMG has
        bought/placed and targeted to users on behalf of third parties or in respect of
        advertising bought/placed by third parties and targeted to cookie pools UMG has

<p><strong>Web
    Beacons</strong></p>

<p>We, or our
    third party partners, may employ a software technology called web beacons (also
    known as web bugs, clear gifs or pixels) which helps us understand what content
    is effective, for example by counting the number of users who have visited
    these pages, and to understand usage patterns. Web beacons are tiny graphics
    with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to let
    us know when content is viewed. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a
    user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded on web pages, ads, and
    e-mail. We, or our third party partners, may tie the information gathered by
    web beacons to the other information we collect about you. &nbsp;</p>

    to disabling cookies and other tracking technologies as described above, you
