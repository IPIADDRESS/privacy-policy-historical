				<ol class="alist">
					<li>"<b>Personal Information</b>" means information that identifies you, such as your name, address, telephone number or email address;</li>

			</li>

			<h2>Our Principles</h2>

			<li>We are committed to handling responsibly the information and data we collect about you through the Website, whether Personal Information, Potentially Identifying Information or Non-personal Data. We have designed our Privacy Policy in accordance with the following principles (the "<b>Principles</b>"):

				<ol class="alist">
					<li>Privacy policies should be easy to understand, comprehensive, and easy to locate.</li>
					<li>Only the minimum amount of Personal Information reasonably necessary to provide you with services on the Website should be collected and maintained, and only for so long as reasonably needed or required. For simple viewing of the Website, no Personal Information should be collected.  </li>
					<li>Personal Information you provide through the Website should not be used for marketing or advertising purposes without your consent. It should not be disclosed to anyone else without your consent, unless specifically allowed by this Privacy Policy or unless required.</li>
					<li>Potentially Identifying Information may be used to improve the Website and for marketing and advertising purposes, as long as it is not used to identify you.</li>
					<li>Non-Personal Data may be used to improve the Website and for marketing or advertising purposes.</li>
					<li>Unless restricted or prohibited by law, and if your email address has been collected and retained, you should be notified by email when circumstances require us to provide a third party with your Personal Information.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>

			<li>The provisions below are divided into four main categories:
				<ol class="alist">
					<li><b><a href="#personal_information">Personal Information,</a></b></li>
					<li><b><a href="#potentially_identifying_information">Potentially Identifying Information,</a></b></li>
					<li><b><a href="#non_personal_data">Non-Personal Data, and</a></b></li>
					<li><b><a href="#other_provisions">Other Provisions.</a></b></li>
				</ol>
				<p>These provisions set out specific details about how we handle your Collected Data, in keeping with the Principles. If a situation arises that is not covered by the specific provisions below, then we use the Principles to guide us in dealing with that situation.</p>

			<h2>D. Other Provisions</h2>
			<h3>Security of Personal Information Collected</h3>

			<li>We have implemented reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access to Collected Data that we store and control. However, no website can fully eliminate security risks.

We will post a reasonably prominent notice to the Website if any such security breach occurs.</li>

			<h3>Acquisition or Similar Transaction</h3>

			<li>We may transfer some or all of the Collected Data to a third party as a result of an acquisition, reorganization or similar transaction. Upon such transfer, the acquirer's privacy policy will apply. In such event, we will use reasonable efforts to:

				</ol>
			</li>

			<h3>Children</h3>

			<li>The Website is not directed at children under the age of 13. We will never knowingly request Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13 without requiring parental consent.

			<h3>Third-Party Websites</h3>

			<h3>Note to International Users</h3>

			<li>The Website is hosted in the United States of America (the "<b>Hosting Location</b>"). If you are accessing the Website from another country, note that you are transferring your Collected Data to the Hosting Location, which may have different data protection laws than your country.

					<li>the transfer of your Collected Data to the Hosting Location.</li>
