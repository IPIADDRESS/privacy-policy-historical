<h2>Deluxe Corporation Privacy and Information Practices</h2>
<p>Deluxe's privacy policies reflect our commitment to respond to the changing needs and concerns of consumers, financial services companies, and regulators. Most importantly, Deluxe is committed to maintaining the high standards and reputation for privacy and the trust we have earned since our formation in 1915.</p>
<p>Deluxe Corporation owns several businesses. Each business serves customers who have specific and unique privacy concerns, and each business segment has implemented a privacy policy that reflects the applicable legal requirements and customer expectations for that business.</p>

</p>
<h2>Privacy Fundamentals: Privacy Matters at Deluxe </h2>
<p>Long before laws that protect the privacy of certain kinds of information and long before terms like "identity theft" were commonly known, Deluxe Corporation was a trusted custodian of sensitive customer information. For decades, financial institutions and customers have relied on Deluxe as a caretaker of information such as checking account numbers, routing numbers, addresses, credit card numbers, telephone numbers, social security numbers, drivers' license numbers and many other pieces of information considered confidential.</p>
<p>Today that information is known as non-public personal information and it is the center of attention for financial institutions and businesses, like Deluxe that deal with this type of information on a daily basis. Under laws known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, data security and breach regulations, non-public personal information must be protected. At Deluxe, we've been protecting this kind of information since the company was founded in 1915. </p>
<p>Our business depends on our ability to meet the privacy needs of the industry and of the people who use Deluxe products for financial transactions every day. No matter where an employee works at Deluxe, privacy matters.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manufacturing</strong> — Every day thousands of checks and related product orders are fulfilled. Each order has confidential information included, so Deluxe focuses on making sure that information is secure, and appropriately disposed of, when necessary</li>
<li><strong>Customer Care</strong> — Our associates interact with our clients and customers every day. We take steps to ensure that all points of contact including phone, e-mail, electronic, or standard mail are secure, and confidential information is used and handled according to company policy and applicable law.</li>
<li><strong>Sales &amp; Marketing</strong> — Deluxe has established procedures to ensure that each employee knows how to handle and protect confidential information. Deluxe takes responsibility to follow industry guidelines for privacy protection practices, ensure accuracy in direct marketing, and meet customer preferences regarding the collection and usage of confidential information</li>
<li><strong>Corporate</strong> — Whether it's resolving a problem or managing a client relationship, corporate employees have the training and tools to recognize confidential information and how to make sure it is secure, and remains confidential</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deluxe's commitment to Privacy </h2>
<p>Throughout our existence, Deluxe Corporation ("Deluxe") has been a trusted custodian of sensitive consumer data. Financial services companies and consumers rely on that trust. The operating subsidiaries of Deluxe created a formal privacy policy in 1997 to ensure that the clients and customers of Deluxe understand our commitment to protecting customer privacy.</p>
<p>It's good business practice for companies today to be clear about how they use customer information. Also, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires financial institutions and other businesses to have established privacy policies, readily accessible to customers to understand how their information is collected, used, protected, and shared.</p>
<h2>Privacy Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>Our privacy policies clearly convey how we collect and use customer information within the Deluxe group of businesses</li>

<li>When making sales under a direct to consumer business model, Deluxe provides the options required by law to limit the usage or sharing of their customer information with reputable third parties</li>
<li>When making sales under a direct marketing business to business model, Deluxe honors customer requests to not have their contact information shared for marketing purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of the business model, each of the Deluxe companies builds its privacy policy and information practices around the following guiding principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: A commitment to use reasonable procedures to ensure that information collected, used, and exchanged will be accurate and complete. </li>

<li><strong>Responsiveness</strong>: A commitment to respond to privacy-related inquiries in a timely and accurate manner. 
</li><li><strong>Employee Education</strong>: A commitment to educate employees regarding information practices and the proper handling and use of information. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Auditing</strong>: A commitment to periodic auditing of internal activities to ensure adherence to established information practices, policies, and procedures. </li>
</ul>

Any changes to the privacy and security policy will be posted on the Web sites for our various business segments so that you are aware of the information we collect, how we use it, as well as the latest updates on how we maintain the secure portions of our Web sites.</p>
<p>Periodically, the operations and business practices of Deluxe Corporation are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies and procedures governing the confidentiality of information.
