			Deluxe Web sites are directed or intended for US residents only. This policy is effective 
			08/31/00 and applies to all consumer identifiable information Deluxe obtains when a consumer visits our Web site(s).
			<p>
			<b>CONSUMER PRIVACY STATEMENT FOR DELUXE CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ("DELUXE")</b>
			<br>
			Protecting privacy is not new to Deluxe Corporation. Deluxe has a long history of recognizing and 
			protecting the privacy of consumers. With the advent of the Internet, Deluxe is committed to 
			protecting your privacy and utilizing technology that gives you the most powerful, safe, on-line experience 
			available. We want to assure you that when Deluxe asks for consumer information, it's done with 
			the goal of improving our relationship. Deluxe and its subsidiaries participate in and comply with the Better Business 
			Bureau's (BBB) Privacy Program. More information on the BBB and their Privacy Program is available at <a href="deluxe.cfm?page=http://www.bbbonline.org">
			www.bbbonline.org</a>. The following statement will help you understand how we collect, use 
			and safeguard information you provide through our Web sites.
			</p><p>
			This policy is effective 08/31/00 and applies to all consumer identifiable information Deluxe obtains 
			when a consumer visits  our Web site(s).
			</p><p>
			<b>Information Collection and Use</b>
			<br>
			When you browse Deluxe's Web sites, you do so without revealing your identity. Personal information is not collected without your awareness. For each visitor to our Web sites, our servers 
			recognize the Web site you came from and the web site you visit when leaving. 

			</p><p>
			In order to manage risk in the order capture process, Deluxe may track the order preferences of visitors 
			to our Web site(s). Information tracked and retained by Deluxe is generic and not individually identifiable.  This is accomplished through cookies...
			</p><p>
			<b>Cookies</b>
			<br>
			Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive.  A cookie may contain information (such as a unique user session ID), that is used to track the pages of the sites you've visited.  We use cookies but do not store personally identifiable information in your cookies.  The Deluxe Personal Check Reordering Site and the Deluxe Business Forms site use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience.   This information helps us serve you better by keeping track of your order as you shop at our sites and it helps us by improving our site design.
			</p><p>
			Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that.  Even without a cookie, you can use the majority of the features within our sites. 
			</p><p>
			<b>Disclosure of Individual Consumer Information</b>
			<br>
			We are committed to protecting your private information.  Deluxe uses the information collected about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience.  Deluxe may also use your information to communicate with you about products, services, and promotions in the future.  For the purposes of check verification and fraud prevention, Deluxe will exchange information about our consumers internally and among our affiliates.
			</p><p>
			Names and other consumer information that are received by Deluxe through a bank or credit union are not shared / rented to nonaffiliated third parties except for the purpose of fulfilling our contracts with FIs or as otherwise permitted by law.
			</p><p>
			Deluxe's direct marketing business, Deluxe Business Forms, Check Unlimited, Designer Checks and Plaid Moon, may selectively rent information they independently obtain such as names, mailing addresses and e-mail addresses to reputable third parties and provide certain information to other companies or organizations whose products or services we think may interest you.  These third parties are carefully screened and are aware of Deluxe's privacy policy.
			</p><p>
			If you do not want the information you provide Deluxe to be shared with nonaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes, or do not want to receive correspondence from Deluxe, you have the choice to opt-out as described below.
			</p><p>
			<b>Identifying Information You Choose to Provide</b>
			<br>
			At times, Deluxe may request that you voluntarily supply personal information for purposes such as 
			correspondence, site registration, making a purchase, participating in an on-line survey or employment opportunities. 
			If you elect to participate, Deluxe may require personally identifiable information, including your name, 
			mailing address, phone number, bank information, credit card information or E-mail address. When you submit personal 
			information to Deluxe you understand and agree that as allowed by contract Deluxe and its subsidiaries may access, 
			store and use your information. Information you provide will be safeguarded to strict standards of security and confidentiality. 
			Because Deluxe recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of the information you choose to provide, 
			we do not share E-mail addresses.
			</p><p>
			<b>Security of Information</b>
			<br>
			Security measures are in place on Deluxe's Web sites to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the 
			information under our control. We offer the industry standard security measures available through your browser. 
			Encrypted information is scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches Deluxe. Information (including 
			E-mail) sent to us might not be secure unless we advise you that security measures will be in place prior to your 
			transmission. Therefore, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as social security or account 
			numbers to us via unsecured E-mail. Such communications should be sent to us by postal mail or phone call.
			</p><p>
			Deluxe requires any vendors or consultants we hire, as well as suppliers and contractors, to observe 
			our Information Practices Policy with respect to security and any of our consumers’ individual consumer information. 
			They must abide by the policies when conducting work for us, and they will be held accountable for their actions.
			</p><p>
			<b>Choice to Opt-Out</b>
			<br>
			Deluxe provides consumers the opportunity to opt-out of (1) unsolicited mail and/or (2) the sharing of 
			information with others. Options available to consumers for removing their information from our database for 
			marketing purposes and not receive future communications or to no longer receive our service are listed below 
			under <b>Contacting Deluxe.</b>
			</p><p>
			<b>Correct/Update/Access</b>

			Deluxe is committed to ensuring that the information we obtain and use about consumers is accurate. You 
			can help us maintain the accuracy of information previously provided or information we may have collected by 
			informing us of changes or modifications through the Contacting Deluxe methods described below. Deluxe’s 
			service representatives are trained to answer consumer questions about, and to give consumers reasonable 
			access to the information we have about them.

			information. They may request information concerning our products and services and attempt to order certain

			procedures governing the confidentiality of information. These reviews are conducted by internal staff, internal 
			auditors who report directly to the Deluxe Board of Directors, external auditing and accounting firms and government regulators. 
			Included in these self-assessments and examinations are reviews of the controls and safeguards related to consumer 
			privacy described in our <a href="deluxe.cfm?page=001-008-A00.htm">Information Practices Policy</a>.
