		<p>Deluxe Corporation owns several businesses. Each business serves customers who have specific and unique privacy concerns, and each business has implemented a privacy policy that reflects the applicable legal requirements and customer expectations for that business. <b>Regardless of the business model, each of the Deluxe companies has built its privacy policy around the following guiding principles:</b></p>

		<p><b>Compliance</b> - A commitment to collect, use, and exchange consumer data in accordance with applicable laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and contractual obligations</p>
		<p><b>Confidentiality</b> - A commitment to collect, use, and exchange information in accordance with appropriate confidentiality standards</p>
		<p><b>Privacy</b> - A commitment to self-regulation in recognition of consumers' expectation of privacy and consistent with leading industry standards </p>

		<p>The following statements will help you understand how Deluxe Financial Services collects, uses, and safeguards the information you provide through our Web sites.</p> 
		<p><b>Information Collection and Use</b>
		<br>When you browse Deluxe Financial Services Web sites, you do so without revealing your identity. Personal information is not collected without your awareness. For each visitor to our Web sites, our servers recognize the Web site you came from and the Web site you visit after you leave. </p>

		<p>Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually set your browser to decline cookies. Even if your Web browser is set to decline cookies, you can use the majority of the features within our sites. </p>
		<p><b>Disclosure of Individual Consumer Information</b><br> 
		Deluxe Financial Services is committed to protecting your private information. We use the information collected about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience.
