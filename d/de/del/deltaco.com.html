          <p>This Privacy Policy was last updated and is effective as of January  26, 2012.<br><br></p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy applies to Del Taco  LLC’s (“Del Taco” “we” “our”) websites (including www.deltaco.com, www.deltacowebstore.com and  www.deltacofranchise.com), interactive features and mobile sites that post a  link to it (collectively “Sites”) whether accessed via personal computers,  mobile devices, tablets or otherwise (collectively, “Device”). This Privacy Policy covers information collected at these websites. It does not cover any information  collected at any other websites, including those maintained by Del Taco  franchisees, or offline by Del Taco (unless specifically stated, such as in our  stores in connection with a consumer promotion).  
          This Privacy Policy explains how Del Taco collects,  uses and shares information when you access or use our Sites.

          <h4>Your California  Privacy Rights</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
      
            <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as “Shine the Light”  Law, allows California  residents to request and obtain from businesses once a year, free of charge,  information about their personal information (if any) a business has disclosed  to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year.  Businesses are not obligated to furnish this  information if they do not share personal information with third parties for  direct marketing purposes without the consumer’s express consent.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Del Taco does not share consumers’ personal information with third  parties for their direct marketing purposes without consumers’ consent.  California residents may request further  information about our approach to this law by writing to our legal department: General Counsel <br>

This Usage  Information may include your browser type, the URL that referred you to our  Sites, and areas within our Sites that you visit, among other information.

When we associate  Usage Information or a Device Identifier with you, we will treat it as  Personally Identifiable Information.  We  may use the following methods, among others, to collect Usage Information:<br><br>
                <ol class="number-list">

We may include web beacons in our web pages and e-mail messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons may be used for a number of purposes, including to count visitors to the Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, and to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened. </li>
              
                  <li type="a"><u><strong>Embedded  Scripts</strong></u><strong>.</strong>  An embedded script is  programming code that is designed to collect information about your  interactions with the Sites, such as the links on which you click.
