              <h4>Your California Privacy Rights</h4>
              <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as “Shine the Light” Law, allows California residents to request and obtain from businesses once a year, free of charge, information about their personal information (if any) a business has disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. Businesses are not obligated to furnish this information if they do not share personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes without the consumer's consent. Del Taco does not share consumers' personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without consumers' consent. California residents may request further information about our approach to this law by writing to our legal department:

We may use Usage Information for many purposes, including to enhance our Sites. We collect your IP address or other unique identifier for your Device used to access the Sites (“Device Identifier”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Sites, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.
