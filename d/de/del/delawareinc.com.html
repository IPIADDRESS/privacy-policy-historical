<p>Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our Website. By accessing or using this Website, you agree to this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time.

If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on this Website or on or through any of its features, register on the Website, make any purchases through the Website, use any of the interactive or public comment features of this Website or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or any screen name or user name you may use.

<u>Personal Information</u></p>

</ul>

<p><u>Other Information</u></p>

	<li>Like many websites, the Harvard website uses cookie&nbsp;technology. When you first connect to our site we identify your browser with a unique, random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about you, except your first name so we can welcome you on your next visit. Cookies help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going&nbsp;and how long they spend there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site even better.</li>
	<li>Information about your internet connection, the equipment you use to access our Website, usage details and your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking). Please contact us if you wish to opt out of behavioral tracking.</li>
</ul>

<p>We collect this information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Directly from you when you provide it to us.</li>
	<li>Automatically as you navigate through the site. Information collected automatically may include usage details, IP addresses and information collected through cookies and other tracking technologies.</li>
</ul>
<span class="subParaTitle"><strong>Why Do We Collect Personal Information</strong></span>

<p>Harvard collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service when you form your company and every year thereafter until you close or cancel your company.</p>

<p>As your Delaware Registered Agent, we are required by law to maintain your Contact Person's address. We will use this information to inform you of future Delaware Franchise Tax due dates and offer to fulfill these services for you for a fee. We will inform you of annual Registered Agent fees due. We will send you any service of process packages we may receive as your Registered Agent. If courier fees are necessary to forward service of process, we will charge you a service fee.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to notify us of any change in address and contact information so we can send you tax compliance notices, Registered Agent invoices and service of process.</p>
<span class="subParaTitle"><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></span>

<p>We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including:</p>

<ul>

	<li>To present our Website and its contents to you.</li>
	<li>To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us.</li>
	<li>To provide you with notices about your account, including expiration and renewal notices.</li>
	<li>To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection.</li>
	<li>To notify you about changes to our Website or any products or services we offer or provide though it.</li>
	<li>To allow you to participate in interactive features on our Website.</li>
	<li>In any other way we may describe when you provide the information.</li>
	<li>The information we collect automatically is statistical data and does not include personal information. It helps us to improve our Website and to deliver a better and more personalized service, including by enabling us to estimate our audience size and usage patterns.</li>
	<li>We may store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Website according to your individual interests, speed up your searches and recognize you when you return to our Website.</li>
</ul>
<span class="subParaTitle"><strong>Disclosure of Your Information</strong></span>

<p>Communication with Harvard through our website is not intended to create an attorney-client relationship. Harvard Business Services, Inc. is not a law firm, and therefore any information transmitted to Harvard is not considered privileged client-attorney information.</p>

<p>At times, we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your information. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure is necessary for the public interest.</p>

<p>We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction.</p>

<p>We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this privacy policy:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business.</li>
	<li>To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of Harvard Business Services, Inc.'s assets, in which personal information held by Harvard Business Services, Inc. about our Website users is among the assets transferred.</li>
	<li>For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.</li>
	<li>To comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.</li>
	<li>To enforce or apply our <a href="/terms-of-use/">terms of use</a> and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes.</li>
	<li>If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of Harvard Business Services, Inc., our customers or others.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><u>Tracking Technologies and Advertising</u></strong><br>
You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this site may then be inaccessible or not function properly.</p>
