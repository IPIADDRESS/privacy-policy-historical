			<ul class="standard-list">
				<li>Affiliated Entities. We may share personally identifiable information with our parent, subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide (collectively, ‚ÄúAffiliated Entities‚Äù) for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including to permit such Affiliated Entities to send you marketing materials.

For instance, if you request a brochure, we may share personally identifiable information about you with fulfillment and management agencies to complete your request.  </li>
				<li>Dealers and Retailers. We may share personally identifiable information with third parties that offer our products for sale.

				<li>Other Disclosures.
