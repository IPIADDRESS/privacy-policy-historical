Our basic policy is that we don't care who you are, but we keep track
of what you do with our machines, and you will be responsible for
anything you ask us to publish on your behalf.

<h2>Advertising</h2>

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit
our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not
including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about
your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide
advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you
would like more information about this practice and to know your
choices about not having this information used by these companies,
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click
here</a>.

<h2>Forms</h2>

This web site makes a reasonable effort to refrain from disclosing
information submitted via forms.  We cannot guarantee that accidents
won't happen.  If you are concerned about privacy and are unwilling to
take the risk, simply do not provide your information.  Private
information is never a requirement for services provided here.

<h2>Browsing</h2>

The mere act of viewing pages on this site will not cause private
information about you to be recorded.  We do, however, record your IP
address, the date and time your browse each page, and the URL of the
page.  We normally do not make this information available to the
public - it is collected to provide statistical information about
server usage, and to plan for future capacity.  We may occasionally
use "cookies" to temporarily identify your session in order to improve
the quality of service we provide, but such cookie use will not cause
any personal information about you to be disclosed to us.

<h2>EMail</h2>

Any information mailed to any of the mailing lists hosted by delorie
software is considered public information and will be archived and
disclosed to the public.  Some services may require an email address
to verify authenticity (for example, services whereby the user submits
information which is maintained by delorie.com, such as the HOWTOs)
and in such cases the email address will be published with the
submitted information, to allow readers to contact the authors.

<h2>Banner Ads</h2>

Banner ads appearing on this site have their own privacy policies
provided by the banner ad agent.  See <a href="http://www.burstmedia.com/privacy.asp">Burst! Media</a>.

<h2>Other</h2>

Send email to <a href="mailto:dj@delorie.com">dj@delorie.com</a> if
you have further questions about this policy.
