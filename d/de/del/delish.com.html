For the purposes of this policy, an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with another entity shall be deemed to be an &quot;Affiliate&quot;, where control means ownership of 15% or more of the voting stock or other ownership interests. For the purposes of this policy, &quot;PersonallyIdentifiable Information&quot; is information that we can use to identify or contact you as an individual, and includes your name, email address, address,telephone number and any other information that we associate with any of the foregoing. By submitting PersonallyIdentifiable Information through any of our Covered Sites, you agree to the terms of this privacy policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with this privacy policy. b. This privacy policy does not apply to information collected about you by anyone except Hearst and only applies to the Covered Sites(defined above).
