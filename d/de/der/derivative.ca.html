<p>Below we have categorized the types of Personal  Information we collect and details about how we use it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) <strong><em>Membership Information</em></strong><u></u></p>

  As a Member, you will be required to provide to  Derivative your Personal Information,  including: first name, last name, user name, password, email address,  organization (if applicable), physical address and country  (collectively, “<strong>Membership  Information</strong>”). Our lawful ground for collecting Membership Information,  including Personal Information, is your express consent. By providing your  Membership Information to us, you acknowledge that you are freely making  that choice and that there is no risk of deception, intimidation, or coercion  if you do not provide such information.<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Your  credit card information will be provided by Derivative to a third party credit  card system for processing and neither Derivative nor such third party will  maintain your credit card information on file after the applicable transaction  has been processed. This means that your credit card information will be used  only to process the transaction for which you provide it. For subsequent  transactions, you will be required to re-enter your credit card information.  Derivative will take appropriate measures to ensure that any third party to  whom Derivative provides access to your credit card information for processing  takes measures to protect the privacy of your Personal Information comparable  to the measures set out in this Policy. <br>

<p><strong>1</strong><strong>0) <u>Legal  Rights (“Right to Object” and “Right to Withdraw Consent”)</u></strong> </p>
<p><br>
  Under some personal information laws, you may have specific rights in  relation to personal information that include the right to  request access, correction, erasure, restriction, transfer, to object to  processing, to portability of data and (where the lawful ground of processing  is consent) to withdraw consent.<br>
  </p>
<p>Some of these options may  be exercised directly as outlined in the “Opt-Out” section. Alternatively, and  to exercise any of the other rights set out above, please email our Privacy  Officer (see “Contact Information” section below).<br>
</p>
<p>If you are not happy with  any aspect of how we collect and use your Personal Information, you also have  the right to object to the applicable privacy commission such as the Office of  the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO),  the UK Supervisory Authority for data  protection issues, or the European Data Protection Supervisor, as appropriate.  We would be grateful if you would contact us first if you do have a complaint  so that we can try to resolve it for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11) <u>Personal  Information Located Outside of Canada</u></strong></p>
<p><br>
  Derivative and its affiliates,  and other third parties to whom we disclose information under this Policy may  perform activities such as data retention or processing outside of Canada. As a  result, your information may be securely used, stored or accessed in other  countries and may be subject to the laws of those countries. For example,  information may be disclosed in response to valid demands or requests from  government authorities, courts, or law enforcement in these countries.</p>
<p><br>
  With respect to users in  the European Economic Area (EEA), we do our best to ensure a similar degree of  security of Personal Information as  the EEA by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is in place:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>We will only transfer or store personal data to       countries that the European Commission have approved as providing an       adequate level of protection for Personal Information; or</li>
  <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may       use specific contracts, codes of conduct, or certification mechanisms       approved by the European Commission which give Personal Information the       same protection it has in Europe; or</li>
  <li>If we use US-based providers that are part of       EU-US Privacy Shield, we may transfer data to them, as they have       equivalent safeguards in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>12) <u>Data  Portability</u></strong> </p>
<p><br>
  Derivative provides the right for anyone whom we have Personal  Information of to receive the Personal Information concerning him/her in a  commonly used and machine readable format. A data subject also has the right to  transmit this data to another “controller”, as defined in the GDPR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>14) <u>Changes  to our Privacy Policy</u></strong></p>
<p><br>
  If we decide to change our Policy, we will post those changes on this page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>15) <u>GDPR  Compliance</u></strong> </p>
<p><br>
  Derivative continues to endeavor to comply with the EU GDPR  framework as set forth by the European Union regarding the collection, use, and retention of  personal data from European Union member countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
