	<h2>Information collected automatically </h2>
	<p>We collect information about your visit to our sites,  including what pages you view, the number of bytes transferred, the links you  click, the materials you access, and other actions taken within Interactive  Medical Media's sites. On sites that you enter with a user ID, we may connect  this information with your identity to determine your potential interests in  our products and services. We also collect certain standard information that  your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your Internet Protocol  (IP) address, your browser type and capabilities and language, your operating  system, the date and time you access the site, and the website from which you linked  to our site. We do not link this information to your identity.</p>

	<p>Medical Media products, registering  purchased products, processing product orders, answering customer service  requests, facilitating use of our websites, and so forth. In order to offer you  a more consistent experience in your interactions with Interactive Medical  Media, information collected by our websites may be combined with information  we collect by other means.</p>
	<p>Website improvement. &nbsp;We may use your personal information to  improve our websites and related Interactive Medical Media products or  services, or to make our websites easier to use by eliminating the need for you  to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing our websites to your  particular preference or interests. <br>
        Communications. With your permission, we may use your  personal information gathered via our websites to inform you of products or  services available from Interactive Medical Media. When collecting information  that might be used to contact you about our products and services, we will  always give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such communications.

        <br>
        Our use of cookies and web beacons<br>
        Cookies are small files that websites save to your hard disk  or to your browser's memory. We may use them to track the number of times you  have visited the site, to track the number of visitors to the site, to  determine and analyze visitors' use of our sites (including the effectiveness  of online advertising), to store information that you provide such as your  preferences, and to store technical information useful for your interactions  with our websites. We may use session cookies (cookies that are deleted when  your browser session ends) to store your user ID, elements of your user  profile, to facilitate your movement around our websites (particularly in  connection with information searches and order placement) and other information  useful in administering the session. You have the ability to accept or decline  cookies. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can  usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies or to notify you when a  cookie is being placed on your computer. If you choose to decline cookies, you  may not be able to fully experience the features of Interactive Medical Media's  websites or other websites that you visit. Our sites also may contain  electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs -  that allow us to count the number of users who have visited those pages. We may  include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or Newsletters in order to  determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. </p>
	
	<h2>Disclosure of your personal information</h2>
	<p>Except as described below, personal information you provide  to Interactive Medical Media through our websites will not be shared outside of  Interactive Medical Media and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates  without your permission.</p>
	<p>Disclosure to service providers. Interactive Medical Media  contracts with other companies to provide services on our behalf, such as  hosting websites, sending out information, processing transactions, and  analyzing our websites. We provide these companies with only those elements of  your personal information they need to deliver those services. These companies  and their employees are prohibited from using that personal information for any  other purpose. </p>
	<p>Disclosure to distributors. In responding to a request made  by you, we may share your personal information with companies that distribute  our products. In those cases, we provide these companies with only those  elements of your personal information they need to respond to your request, and  these companies and their employees are prohibited from using that personal  information for any other purpose. In some cases, we may seek your permission  to share your information with distributors for marketing purposes other than  responding to a request from you. However, we will not share your information  for such marketing purposes unless we have obtained your express consent to do  so.</p>
	<p>Disclosure in connection with transactions. In connection  with certain transactions, we may disclose some or all of your personal  information to financial institutions, government entities, and shipping  companies or postal services involved in fulfillment.</p>

Circumstances may arise where for strategic or other business reasons Interactive  Medical Media decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in  some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal  information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers.  It is Interactive Medical Media's practice to seek appropriate protection for  information in these types of transactions.</p>
	<p>Disclosure for other reasons. We may disclose personal  information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such  action is necessary to comply with legal requirements or with legal process  served on us, to protect and defend our rights or property, or in urgent  circumstances to protect the personal safety of any individual. </p>
      
	<h2>Security</h2>
	<p>Interactive Medical Media is committed to protecting the  security of your personal information. We use a variety of security  technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from  unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal  information you provide on computer systems with limited access that are  located in facilities to which access is limited. For sites to which you login,  it is your responsibility to ensure the security of your password and not to  reveal this information to others. When you move around a site to which you  have logged in, or from one site to another that uses the same login mechanism,  we verify your identity by means of an encrypted cookie placed on your machine.</p>

	<h2>Reviewing your personal information</h2>
	<p>In some cases, you can review and correct personal  information provided through our websites by going to the page on which you  provided the information. In all cases, you can make a request to review and  correct your personal information collected via our websites or ask Interactive  Medical Media to stop using it by completing our Contact Us form.

We may  also store and process the information there. Although the laws that protect  personal information in those countries may differ from the laws where you  live, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected.  By using our websites and giving your information to us, you consent to the  transfer of the data outside of your country. </p>

We also link to third-party providers that  host, maintain and operate on-line training curricula. While we try to link  only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not  responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other  sites.</p>
