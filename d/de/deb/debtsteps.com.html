    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>PRIVACY POLICY - Last Updated: August 30, 2011</h2>
    DebtSteps.com strives 
    to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide 
    an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable 
    Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) 
    subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or 
    rent your email address to anyone. 
    <h3>How we gather information from users:</h3>
    How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, 
    the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided.<br>
    <br>
    For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for 
    access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as 
    newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when 
    you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, 
    and other interactive areas of our site. <br>
    <br>
    Like most Web sites, DebtSteps.com also collects information automatically 
    and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. 
    For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use 
    cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among 
    other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you 
    from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control 
    the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting 
    our site. <br>
    <br>
    As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through 
    other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, 
    for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you 
    do, you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked 
    to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize 
    the site's features according to your preferences.<br>
    <br>
    While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties 
    may use cookies, web beacons or other technology to attempt to identify some 
    of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of 
    our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies and web 
    beacons that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular 
    advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer services 
    operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather 
    information. DebtSteps.com does not control the use of this technology by 
    third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any 
    actions or policies of such third parties.<br>
    <br>
    A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor your journey around 
    a single website or collection of sites. They are also referred to as web 
    bugs and are commonly used by sites that hire third-party services to monitor 
    traffic. They may be used in association with cookies to understand how visitors 
    interact with the pages and content on the pages of a web site.<br>
    <br>
    Some third-party advertisements may be provided by Google, which uses cookies 
    to serve ads on this site. Google uses the DART cookie, which enables it to 
    serve ads to our users based on their visits to this site and other sites 
    on the Web. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the 
    <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">Google ad 
    and content network privacy policy</a>. 
    <h3>What we do with the information we collect:</h3>
    Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and 
    deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy 
    and do not share your information with anyone.<br>
    <br>
    Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) 
    may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your 
    usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help 
    enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most 
    or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally 
    be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information 
    does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow 
    anyone to identify you individually.<br>
    <br>
    We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on DebtSteps.com 
    to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; 
    our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by 
    DebtSteps.com and other topics we think you might find of interest. <br>
    <br>
    Personally Identifiable Information collected by DebtSteps.com may also be 
    used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, 
    troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of 
    sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. <br>
    <br>
    Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our 
    site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We 
    will use your information only as permitted by law. <br>
    <br>
    In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we 
    may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such 
    transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. <br>
    <br>
    We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other 
    times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection 
    with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement 
    authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may 
    not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.<br>
    <br>
    Affiliated sites, linked sites and DebtSteps.com expects its partners, advertisers 
    and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that 
    third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content 
    providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data 
    collection policies and practices. <br>
    <br>
    For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part 
    of a frame on a DebtSteps.com page, certain content that is actually created 
    or hosted by a third party. Also, through DebtSteps.com you may be introduced 
    to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes 
    offered by other parties. <br>
    <br>
    DebtSteps.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third 
    parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties 
    when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.<br>
    <br>
    You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable 
    Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed 
    publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge 
    and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. 
    Such activities are beyond the control of DebtSteps.com and this policy. 
    <h3>Contacting Us:</h3>
    We can be reached by contacting us by using our <a href="feedback.html">contact 
    form</a>. 
    <h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>
    DebtSteps.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please 
    check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following 
    the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. 
    Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used 
    according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information was 
    collected. 
    <h3>Governing Law</h3>
    This policy and the use of this Site are governed by New York law. If a dispute 
    arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with the help 
    of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: St. Lawrence 
    County, New York. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with 
    the mediation will be shared equally by each of us.<br>
    <br>
    If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through 
    mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration at the following 
    location: St. Lawrence County, New York, under the rules of the American Arbitration 
    Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered 
    in any court with jurisdiction to do so.<br>
    <br>
    DebtSteps.com is controlled, operated and administered entirely within DebtSteps.com. 
    This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do 
    not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party. 
    <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age 
    of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the 
    age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems. <br>
    <br>
    DebtSteps.com encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a 
    few tips to help make a child's online experience safer: 
    <blockquote> Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised 
      by a parent or responsible adult. Includes name, address, phone, school, 
      etc. <br>
      <br>
      Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate. <br>
      <br>
      Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information is 
      treated. <br>
