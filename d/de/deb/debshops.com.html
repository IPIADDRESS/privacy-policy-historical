<p class="header">Our Privacy Policy</p>

<p><b>General</b></p>

<p>At debshops.com ("Deb Shops"), we respect and understand our customers' concerns about privacy, and we strive to handle your personal information in a safe and responsible manner.  Therefore, we have developed this Privacy Policy to describe the privacy practices of debshops.com and to inform you of the information we collect about you during your visits to our website and how we use and disclose that information. </p>

<p>Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy apply only to information gathered through our website and, where applicable, through our website's Customer Service Department, and do not necessarily reflect our practices with respect to information gathered through other means. For questions or comments concerning this Privacy Policy, contact <a href="mailto:customerservice@debshops.com">customerservice@debshops.com</a> or write to Customer Service, Deb Shops Inc., 9401 Blue Grass Road, Philadelphia, PA 19114. </p>

<p>It is important to remember that by using our website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We suggest that you refer to this policy on a regular basis as it may change to improve our service to you or for other business purposes or legal reasons. </p>

<p><b>Information We Collect</b></p>

<p>We collect information from you in different areas of our website and when you interact with our website's Customer Service Department. </p>

<blockquote><p><b><u>Ordering Products or Requesting Information</u></b><br>
When you order products from our website, we ask you to provide us with information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, credit card number and expiration date.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>When you request information from us, we may ask you for information such as your name, mailing address and e-mail address in order for us to properly respond. However, you do not have to respond to these requests to continue to use our website. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b><u>Contests, Sweepstakes and Other Promotional Activity</u></b><br>
When you participate in a contest, sweepstakes or other promotional activity, we may require you to provide your name, mailing address and/or e-mail address so we can properly administer it and notify winners.  When we run a contest or sweepstakes relating to our website, it will be accompanied by a set of rules.  The rules for each contest/sweepstakes will specify how the information gathered from you for entry will be used and disclosed, if different than as described in this Privacy Policy. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b><u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</u></b><br>
In the course of using our website, we may automatically collect certain information about you. This information includes the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our website or not), which URL you go to next (whether this URL is on our website or not), what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. Many sites automatically collect this information. In addition, we use cookies on certain pages of our website. Among other functions, cookies allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information which is targeted to your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our website. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b><u>Communicating With Us</u></b><br>
If you send us personal correspondence, such as e-mails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on our website, we may collect such information. </p></blockquote>

<p>There may be other forms and sources of information we collect about you as well, depending on how you use our website. </p>

<p><b>Our Use and Disclosure of Your Information</b></p>

<p>We will not sell, rent or in any way disclose your personally identifiable information to any third party outside of debshops.com, its parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, operating companies and other related entities, and its service providers, except with your consent or as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<blockquote><p><b><u>Product Orders and Information; Website Services</u></b><br>
We may use and share with our service providers personally identifiable information that you provide to us through our website or through our website's Customer Service Department. In turn, our service providers may share this personally identifiable information with their affiliates and with service providers whom they engage to perform services related to our website or the operation of our business. Examples of these services include website operation, payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, order fulfillment and shipping, customer service, product customization, marketing and promotional material distribution, data analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing. These service providers are authorized to use this personally identifiable information only in connection with the services they are engaged to perform.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>We use personally identifiable information to improve our services, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and to customize our website's content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to improve our website and better tailor it to meet our users' needs. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>We may also use your personally identifiable information to deliver information to you directly and through our affiliates and service providers that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners and promotions. If you supply us with your e-mail address, you may receive occasional e-mail from us and our affiliates announcing product information, promotional events, or updates to our website. If you supply us with your mailing address, you may receive periodic mailings from us and our affiliates.  </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>We may aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in aggregate form to advertisers and for other marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you. Certain information, to the extent we have received it from you, such as your password and credit card information, are not disclosed in aggregate form at all.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>We may use your e-mail address, and in infrequent situations your mailing address or phone number, to contact you regarding administrative matters from time to time. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>We may use information we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on our website, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our website Terms and Conditions.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b><u>Third Party Services</u></b><br>
We may offer features on our website where we will, by necessity, need to provide some of your information to a third party offering applicable services. Before you use the applicable third party services, you should evaluate whether you will accept the third party's terms and conditions. We are not responsible for how such third parties collect and use your information. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b><u>Legal Proceedings and Protection of Intellectual Property and Safety</u></b><br>
If we receive legal process calling for the production of information (such as a court order, a subpoena, a civil discovery request or a law enforcement investigative demand), we will produce personally identifiable information that responds to the legal process to the extent we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.  We also will disclose personally identifiable information to assist third parties seeking to protect their intellectual property rights, or to the extent necessary for Deb Shops to protect its own rights or property, the safety of its employees, or the rights or safety of others.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b><u>Business Transactions</u></b><br>
Deb Shops may acquire other businesses, and other businesses may acquire Deb Shops.  If that occurs, the information we collect may be one of the assets examined or transferred as part of the transaction.  We will not permit another business to examine the information we have collected without a confidentiality agreement.  We will not transfer the information we have collected unless the recipient agrees to provide privacy protections equal to or exceeding those established by this Privacy Policy.  In the unlikely event that Deb Shops is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, we may sell your information to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b><u>Other Exceptions</u></b><br>
Due to various regulatory requirements and the nature of the Internet, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be required to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private. </p></blockquote>

<p><b>Control of Your Password</b></p>

<p>You should not disclose your password to any third parties or share it with any third parties. If, despite the foregoing, you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password as detailed below. </p>

<p><b>Reviewing and Changing Your Personally Identifiable Information</b></p>

<p>If you register on our website, you will be able to review and change some of the personally identifiable information that you have provided, by clicking on "Manage Your Account" within the Help Desk area of our website.  </p>

<p>Please be advised that information you have asked us to remove may remain in our databases in order to enable us to comply with legal requirements and/or due to the fact that we back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. </p>

<p><b>Opting Out of Promotional Communications and Information Sharing</b></p>

<p>You may opt out of future promotional communications and certain third-party disclosures in a number of ways.  When you set up an account, or click on "Manage Your Account" within the Help Desk area, or place an order, you will have an opportunity to make or change your selections in this regard. You also will have an opportunity to change these selections by clicking on an "unsubscribe" hyperlink contained in promotional emails we send you.</p>

<p><b>Third Party Collectors of Information</b></p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are other users, merchants or advertisers on our system or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party merchants and advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy customs and policies. Since we do not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personally identifiable information to others. </p>

<p><b>Security</b></p>

<p>We use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology.  SSL technology encrypts certain information you input into our website before sending the information over the Internet, in an effort to protect your information from unauthorized access in transmission.  In addition, once we receive your personal information, we store in on a secure server.  Please keep in mind that no security system is a guarantee against unauthorized intrusions either during transmission over the Internet or while information is in storage.</p>

<p><b>A Note To Parents and Children 13 and Younger</b></p>

<p>Except as provided below, we do not collect personally identifiable information from anyone we know to be 13 years old or younger.  If you are a parent and believe we may have inadvertently collected such information from your child, please notify us by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:customerservice@debshops.com">customerservice@debshops.com</a>.</p>

<p><b>Contacting Our Website</b></p>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the privacy practices of our website, you can contact <a href="mailto:customerservice@debshops.com">customerservice@debshops.com</a>.</p>

<p><b>Notice of Changes to this Policy</b></p>

<p>If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy here.  We also may post a notice on our website or send an email describing the changes. If we revise this Privacy Policy, we will not use or share your information in a manner that is incompatible with the policy in effect when your information was collected, without your consent.</p>
