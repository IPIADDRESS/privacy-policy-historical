If you provide additional information to a service provider directly, then their use of your information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.</span></li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-color-black"><strong>Timeframe</strong>&nbsp;– We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-color-black">To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-color-black">If you have an account with us your Personal Information will be kept by us for as long as your account remains active. If you deactivate your account your personal information will be kept for a reasonable period of time after this so that we can complete any activities already initiated or where we have a need to retain your personal information for legal or technical reasons (including back-up systems) for example to retain proof of transactions for the enforcement of our rights, and to enable the other party to a transaction to access records of past purchases or sales. Following this period we will either delete the information or change it to a form that does not identify you.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-color-black">For details of retention periods for other aspects of your personal information please contact us at&nbsp;<strong><a href="mailto:data@depop.com">data@depop.com</a></strong>.</span></p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-color-black"><strong>Transfers outside of your country of residence</strong>&nbsp;– the personal information we collect may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the EEA including to our affiliates and our third party Service moderators. It may also be processed by staff (who work for us or for one of our suppliers) and other users of the Service operating outside the EEA, in order to fulfil a purchase, process payment details and provide support and verification services. Some of these jurisdictions offer differing levels of protection in respect of personal information and may, in certain instances, be less protective than the UK. However the transfer of your data to other countries in line with this Privacy Policy, shall only be to countries in respect of which an adequacy decision has been issued by the European Commission, or where the entity is bound an appropriate confidentiality and data transfer agreement as deemed adequate by the European Commission (details of which we are happy to share with you on request as per the “<a href="#contacting-us" target="_self">Contacting Us</a>” section below). Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal information shared between Europe and the US. If we collect your personal information in Australia, it may also be transferred to and stored in countries outside Australia including to our affiliates and our third party service providers who are located in countries including the UK, USA, and India. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and any relevant privacy laws. By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-color-black">Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

We may charge you a reasonable fee or refuse to comply with your request if it is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month (once we have been able to verify your identity). Occasionally it may take us longer than this if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-color-black"><strong>Right to request correction of your information:</strong>&nbsp;You may ask us to make any necessary changes to ensure that the data we hold about you is accurate and kept up to date.

We may not always be able to comply with your request for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-color-black"><strong>Right to object to processing:</strong>&nbsp;You may object to use processing your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest where you believe it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. We will consider any such objection, however in some cases we may demonstrate that our legitimate grounds override your rights and freedoms. You may also object to us processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes (see “<a href="#your-marketing-preferences" target="_self">Your Marketing Preferences</a>” above for further information about how to do this).</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-color-black"><strong>Right to restriction of processing:</strong>&nbsp;You may ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-color-black"><strong>Right to request the transfer of your information:</strong>&nbsp;You have the right to request a transfer of certain of your personal information to you or a third party of your choice, which we will provide in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.</span></p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-color-black"><strong>Right to opt-out of behavioural analytics:</strong>&nbsp;If you do not want us to conduct behavioural analytics for the purposes of Depop’s internal algorithm used to display relevant sellers and items to you or to display your items to the most relevant potential buyers, you must close your Depop account and cease using our Service. This is because it is essential to Depop to suggest the right items and sellers to you and to display your items to the right buyers which we can only do by learning about your tastes and preferences and the types of products you list.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-color-black">To exercise any of the above rights, or if you have any questions relating to your rights, please contact us by using the details set out in the “<a href="#contacting-us" target="_self">Contacting us</a>” section below.

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-color-black">Most of the personal information we hold about you is either available directly from viewing your account and looking back over your own activities or is available from the social networks that you have connected to our Service.
