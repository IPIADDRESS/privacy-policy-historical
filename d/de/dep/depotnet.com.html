  <p> <strong class="subtitle"> Our Commitment to Privacy</strong> <span class="regtext"> <br> Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the highest-quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our clients and partners. The Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site and our products and services. This statement will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers' needs.</span> <br> <strong class="subtitle"><br> What Information Do We Collect?</strong> <br> <span class="regtext">When  you visit <a href="http://www.depotnet.com" title="www.depotnet.com">www.depotnet.com</a> or using associated products, you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web site use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site or use our products.</span></p>
<p> <span class="maintitle"><strong>1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide</strong> <strong>Credit  Card Information</strong></span> <br> <span class="regtext">If you choose to purchase products or services from us, you may need to give personal or business information and authorization to obtain information from various credit services.</span></p>
<p> <strong class="subtitle">Email Information</strong> <br> <span class="regtext">In addition to providing the foregoing information to us, if you choose to correspond further with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.</span></p>
<p> <strong class="maintitle">2. Web Site Use Information</strong> <br> <span class="regtext">Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard technology called “cookies” (see explanation below, “What Are Cookies?”) and Web server logs to collect information about how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site. This information is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with you as an individual.</span></p>
<p> <strong class="subtitle">How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</strong> <br> <span class="regtext">Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing customer service and making available other products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. The lists used to send you product and service offers are developed and managed under our traditional business standards designed to safeguard the security and privacy of our customers’ personal information. As a customer, you will always be given the opportunity to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers.</span></p>
<p> <strong class="subtitle">What  Are Cookies?</strong> <br> <span class="regtext">Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s Web browser on the user’s hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user’s transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.</span><br> <span class="subtitle"><br> <strong>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</strong></span> <br> <span class="regtext">We use Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to gather information about our Web site users’ browsing activities, in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers. This information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the user-friendliest manner and to continually improve our Web site to better meet the needs of our customers and prospective customers.<br> Cookies help us collect important business and technical statistics. The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users to our Web site as they move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count how many people visit our Web site and evaluate our Web site’s visitor capacity. We do not use these technologies to capture your individual email address or any personally identifying information about you.</span></p>
<p> <strong class="subtitle">Sharing Information with Strategic Partners</strong> <br> <span class="regtext">We may enter into strategic alliances or partnerships to provide you with additional shopping cart related services and they may be given access to personal information including your name, address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to you. In connection with strategic alliances or partnerships, we will retain all ownership rights to the information, and we will not share information regarding your personal financial data. </span><br> <span class="subtitle"><br> <strong>Notice of New Services and Changes</strong></span> <br> <span class="regtext">Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. As our client, you will be given the opportunity to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers by sending us an email request at en.general[AT]depotnet.com</span></p>
<p> <strong class="subtitle">How Do We Secure Information Transmissions?</strong> <br> <span class="regtext">When you send confidential personal credit card information to us on our Web site, secure server software, which we have licensed, encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. The information is scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches our Web site.<br> Other email that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as Social Security or account numbers to us through an unsecured email. </span></p>
<p> <strong class="subtitle">How Do We Protect Your Information?</strong> <br> <span class="regtext"><strong>Information  Security.</strong> We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration or destruction.</span></p>
<p> <strong>Evaluation  of Information Protection Practices</strong>. Periodically, our operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies and procedures governing the security, confidentiality and quality of our information.</p>
<p> <strong>Employee  Access, Training and Expectations.</strong> Our corporate values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed to the protection of customer information. In general, our business practices limit employee access to confidential information, and limit the use and disclosure of such information to authorized persons, processes and transactions.</p>
<p> <strong class="subtitle">How Can You Access and Correct Your Information? </strong> <br> <span class="regtext">You may request in writing access to all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and make changes to the information by emailing en.general[AT]depotnet.com</span></p>
<p> <strong class="subtitle">What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</strong> <br> <span class="regtext">We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. </span></p>
<p> <strong class="subtitle">What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</strong> <br> <span class="regtext">We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from neither our Web site nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site.<br> Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Web site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other Web site, including Web sites, which have a link on our Web site, is subject to that Web site’s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.<br> </span><br> <strong class="subtitle">Your Consent</strong> <br> <span class="regtext">By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our Web site to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.</span> </p><p></p>
