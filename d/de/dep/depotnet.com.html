we periodically make such information, including aggregated information,

those who trade or rent information for direct marketing purposes. 
However, we do not make you, or your gift recipient's email addresses 
available to third parties (except for subsidiaries, subcontractors or

and you will continue to have the right to opt-out of sharing your information with third parties.

We may disclose any information you provide to DepotNet.com (i) when we believe disclosure 
to be appropriate to comply with any law, regulation, or governmental request, 
or to comply with judicial process; or (ii) if such disclosure is necessary or 
appropriate to operate this web site; or (iii) to protect the rights or property 
of DepotNet.com, its users, Sponsors, Providers, Licensors, or Merchants.
