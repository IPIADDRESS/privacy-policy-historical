        <p>This online privacy policy describes how we (and our Service Providers) may collect, use, share, and keep information that we get about you. We gather Online Information, which is data or information collected on the TIAMG sites and applications as well as on sites and applications of third parties relating to topics about our business, and Other Information, which is TIAMG internal information (for example subscription transaction data), external data used to process transactions and other online and offline data, including data collected from or about you via telephone, postal mail, in person and from Business Partners.</p>

			<li>Interact with us through social media sites and other sites and applications</li>
			
        </ul>
        
        <p>In this policy, we also explain how we may combine Online Information and Other Information we collect from you and how we then use the combined information. </p>
        
        
        <h2 id="what_we_collect"><br>What information do we collect and how do we collect it?</h2>

        <h2 id="california">Your California Privacy Rights: Notice to California Customers</h2>
        
        <p>California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. (Note: TIAMG sites do not recognize the "do not track signals" that some browsers may employ.) As discussed above, if you wish to opt-out of our sharing of your information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes offline please <a href="optout/amgoffline/" target="_blank">click here</a>, or for email please <a href="optout/amgemail/" target="_blank">click here</a>. To find out more about your opt-out rights, please contact us as described in the "How to Contact Us" section below.</p>
        
        
        <h2 id="how_do_we_share">How do we share your information?</h2>
        
        <p>Some Online Information and Other Information is Personal Information, which is information that can identify a person, such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, date of birth and credit or debit card information.</p>
        
        
        <h2 id="how_we_treat">How we treat your Personal Information</h2>
        
        <p>We do not share Personal Information with anyone except as described below. We may share Personal Information as required or as permitted by law, such as:</p>
        
        <ul>
        	<li>With regulatory authorities, courts, and governmental agencies to comply with legal orders, legal or regulatory requirements, and government requests;</li>
			<li>With our <a href="#def_service_providers">Service Providers</a>, regulatory authorities, and governmental agencies to detect and prevent fraud or criminal activity, and to protect the rights of  TIAMG or others;</li>

        </ul>


		<h2 id="how_we_handle">How we handle Aggregate and De-Identified Information</h2>
        
        <p><a href="#def_aggregate_information">Aggregate Information</a> or <a href="#def_deidentified_information">De-Identified Information</a> does not identify you individually; it helps us to analyze patterns among groups of people. We may share <a href="#def_aggregate_information">Aggregate Information</a> or <a href="#def_deidentified_information">De-Identified Information</a> in several ways, for example:</p>
        
        <ul>
        	<li>For the same reasons as we might share Personal Information;</li>
			<li>With <a href="#def_business_partners">Business Partners</a> to help develop and market products and deliver targeted content and ads;</li>
			<li>With <a href="#def_business_partners">Business Partners</a> to conduct analysis and research  about customers and site visitors; or</li>

        </ul>
        
        <p>Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.</p>
        
        
        <h2 id="how_do_we_keep">How do we keep and safeguard your information?</h2>
        
        <p>We use administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and facilities.  No system can be completely secure, however, and we do not guarantee that unauthorized disclosures and access will not happen.</p>
        
        <p>We will keep your Online Information and Other Information as long as necessary to deliver our products and services, unless we are required by law or regulation or for litigation and regulatory investigations to keep it for a longer period of time.</p>
        
        
        <h2 id="what_are_your_choices">What are your choices?</h2>
        
        <p>You have choices about how TIAMG uses your information, such as how we market to you or how we manage <a href="#def_cookies">Cookies or Similar Technologies</a>[1].</p>
        
        
        <h2>What are your choices about how we directly market to you?</h2>
        
        <p>You can choose how you would like to receive direct marketing communications - whether we send them to you through postal mail, email and/or telephone. If you choose to not receive marketing communications from us, we will honor your choice. Please be aware that if you choose not to receive such communications, certain offers attached to the products or services you have chosen may be affected. We will still communicate with you in connection with servicing your account, fulfilling your requests, or administering any promotion or any program in which you have elected to participate.</p>
        
        
        <h2 id="def_collection_of_information">Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors</h2>
        
        <p>Some of our sites contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. You should consult the other sites' and services' privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties or their use of your information.</p>
        
        <p>TIAMG sites sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, promotions, editorial features, or other activities or offerings that are sponsored or co-sponsored by or presented with identified third parties. By virtue of your participation in such activities or offerings, your IP address and the personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit may be provided to both the TIAMG site and the third parties.  TIAMG has no control over the third parties' use of this information.</p>
        
        
        <h2 id="def_how_we_serve_advertising">How we serve advertising</h2>
        
        <p>We use reputable third parties to serve advertisements, including Online Behavioral Advertisements, that you may see on the web pages and to conduct research about the advertisements. This privacy notice does not cover any use of information that such third parties may have collected from you (e.g., type of browser, operating system, domain name, day and time of visit, page(s) visited) or the methods used by the third-parties to collect that information (e.g., cookies, web beacons and clear gifs). </p>

        <h2 id="def_accessing_correcting">Accessing, Correcting, and Deleting Your Personal Information</h2>
        
        <p>We will take reasonable steps to accurately record the personal information that you provide to us and any subsequent updates.</p>
