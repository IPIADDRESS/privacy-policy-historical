      <h4>
    This policy is effective as of March 7th, 2011.</h4>


<p>
    DealPop is a service of WhitePages, Inc. This privacy policy will help you understand the different types of information we collect when you use our service (the "Dealpop Service"). By using our Dealpop Service, you agree to our privacy policy and <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>. We may change or update this policy from time to time. Any updated policy shall be effective immediately after it is posted.</p>


<h3>
    The Information We Collect &amp; How We Use It</h3>


<p>
    There are two categories of information that we collect from you:</p>


<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Personal Information</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            General Information</p>
    </li>
</ol>


<p>
    In addition to the specific uses noted below, we may use, store and review information we collect from you for a variety of internal business purposes, such as to provide, monitor and maintain the Dealpop Service, provide you with a better user experience and develop new services. We also may use General Information to deliver advertisements that match your interests (though not unsolicited third-party email).</p>


<h4>
    1. Personal Information</h4>


<p>
    This is information that you provide when using the Dealpop Service which identifies you by full name, full postal address, phone number or email address, or includes information necessary to process payment for the Dealpop Service. Examples of Personal Information include your username and password and payment information such as a credit card number, expiration date, and billing address.</p>


<p>
    <strong>How we use it:</strong></p>


<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            We may use Personal Information for the purposes for which it was provided, such as to process transactions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            We may use your email address to send email about your account or marketing messages.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            You can always choose not to receive any marketing email. We offer an "unsubscribe" in the marketing emails we send. If you choose not to receive marketing email, you may still receive WhitePages email and other communication (e.g. SMS, text messages, etc.) from us based on DealPop Service.</p>
    </li>
</ul>


<h4>
    2. General Information</h4>


<p>
    This information includes things like your browser type, IP address, the date and time of your visits, locality (your city and state), which web pages you viewed, searches you conducted, and other communications through the Dealpop Service. Through surveys we may collect General Information, such as your age, gender or interests.</p>


<p>
    We use cookies, web beacons and GPS information (for mobile devices) to collect General Information.</p>


<p>
    A <strong>cookie</strong> is a small file that we send to your computer to identify your web browser. Most browsers allow you to disable cookies (which prevents our servers from sending cookies to your browser). However, the Service may not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>


<p>
    A <strong>web beacon</strong> is a small graphic file used to identify if a page has been viewed.</p>


<p>
    <strong>GPS Information</strong> includes city, state and other information when you use the Service on a GPS-enabled mobile device.</p>


<p>
    <strong>How we use it:</strong></p>


<p>
    We use General Information to facilitate your use of the Dealpop Service and to help us understand how people like you use the Dealpop Service. For example, we may use cookies to keep you logged in to your account, track your use of the Dealpop Service, pre-populate certain fields (like your default location), and to deliver advertising that matches your interests. We may use GPS information to pre-populate certain search fields on your GPS-enabled mobile device.</p>


<h3>
    How Third Parties Collect &amp; Use Your Information</h3>


<h4>
    Delivery of Advertisements</h4>


<p>
    We work with Google and other third party companies to deliver DealPop advertisements on third party websites. These third party companies may collect and use General Information to deliver more relevant advertising to you and for their own business purposes. Third party vendors, including Google, may use cookies to serve ads based on&nbsp;your prior visits to your website.</p>


<h4>
    Third Party Links</h4>


<p>
    There are links to other websites and pages provided by third parties on DealPop. Any personal information you enter is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy. It's important to remember that we do not have control over the privacy policies of advertisers or other third-party websites and we encourage you to read the privacy policy of the advertiser or third-party website.</p>


<h4>
    Analysis of Your Data</h4>


<p>
    We may use third parties to help measure the effectiveness of our advertising and to analyze usage of the Dealpop Service. Third parties help us analyze General Information we obtain from you (we generally place restrictions on those third parties' use of such information). Third parties may also use the General Information for their business purposes, such as to report aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about the use of their services and technologies in connection with the Service.</p>

    We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties. We may share the information subject to this policy, but only in the following circumstances:</p>


<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>To help us provide the Dealpop Service to you.</strong> We may share information with third parties to complete transactions you've requested or to perform services on our behalf. Third parties who perform services on our behalf are obligated to use the information for the purpose it was provided.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>To comply with the law.</strong> We may disclose information we collect (including Personal Information) when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law, such as in response to a subpoena or court order.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>For safety reasons or to protect our interests.</strong> We may disclose information we collect (including Personal Information) in order to prevent damage to our property (tangible and intangible), for safety reasons or in the course of collecting amounts owed to us.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Business transfers.</strong> We will not sell Personal Information unless it is in the context of a merger, acquisition, business reorganization, debt financing or sale of company assets, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership. In these transactions, the information which we collect may be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>You authorize it.</strong> We may disclose information if you authorize it. Sometimes, your authorization may be implicit.</p>
    </li>
</ol>


<h3>
    The Security of Your Personal Information</h3>


<p>
    We use reasonable security measures to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized use and disclosure while in our control. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to protect certain Personal Information. However, no security measures are perfect, and we cannot guarantee that any information will be secure from unauthorized access or use.</p>
