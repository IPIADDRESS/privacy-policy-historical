                  With the permission of a guest who is 13 years of age or over, information
                  submitted at the time of Registration or submission may be used for

                  About IP Addresses</b>
</p><p>
                  InfoMedia, Inc. collects IP addresses for the purposes of system
                  administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. 
</p><p>
                  An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer
                  whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that
                  "serve" up Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP
                  address. 
</p><p>
                  When guests request pages from InfoMedia, Inc. sites, our servers log the
                  guests' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally
                  identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user
                  remains anonymous to us. 
</p><p>
                   

<b>                  Use of Cookies -- The InfoMedia, Inc. Cookies Policy</b>
</p><p>
                  What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site
                  transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies
                  make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and
                  preferences while you're at our site. The use of cookies is an Industry
                  standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites. 
</p><p>
                  By showing how and when guests use the site, cookies help us see which
                  areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to
                  the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages
                  viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. If you accept
                  the first tracking cookie from any InfoMedia, Inc. web site, you won't be
                  offered as many afterwards.

</p><p>                   

    <b>              Examples of How InfoMedia, Inc. Sites Use Cookies</b>
</p><p>
                  A cookie lets the computers remember that you've registered, which
                  allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites. Similarly, The
                  WorldVillage Store Online uses a temporary cookie to track which products
                  you've chosen while shopping. The cookie expires once you're done
                  shopping. Letting it do the record keeping saves you the trouble of
                  entering information over and over again during a single visit. If you
                  decline this cookie, you may have difficulty ordering your selections. 
</p><p>
                   

   <b>               How InfoMedia, Inc. Sites Do Not Use Cookies</b>
</p><p>
                  InfoMedia, Inc. sites never use cookies to retrieve information from your
                  computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except as described
                  below, InfoMedia, Inc. sites do not use information transferred through
                  cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information
                  shared with any third parties whatsoever. 
</p><p>
                  InfoMedia, Inc. sites do not use cookies to identify specific individuals,
                  except in such cases as online shopping (see above) and contest
                  registration (where a cookie allows you to enter a contest every day
                  without registering again each time).
</p><p>
                  You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. InfoMedia, Inc. does
                  not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to the InfoMedia, Inc. cookie policy. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party
                  servers is standard in the Internet industry. 
</p><p>
                  Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can
                  set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent.
                  However, it is possible that some parts of the site, such as the shopping,
                  contest, and game areas, will not function properly if you do so.

   <b>               Links to Other Sites</b>
</p><p>
                  Users should be aware that when you are on InfoMedia, Inc. sites you could
                  be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to
                  other sites from InfoMedia, Inc. sites that take you outside our service. For
                  example, if you click on a banner advertisement or a InfoMedia, Inc. search
                  result, the click takes you off the InfoMedia, Inc. site. This includes links
                  from advertisers, sponsors, and partners that may use InfoMedia, Inc.’s logo
                  as part of a cobranding agreement. These other sites may send their own
                  cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Always be
                  aware of where you end up.
</p><p>
                  Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information
                  online -– for example, via message boards or chat -– that information can
                  be collected and used by people you don’t know. While InfoMedia, Inc.
                  strives to protect its users' personal information and privacy, we cannot
                  guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you do
                  so at your own risk.
