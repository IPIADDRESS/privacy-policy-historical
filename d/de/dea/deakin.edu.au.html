<h2>Privacy statement</h2>
<h3>Privacy of visitors to Deakin University website</h3>
<p>
	Deakin University respects the privacy of users of the Deakin University
	Website. The University complies with all legislation applicable to websites,
	including the Information Privacy Act 2000 (VIC). The Information Privacy
	Act requires public sector agencies to inform individuals when their
	personal information is being collected, and to identify how the agency
	will use that information.
</p>
<h3>What is personal information</h3>
<p>
	Personal information means information or opinions about a person which
	would reveal the identity of that person. It extends to information recorded
	in any format, including digital or electronic formats derived from computer
	access to the Deakin University Website.
</p>
<h3>How does Deakin University obtain personal information about visitors to the Deakin University website</h3>
<p>
	When a user enters the Deakin University web site, the University server
	makes a record of their visit and records the following information:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>the web browser being used to access the site</li>
	<li>the operating system on the user's computer</li>
	<li>referrer page (the web page the computer was accessing immediately prior
	to the Deakin web site)</li> 
	<li>pages/files viewed and the size of those files</li> 
	<li>types of files accessed/downloaded</li> 
	<li>date/time of visit</li> 
	<li>username and password entered if accessing restricted areas of the site</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Deakin University uses this information for on-going administration
	and development of its web site. 
</p>
<p>Deakin University also obtain personal information in the following ways:</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
	A cookie is a small, text file that is stored by a browser on a computer's
	hard drive. It has a limited lifetime – usually until the browser
	is shut down. 
	This allows web servers to remember the user on subsequent visits without
	having to prompt them for the same information. This function may be
	disabled in the web browser if the user does not wish to accept cookies,
	but this may effect their access to all parts of the Deakin University
	website. 
</p>
<p>
	Cookies are used to store both personal and non-personal information.
	Examples of personal information are encrypted username and encrypted
	password that are used by Deakin University Portal and Deakin University
	Webmail. Examples of non-personal information include the Deakin web
	server that the user has authenticated into, the top level domain name
	of the user’s Internet Service Provider, the date and the time
	of a visit to the site, the pages accessed and downloaded, the address
	of the last site visited, and the type of browser being used. 
</p>
<p>
	Cookies make it possible to identify registered users without needing
	to ask for registration details every time the user accesses a site.
	Using cookies makes accessing sites more convenient to the user as they
	don't need to remember their username and password each time they enter
	the site.
</p>
<p>
	Deakin University may also use cookies to track users as they travel
	through the site - for instance, it might use cookies to count the total
	number of unique users who are accessing the site over a particular period
	of time, or to ensure that users don't see a particular advert more than
	once. This information is purely used for our internal purposes. The
	use of cookies in this way helps to make systems more efficient. Deakin
	University
	also uses this information for monitoring its web site use, and to facilitate
	web site management, development and planning.<br>
</p>
<h3>On-Line Forms</h3>
<p>
	The University web site may offer users the opportunity to supply personal
	information to enable it to provide you with further services, including
	allowing users to access restricted areas of the website, responding
	to users’ questions by e-mail or the provision of information to
	users via email. You may also choose to complete on-line surveys or offer
	feedback to the persons responsible for maintaining the website. Users
	may in the future be able to complete enrolment and registration forms
	or access grades on-line.
</p>
<h3>How does Deakin University use personal information about visitors to its website?</h3>
<p>
	In addition to using personal information to provide services that have
	been specifically requested, Deakin University uses personal information
	about users to the website to carry on the business of the University.
	This includes the following:
</p>
<h3>Analysis of Usage</h3> 
<p>
	The University periodically analyses personal information provided by
	visitors to our website. This analysis allows the University to identify
	the needs of users, the effectiveness of its website in meeting those
	needs, and the types of improvements needed to make the website more
	effective.
</p>
<h3>Monitoring Computer Usage</h3>
<p>
	The University uses personal information to ensure that visitors to the
	Deakin University web site use the web site in compliance with Commonwealth
	and State laws, and the policies and procedures for Internet usage
	established by the University. This includes maintaining records to
	enable recovery of any costs incurred by the University in connection
	with a visitor’s usage of the Internet through the Deakin University
	server. Details are available through the Deakin University Information
	Technology Services Division homepage. 
</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
	Deakin University takes all reasonable precautions to guard against unauthorized
	access to, and loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.
	For this reason, users may be asked to provide their user name and
	password which will be used to grant access to areas of the Deakin
	University Website not available to the general public. It is important
	that users keep their password secure and do not disclose it to anyone
	else.
</p>
<h3>Disclosure of personal information to parties outside Deakin University</h3>
<p>
	The Information Privacy Act 2000 (VIC) allows the University to disclose
	Personal Information it collects under specific circumstances. In other
	circumstances not covered by the Information Privacy Act 2000, the University
	may disclose your personal information to third parties only if it has
	first received your consent to the disclosure.
</p>
<h3>What can I do if I have an inquiry or a complaint about the management of, or wish to access, my personal information? </h3>
<p>Inquiries about the management of, or access to, your personal information at Deakin University should be directed to the University's Privacy Officer.</p>
<p>If you believe the University has breached your right to privacy, you may make a written complaint providing full details, also to the University's Privacy Officer.</p>
