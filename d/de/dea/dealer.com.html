	<div class="column span-24">
		<p>Dealer Dot Com, Inc. (“Dealer.com”) takes your privacy seriously and is committed to safeguarding your privacy online.  Because we do gather certain types of information from visitors to our sites, we have developed a privacy statement to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information.  This statement discloses the types of information we gather, how it is used, and how you can gain access to and edit any data that we've collected about you at any time.</p>

		<h4>Guiding Principles:</h4>

		<p>Dealer.com respects the privacy of individuals who visit our Web sites, send us e-mail, or participate in features/services we offer online.  Accordingly, our policy regarding online privacy has been developed using the following guiding principles:</p>

		<p>Dealer.com collects information online primarily to provide our visitors with a more relevant experience on our sites.  When doing so, we will make every reasonable effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of data.  Dealer.com will take reasonable physical, electronic and managerial measures to safeguard and secure any information you provide to us (e.g. data will be stored in protected databases on secured servers with restricted access).  Dealer.com will not share any information you've provided to us with anyone without your consent other than to provide the service you've requested.</p> 

		<h4>Non-Personally Identifiable Data:</h4>

		<p>Anytime you visit our Web site, we may gather certain non-personally identifiable information regarding the means you use to access our site. This information may include the type and version of your browser, your service provider, your IP address and any search engine you may have used to locate the site.  We use this information to help diagnose problems with our server, administer the Web site, and compile broad statistical data.  In addition, we gather certain navigational information about where you go on our Web sites.  This information enables us to determine which areas of the Web sites are most frequently visited and helps us to tailor the sites to the needs and interests of our online visitors.  Such information is gathered by us in the aggregate and will not be associated with a specific individual without that individual's consent.</p>
		
		<h4>Information Voluntarily Provided:</h4>

		<p>Any information you provide to us (i.e. name, e-mail address, etc.) when you register for an event, “Contact Us,” request newsletters, information, or use any of the other interactive portions of our Web sites, is securely maintained on our Web server and internal systems.  This information may be used to provide you with information you've requested about our company, our products and our services, or to provide you with special notices.  You may opt out of receiving future communications at any time (see opt-out procedures below).

			<blockquote class="first"><p><span class="quotemark">“</span>All I can say is WOW!  I have never seen so many leads come from a dealership website  in my life.  We have cut out one of our most expensive lead providers last month because we received 383 leads from our website alone.  Closing ratios on these leads was 13.5% which is way higher than the leads we were buying.  This new site is our secret weapon.<span class="quotemark">“</span></p>
			<p class="cite">—Internet Sales Director for a BMW dealership at a top Dealer Group</p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote><p><span class="quotemark">“</span>It is obvious to me that they will be on the leading edge of whatever technology develops...and that much of that development will originate inside the walls of their beautiful new building in Burlington, Vermont. Great people…great customer service…great products and fair pricing. Plus, you know they are constantly working to upgrade the product. I heartily endorse this company, and would be more than happy to speak with anyone about&nbsp;it.<span class="quotemark">“</span></p>
				<p class="cite">—John Kimel, <a href="http://www.lewisautos.com/index.htm">Lewis Autos</a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote><p><span class="quotemark">“</span>Dealer.com ended up the clear winner for more reasons than I could list here, a few of which are: Customer service with site development, initial and ongoing training, ease of site maintenance, great details for tracking Internet customers and directing advertising dollars (made available through the use of the Web Reports), and ongoing technological upgrades provided to keep pace with an ever-changing virtual world for online shoppers.<span class="quotemark">“</span></p><p class="cite">– Mike Poulin, of <a href="http://www.shearerhummer.com/index.htm">Shearer Pontiac Cadillac Hummer</a></p></blockquote>	
			<blockquote><p><span class="quotemark">“</span>Everyday we are told about how great our site is and how easy it is to get information from. We recently started a billboard campaign called "Shop in Your Underwear at Stevebaldo.com" to capture the majority of customers already online doing research to our site, and the response has been overwhelming. Steve Baldo is truly proud to put his name on this site, and I appreciate all you and your staff have done for us.<span class="quotemark">“</span></p><p class="cite">– Sheila K.
