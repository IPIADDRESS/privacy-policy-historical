<p>dealsaver.com ("dealsaver.com", "we", "our") has a firm commitment to privacy. We take your privacy concerns seriously and want to make reasonable efforts to address them as we strive to offer our site visitors a high quality, interactive and personalized experience. This Privacy Policy explains our position on information gathering and how we intend to use and share any information we collect. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by dealsaver.com and does not apply to information obtained or used by The McClatchy Company’s individual newspapers or its affiliates through other means.</p>

<p>dealsaver.com collects and stores personally identifiable information such as your name, address, and e-mail address. The information that we collect and store about you depends on the page you visit and the services in which you elect to participate. We use this information to operate our services, improve the quality of our services, offer you opportunities we think will interest you, and better tailor the advertising you see from us to suit you. This information is not shared with anyone outside of The McClatchy Company’s individual newspapers andDealSaver.com except as provided for in this Privacy Policy or as explained at the time the information is collected. More specifics on the information we collect and how we use it are outlined within this Privacy Policy.</p>

If you are a registered member of dealsaver.com, you will be notified of material revisions to this Privacy Policy via an e-mail message to the e-mail address that you provided at registration. If you are not a registered member of dealsaver.com, you may view revisions to this Privacy Policy on this page. Material changes to this Privacy Policy will be indicated by a revised effective date at the top left hand corner of this page and by a notice posted on the homepage of dealsaver.com. Whether or not you are a registered member of dealsaver.com, it is your responsibility to check back and review this page regularly to ensure you are familiar with the most current terms. Should you object to any such modifications to this Privacy Policy or become dissatisfied with dealsaver.com in any way, your only option is to immediately terminate your membership and discontinue use of dealsaver.com.

<h5>Information we collect</h5>

<p>Access to certain special content, services and features on dealsaver.com may require users to be subscribers to a local McClatchy Company individual newspaper and/or to become registered members at  dealsaver.com. Member registration may require you to provide certain personally identifiable information, such as your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number, gender, and date of birth. If you choose to purchase a daily deal or other offer, a print subscription to a local McClatchy Company individual newspaper or a classified ad when you register, we also require credit card and billing information. For more information about how we use your credit card and billing information, see the Section below titled "Electronic commerce". You will be asked to select a member name and password so that you have access to this information and can revise it in the future. To complete the registration process, we will send you a validation e-mail message. You must click the link in the e-mail to fully activate your membership account. At registration you will have the opportunity to Opt out of subscribing to e-mail newsletters and alerts sent to you on behalf of dealsaver.com and its advertisers.</p>

<p>Some features and services of dealsaver.com may require additional personally identifiable information or other demographic information. We may collect other personally identifiable information when you provide feedback, comments, engage in chat, message boards, interactive forums or participate in surveys, or if you contact us offline. For example, when you enter contests you will be asked to also provide your phone number so that we can reach you in the event you have won a prize. All users may decline to share such information with us, by choosing not to register on dealsaver.com or not to use our services. Only registered members, however, may access certain content, services and features.</p>

<p>You may also be asked to create a separate registration account with some of the services provided by partners and other third-party providers on dealsaver.com. Be aware that the information collected by a third-party provider will be subject to that provider's privacy policy and terms of service, rather than this Privacy Policy. We, therefore, recommend you review the privacy policy of each third-party service provider with whom you interact and each Web site you visit prior to submitting information in connection therewith.</p>

<p>If you wish to forward an deal offer, coupon, article or other dealsaver.com content to a friend, we will ask that you provide your friend's name and e-mail address. While we may collect statistics on which articles are forwarded, we do not sell, rent, or market your friend's personal information, and retain the information only as long as necessary to provide this service.</p>

<h5>Passive data collection and use</h5>

<p>Like most Web sites, dealsaver.com also collects and logs information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to you, such as your IP address, the name and location of your Internet Service Provider, the type and version of your browser, the length of time that you stay on dealsaver.com, search queries, your click-stream data, the location that referred you to dealsaver.com and the average number of pages viewed. If you visit another Web site prior to browsing dealsaver.com, that Web site might place personally identifiable information within a URL, which may be logged by us. Your IP address is the identifier assigned to your particular computer when you access the Internet. Depending on how you connect to the Internet, your IP address may always be the same, or it may change each time you access the Internet. Note that logging your IP address does not in and of itself provide us with your name, e-mail address or home or work address. We use this log information for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes and may also use it to gather general demographic information about you such as your general location and your Internet Service Provider. To better provide our services to you and to develop member profiles that enable us to tailor dealsaver.com's services and its advertisements to your interests, we may correlate this log information with other information about you, such as your registration information, purchase history or newspaper subscription records. We may provide to third parties anonymous aggregated (non-personally identifiable) general information about our Web site and its users.</p>

<h5>Use of cookies</h5>

<p>Most standard Web browsers contain a feature called "cookies," which allow a Web site to place information about a user's visit to that Web site in a small data text file that is stored on the user's computer. Our use of cookie technology will likely be transparent to you and is used to recognize you and hold information from one visit to the next in an effort to increase your ease of use of dealsaver.com and to allow us to better understand how people use dealsaver.com through click-stream analysis. For example, cookies may be used to store information such as your member name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit. Another example is that we may use cookie technology to limit the number of times you see a particular advertisement while visiting dealsaver.com. You can turn the cookies feature off by using your browser preference options, but doing so will severely limit your access to dealsaver.com and may prevent you from using certain functions.</p>

<p>Some of dealsaver.com's third-party content and service providers also may place a cookie on your computer. If you choose to monitor or restrict cookies that are placed on this computer, you can determine the Web site that is attempting to place a cookie. Those cookies are controlled by the content or service provider, and you should refer to that provider's privacy policy for further information regarding its use of cookies and about your options not to accept them.</p>

<p>We may participate in Tacoda Audience Networks (TAN), through which Tacoda Systems, a division of AOL, places a cookie on the user's computer to gather non-personal information about the user, such as the user's browsing behavior and demographic information.

Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with Tacoda or with third-party members of TAN. For more information about how Tacoda uses the information collected by these cookies, please review Tacoda's privacy policy at http://www.platform-a.com/privacy/tacoda. We are not responsible for any actions or policies of Tacoda or of any third-party members of TAN.</p>

<p>In addition, advertisers may elect to use other advertising companies to serve their ads on dealsaver.com, and advertisers themselves may also place a cookie on a user's computer. We do not have access to the cookies or their contents that are placed by advertisers or by third-party advertising companies. We, therefore, recommend that you read the privacy policy of each and every Web site you visit or with which you interact.</p>

Some P3P-enabled browsers may interpret the same P3P code in different ways, while others may interpret P3P code in a manner inconsistent with the original intention. Accordingly, your browser's interpretation of the P3P code should only be considered as a short-hand expression of our privacy practices. This Privacy Policy remains our primary policy, and takes precedence over the P3P code or other privacy principals for all purposes.</p>
