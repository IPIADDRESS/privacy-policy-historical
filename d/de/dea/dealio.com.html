<b>Effective on: October 1, 2004</b><br><br>
These terms are incorporated by reference into Vendio's User Agreement at <a href="http://www.dealio.com/terms.html">http://www.dealio.com/terms.html</a> and are subject to such User Agreement. Your use of any of Vendio's services is subject to the User Agreement in its entirety
<br>
<br>
<b>1.	Background</b>
<ul>
<b>1.1.	TRUSTe Privacy Program. </b>
<a href="https://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.vendio.com" target="_new"><img src="/images/logos/truste.gif" hspace="5" align="left" height="73" width="91" border="0" alt="TRUSTe: Click to Verify"></a>
As a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program, Vendio has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.  By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this web site has agreed to notify you of:

<ol type="1">

	<li>What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identifiable information that is collected from you through the web site</li>
	<li>The organization collecting the information </li>
	<li>How the information is used </li>
	<li>With whom the information may be shared </li>
	<li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information </li>
	<li>The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Vendio's control </li>
	<li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. </li>

</ol><br>
<b>1.2.	Questions. </b> If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Vendio at <a href="mailto:privacy@corp.vendio.com">privacy@corp.vendio.com</a>.  If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe <a href="http://truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php" target="_blank">http://truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.<br><br>
<b>1.3.	Downloadable Software.</b>  The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.
</ul>
<b>2.	Passwords</b><br>
You may not disclose your password to any third party. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information. In addition, you may run the risk of another user accessing your password and using it to falsely represent your identity. If you have reason to believe that your password has been compromised for any reason, Vendio strongly recommends that you immediately change your password. <br>&nbsp;<br>
<b>3.	Information Collected</b>
<ul>
<b>3.1.	Cookies.  </b>We also use cookies on certain pages of our site, and for services requiring registration. This is done primarily for your benefit as cookies allow you to log on only once per session. Most cookies are automatically deleted at the end of a session. In addition, many browsers offer users the option of declining cookies. If you do not wish to accept cookies, please modify the settings in your browser. Your browser must be set to accept cookies if you wish to use the Vendio services available only to registered members. These cookies are not tied to your personal information. <br><br>
<b>3.2.	Information You Provide.  </b>To post messages on our message center or to use any of our other services we may require you to provide us with contact information, such as your name, street address, phone number, and email address. In the event that you are using a paid service we may collect your credit card number, expiration date, and billing information. We may also transmit your credit card to partners, such as universal registration partners, whom you specifically select to receive this information.<br>Additionally, if a friend or associate refers you to Vendio, you have the option to provide their user name during registration so they get credit for the referral.
<br><br>
<b>3.3.	Information We Track.  </b>As you use our services, our servers will automatically track certain information about you in log files. This information includes your IP address, the URL that you just came from, which URL you go to next, which browser you are using, and which operating system you are using. This is not unique to the Vendio website as many existing sites automatically collect this information.  These log files are not linked to your personal information.
</ul>
<b>4.	Disclosure of Information. </b>
<ul>
<b>4.1.	Listing Services. </b> To utilize our auction listing services, or to attach images to an auction, we may request your user name and password for the auction site(s) that you are using. This information is forwarded directly to the auction site for processing. It is not processed or stored by Vendio. <br><br>
<b>4.2.	Referrals.  </b>Users who refer other users under our referral program may view usage data in the aggregate for their referrals.<br><br>
<b>4.3.	Demographic Information.  </b>We aggregate broad demographic and usage information on our user base, which we disclose to our current and prospective advertisers. In addition, this aggregated data is used internally for promotional purposes. We use the information about the interests our users to increase the effectiveness of our marketing and promotional efforts and to customize our site's content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to create a personalized product that better satisfies our users' needs. We may also use information about you to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners. <br><br>
<b>4.4.	Personally Identifiable Information. </b> We do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise share any personally identifiable information about our users to any third party, except with your consent or for the specific purposes described in this statement. If you register for Vendio through a co-branded or private-labeled site, registration information may also be provided to the co-branded or private-labeled site.  This includes, but is not limited to the names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers of our users. You should refer to the privacy policy of the co-branded site to review their data collection and handling policies. In addition, except as we describe here we will not disclose any personally identifiable financial or security related personally identifiable information such as credit card numbers and or passwords. <br><br>
<b>4.5.	Message Center.</b>  If you participate in our message center, your Vendio username will be posted  along with your messages.  Users are also given the opportunity to create a profile that may be viewed by other users. Users are given the option when entering this information to make it viewable by other users or request that it remain private. If the user chooses to opt-in to this option of disclosing their information to third parties or other users, then the user may receive promotional items.  You may later elect to opt-out in accordance with section 9. <br><br>
<b>4.6.	Compelled Disclosure.</b>  Unfortunately, we cannot ensure the absolute privacy of any personally identifiable user information. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to government and/or law enforcement agencies or third parties under certain circumstances. Vendio cooperates with all law enforcement inquiries and reserves the right to reveal your identity (or whatever information we know about you) in the event of a complaint or legal action arising from your use of the services or features on the Vendio website. In addition, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we make it a practice not to disclose any personally identifiable information to any third party, we do not promise that your personally identifiable information or private communications will remain private. 
</ul>
<b>5.	Use of Information</b>
<ul>
<b>5.1.	Log Files. </b> Log files recording the URL that you just came from, which URL you go to next, which browser you are using, and which operating system you are using are used solely for administrative purposes and are not linked to any personally identifiable information. <br><br>
<b>5.2.	IP Addresses.</b>  We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information. Your IP address may be used in order to enforce certain policies within our Terms of Use.   <br><br>
<b>5.3.	Cookies.</b>  Our site uses cookies mainly for the purpose of delivering content specific to your interests, and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you access a registered member only page. Cookies may also be used for other purposes at times.  <br><br>
<b>5.4.	Online Surveys.</b>  Our online surveys at times ask visitors for contact information such as their email address. We use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; please see the Your Ability to Opt-Out section below.  <br><br>
<b>5.5.	Third Parties.</b>  We will disclose your information to third parties or suppliers as necessary to complete your transactions.  For example, during paid transactions we disclose your credit card number to third party processors in order to post the charge to your account.  It is possible that we could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should such a combination occur, you should expect that we would share some or all of your information in order to continue to provide the service. We will notify you should such an event occur in accordance with the procedures outlined in section 11 and will require that the new combined entity follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy with respect to your information.   <br><br>
<b>5.6.	Service Providers.</b>  We use service providers to help us perform some of the services on our site.  When we need to disclose our users' personal information to these vendors, we require that they use the information only for the functions we have asked them to perform in accordance with their privacy policies.  <br><br>
<b>5.7.	Contests.</b>  We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information such as their email address, full name, and street address. We use contact data from our contests to contact our winners and to send users information about our company. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; please see the Your Ability to Opt-Out section below.   Partners who are affiliated with contests may have access to aggregated user data. <br><br>
<b>5.8.	External Service Providers.</b>  This site contains links to many other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. Since Vendio does not control the privacy policies of third parties, such as but not limited to other online auction sites, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies of that third party.  We encourage you to ask questions and review their stated privacy policies before you disclose your personal information to others. <br><br>
<b>5.9.	Advertisements.</b>  We use outside advertising companies to display ads on our site. These advertisements may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads may be collected by the outside advertising companies, and we do not have access to this information.  
</ul>
<b>6.	Editing Personally Identifiable Information. </b><br>
You may at any time review and change your personally identifiable information at Vendio. This information includes but is not limited to your email address, street address, city, state, zip code, country, daytime phone number, password, or credit card number and expiration date. To change this information, the user must log on and click the "preferences" link on the bottom of the Vendio pages. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<b>7.	Message Center </b>
<ul>
<b>7.1.	Personal Information.</b>  This site makes message boards available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in any of these public forums.<br><br>
<b>7.2.	Other Users Information.</b>  In the course of using the services at Vendio you may be exposed to personally identifiable information of other users. Under no circumstances may you disclose personally identifiable information about another user to any third party without the consent of Vendio and the consent of such other user. Vendio does not tolerate spam, and we reserve the right to suspend the registration of any user who sends unsolicited email to our other users. <br><br>
<b>7.3.	Spam.</b>  If you choose to opt-in to allowing other users to view your email address when registering, you should use discretion. While we do not tolerate spam, we are not in a position to control the practices of all of our other visitors. If you believe that you have received unsolicited email from an Vendio user, please notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@corp.vendio.com">privacy@corp.vendio.com</a>.
</ul>
<b>8.	Security</b><br>
Vendio uses industry standard efforts such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. However, even the most robust security systems are not foolproof and users should consider this when revealing any personally identifiable information to any party over any form of media. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<b>9.	Opting Out</b><br>
Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request information about the visitor. However, if a user decides at any time not to receive future communications, the user may remove their information from our database by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@corp.vendio.com">privacy@corp.vendio.com</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>11.	Notification of Changes. </b> <br>
If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a notice on our announcements page notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.<br>
