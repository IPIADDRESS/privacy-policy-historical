<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<div class="bodytxt-medium">May 25th, 2005</div>
<h3 class="ruleDots">Your Privacy</h3>

Shopping.com, Epinions.com, DealTime.com and PriceTool.com (the "Sites") are
brought to you by Shopping.com, Inc. ("Shopping.com").  Shopping.com
believes that trust is an important component of the service we provide
to our customers. To ensure that we earn and keep that trust, Shopping.com
makes every effort to protect your privacy and the confidentiality of your
personal information.  This Privacy Policy is provided to inform you about
Shopping.com's collection, use and disclosure of information you choose
to share with us through the Sites. <p>

This Privacy Policy is considered to be a part of Shopping.com's <a href="/aa17-user_agreement">User
Agreement</a>. By using the Sites you agree
to the terms and conditions of the User Agreement, including
this Privacy Policy. By using the Sites, you are also consenting
to Shopping.com's privacy practices, including the use and disclosure
of any personally identifiable information that you have shared with us,
as described in this Privacy Policy. </p><p>

</p><h3 class="ruleDots">Minor's Privacy</h3>
The Sites are not targeted towards, or intended for use by anyone under the
age of 18.  By using the Sites you represent and warrant that you are 18 years
of age or older.  We reserve the right to terminate your membership in the event
that Shopping.com becomes aware you are under 18. Persons under 18 may not submit
any personally identifiable information to us, and if we discover that we have
inadvertently gathered such information, we will take the appropriate steps to delete it.<p>

</p><h3 class="ruleDots">What Information We Collect</h3>
<b>Information You Give Us.</b> The use of certain features and services on the Sites requires
that you register and supply personally identifiable information such as your name, email
address, telephone number and other information, which is stored by Shopping.com.
When you register as a member of the Sites, we may also collect additional information
from you in order to provide you with those specific services and to personalize your
experience on the Sites.
For example, Epinions.com users may provide more information using features such as Wish Lists,
and that information will be stored with your user profile.<p>

<b>Information Gathered Automatically.</b>  The Sites use "cookies" to automatically recognize returning users.
Cookies used by the Sites may contain your user name, email address, IP address or zip code.
A cookie is a small file on your hard drive that allows us to display your previously defined search
criteria and notification preferences whenever you visit our site. "Clear gifs" are tiny graphics with a
unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and may be used to track the online movements of Web
users or to let us know if you have opened an email that we sent you.</p><p>
Your access provider assigns an internet protocol address to your computer when
you use the Internet. We collect each IP address that accesses the Sites; computer
and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform;
your behavior on the Sites and related services, including the products and merchants you
view or searched for, as well as the URL you come from and go to next; cookie number;
participating merchants you visit and the items that you purchase.
We use this data, as well as other data in our databases, to analyze site and user behavior,
troubleshoot technical problems, resolve disputes, address complaints, prepare aggregated
reports that we share with others and customize your experience on the Sites.

</p><p>You can block cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help),
but doing so may prevent us from delivering certain services to you (e.g., saved searches).
Your browser must also be set to accept cookies in order to access the Sites as a registered member.</p><p>

<b>Other Data Collection.</b>  We may get data from or about you in other ways not specifically
described in this statement. For example, you might contact Community Care or customer support,
or we may get a third party complaint about you. </p><p>

</p><h3 class="ruleDots">Use of Information by Shopping.com</h3>
Information you provide to us through the Sites is used by Shopping.com to operate the Sites,
provide you with information and services you request, and to communicate with you.
We may, for example, use information you provide to target ads that we think you may
be interested in, or send emails to you including newsletters and alerts.
Your information may also be used to contact you when necessary
(such as to assist you in your use of the Sites). You may always choose not to provide
us with this information; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service.
You may opt-out of receiving future mailings at any time (see the Choice/Opt-Out section below);
however, you may not opt-out of some administrative emails (such as emails about User
Agreement changes or communications about Eroyalties or rebates earned in the Shopping.com Cash Back Program)
while you are a member with one or more of our Sites.<p>

</p><h3 class="ruleDots">Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h3>

<b>Aggregated Research Data.</b>  Shopping.com produces research reports and other information
and data about online shopping for participating merchants, and other customers, as well
as media and other interested parties.  Such information and data are based on aggregated,
anonymous information about millions on online shoppers and do not include any personally
identifiable information about individuals.  <p>

<b>Co-Branded Services.</b>
Shopping.com usually saves information that it collects
from users and shares this information with certain partners in order to provide services to users.
In order to use certain services on the Sites, it may be necessary for you to enter information that
then goes to our partner. The areas of the Sites in which partners are collecting information may
be co-branded with our partners' logos. In these cases, the partner's use of user data is governed
by their privacy policies, not ours. Shopping.com may receive a copy of such information from these
partners, subject to the privacy policies of such partners. If you have questions regarding the privacy
policy or data collection practices of one of our business partners, please contact that partner directly.
Shopping.com does not have control over and is not responsible for the data collection and use practices
of our business partners.</p><p>

<b>Partners.</b>
 When you register as a member of the Sites, we will automatically enroll you in the Shopping.com Smart
Shopper Club. Administration of this program may require that we share some of your personal data with
one or more of our partners.  </p><p>

<b>Special Offers.</b>
 On the Sites, you may also have opportunities to express interest in or register for
third party products and services. If you do, we will provide data about you to the third
party to implement your request.  For example, in the Shopping.com Cash-Back Program
(a service of the Smart Shopper Club) we work with Ebates.com and they may collect information
on you such as your name, address, email address or telephone number.  For more about Ebates.com's
practices and your options regarding their data collection and use, see <a href="http://www.ebates.com/privacy.jsp">Ebates.com's Privacy
Policy</a>.</p><p>

<b>Advertisers.</b>
 We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Sites.
These companies may use information about your visits to the Sites in order to provide
advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. When we do this, we do not provide
your name, address, email address or telephone number.  </p><p>

Third party ad servers (including DoubleClick) may place or recognize a cookie and, using
the cookie or otherwise, collect and use data from your visits to the Sites and other websites
to serve ads to you.  For more about DoubleClick's practices and your options regarding their
data collection and use, see
<a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/">DoubleClick's Privacy Policy</a>.</p><p>

<b>Other.</b>
 We may share your information with our affiliates, consultants, vendors and service providers,
who assist us in maintaining the Sites and providing related services such as online registration
for events.  For example, we currently use a third party service provider to send Eroyalties
redemption checks and rebate checks earned by participation in the Shopping.com Cash Back Program.
In addition, Category Leads may have access to some or all of our Epinions databases.
For more information about Category Leads, see <a href="http://www.epinions.com/help/faq/?show=faq_recognition">Epinions' FAQs</a></p><p>

<b>Other Disclosures.</b>
 In addition, we may share data with any parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and other companies
under a common control or acquirers. As our business evolves, Shopping.com may sell, transfer or otherwise
share some or all of its assets, including personally identifiable information, in connection with a merger,
reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy.  In such an event, personal and anonymous
information may be one of the assets transferred.</p><p>
We may disclose information when required by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is
necessary in order to conform to applicable law, comply with legal process served on Shopping.com, or to
protect the property or interests of Shopping.com, its agents and employees, personal safety, or the public.
Under such circumstances, Shopping.com may be prohibited by law, court order or other legal process from
providing notice of the disclosure, and Shopping.com reserves the right not to provide such notice in its sole discretion.

</p><h3 class="ruleDots">Other Use and Disclosure of Information for the Sites</h3>
<b>Content and Ratings.</b>
 You can publish reviews, comments and other content. Members can choose to rate
products or reviews, and to create a web of trust. As an unregistered visitor, we may allow you to rate products and/or reviews.<p>

Your review ratings and trust statements are displayed publicly unless you change the default configuration.
Your member name is automatically displayed with reviews and comments you publish, and if other members choose to,
they can receive email notifications of your publications or publish their own comments to your reviews.</p><p>

We, and our licensees, can republish your content as described in our User Agreement. We publish product
ratings and use them to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views and merchandise products. We use
your review ratings and web of trust to personalize site views and identify/feature popular members.
For example, we may promote most popular or highest-earning reviews and members. While we don't expect to
transfer the complete review rating and web of trust database to others (except as contemplated elsewhere in this Policy),
we use the database throughout our network and to generate results for others.</p><p>

<b>Eroyalties Redemptions.</b>
 To request your Eroyalties redemption, you may need to provide additional
data about yourself. We use your mailing address to communicate about your redemption and, in some cases,
other issues. We do not disclose your social security number to third parties except as required by law
or as otherwise contemplated by this Policy.  Epinions reports redemptions to the IRS as required by law
(including filing an IRS Form 1099 for redemptions over $600 in a calendar year). Any other data required
for redemption may be appended to our records about you and treated like our other business records.</p><p>

<b>Email Tools.</b>  If you send emails through our site, your email will include your email address and
any personal message you include. Although we do not retain, in any easily-retrievable way, the addresses
that you are emailing, these emails are not private communications. Also, you may not use these tools to
send spam or content that violates the User Agreement.</p><p>

<b>Leads/Advisors/Top Reviewers.</b>  While you are a Category Lead, Advisor or Top Reviewer, we may contact you.
For more information, see <a href="http://www.epinions.com/help/faq/?show=faq_recognition">Epinions' FAQs</a>.</p><p>

<b>Feedback.</b>  We may ask for your feedback through a survey, and we may use the results for our internal
development and marketing research.  We may also share the results with our affiliates, consultants, vendors
and service providers.</p><p>

</p><h3 class="ruleDots">Links to Other Sites</h3>
The Sites contain links to other web sites. Shopping.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or
the content of these sites. If you have concerns about how other web sites collect and use information
about you, make sure to read that site's own privacy policy.<p>

</p><h3 class="ruleDots">Changing or Deleting Information About You</h3>
Registered members may update or edit personal information or delete their membership account by
accessing their Member Profile or Account information.  We try to implement changes to our databases as
quickly as possible.  However, not all databases may be updated immediately, and some old data may remain
in our archives and records. Also, we may be unable to send changes you make to partners, vendors or third
party service providers who have already received your data or content. If your account or membership
is being terminated or suspended, we may maintain some data to prevent re-registration.<p>

We will retain in our files information you have requested to delete in some circumstances, such
as to REsolve disputes, analyze programs and enforce our User Agreement.  Furthermore, such prior
information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints,
including stored "back up" systems.</p><p>

</p><h3 class="ruleDots">Choice/Opt-Out of Shopping.com Email Communications</h3>
At any time (and except for administrative emails discussed above), you have the ability to opt-out of
receiving communications from Shopping.com and our partners. To unsubscribe from the Shopping.com email
newsletter, contact <a href="/aa24-contact_cs">Customer Support</a>
