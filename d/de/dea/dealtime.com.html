It governs your participation on the eBayCommerceNetwork.com, Shopping.com and DealTime.com websites (including the versions of these sites in foreign jurisdictions), their sister sites, and all co-branded versions of these sites or any successor brand that eBay may designate from time to time in its discretion (in the United States or foreign jurisdictions), which are referred to collectively as the "eBay Commerce Network" or "ECN," along with their related sites, applications, services, and tools, regardless of how you access or use them, including through mobile devices. </p>

We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it can no longer be used, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify a specific person. </p>
