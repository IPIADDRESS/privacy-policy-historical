<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Thank you for visiting the Dearfoams.com website.  We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the privacy of any personally identifiable information that we may collect 
from you as you use the Dearfoams.com website.  This Privacy Policy is intended to describe for you, as an individual who is a user of the Dearfoams.com website or our services, the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures.  By visiting the Dearfoams.com website, you are confirming your agreement to our privacy policies as described in this Privacy Policy.  We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using the Dearfoams.com website or our services or transacting business with us.  You should also review our <a href="/info/terms.jsp" title="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a> for more information about the policies governing your use of the Dearfoams.com website.
</p>

<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>
We may collect and store personally identifiable information on certain areas of the Dearfoams.com website when users register, purchase products or services, request information or a response, 
sign up for events, apply for jobs, or participate in user posting areas, such as bulletin boards, discussion forums and surveys.  Such personally identifiable information may include your name, address, age, date of birth, sex, company or school affiliations, education level, e-mail address, driver's license number, telephone numbers, information about your interests and activities and your reviews of our website or products that we sell.  If you transact business with us, such personally identifiable information may also include financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information).  You may elect not to provide certain types of information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of the Dearfoams.com website.  We may combine the personally identifiable information that we receive from you through the Dearfoams.com website with information from other sources.
</p>
<p>
We may also collect and store personally identifiable about other people that you provide to us.  If you use the Dearfoams.com website to send others (friends, relatives, colleagues, etc.) a product as a gift, information that may interest them or messages (such as invitations) through our system, we may store your personal information, and the personal information of each such recipient.
</p>
<p>
We may also automatically collect and store certain types of information when you visit the Dearfoams.com website.  For example, we may use "cookies" to obtain information when 
you access the Dearfoams.com website.  Such information may include your IP address, the type of browser you are using, the date and time of your visit, the operating system of your computer and the domain name of your Internet service provider and is used to facilitate access to the Dearfoams.com website and to personalize your on-line experience.  Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them.  We recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better shopping experience.  Utilities are available from third parties to help you visit websites anonymously, but use of such utilities may also result in you being unable to use certain features of the Dearfoams.com website.
</p>
<p>
We may use standard Internet technology, such as Web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of the Dearfoams.com website.  We may also include Web beacons in 
e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.  The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer visitors 
to the Dearfoams.com website to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our on-line advertising and content or other activities.
</p>
<p>  
We may allow third parties, including our authorized service providers, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on the Dearfoams.com website.  These 
companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements.  This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness.  The Dearfoams.com website does not provide any personal information to these third parties.

</p>
<p>
We will not share any personally identifiable information that you provide to us except (i) for the purposes that you provided it to us, (ii) with us or others from injury or loss, or (iii) 
with other persons or entities with whom we contract to provide services in connection with the Dearfoams.com website or our other business activities.  If we do share personally identifiable information with a third party, we will, to the extent practical, require that the recipient protect such information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, but we cannot guarantee how such a third party will use personally identifiable information.  Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies that describe how they use and disclose personal information.  Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy.  If you want to learn more about the privacy practices of those third parties, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties.  These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.

<p>
We may provide links on the Dearfoams.com website to websites of third parties as a service to users of the Dearfoams.com website.  In addition, some of the content 
appearing to be on the Dearfoams.com website may in fact be supplied by third parties.

</p>
<p>
</p><h3>Your Choices Regarding Personal Information</h3>

We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure.  For example, only

We may provide areas on the Dearfoams.com website where you can post information including reviews of products.

In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting.  Also, whenever you voluntarily 
disclose personal information on publicly-viewable Web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others.  For example, if you post your e-mail address, you may receive unsolicited messages.  We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.  Once you have posted information, you will not be able to edit or delete such information.
