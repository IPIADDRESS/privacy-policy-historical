DealNation.com takes your privacy seriously, and has created this Privacy Policy
in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to online privacy. Keep reading to
learn more about our information gathering and dissemination practices, and our
use of personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>
IP Addresses<br>
<br>
We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our site or web
server, and for the general administration of our website. Your IP address,
should you decide to register and/or create a DealNation account, is also used
to help prevent you from creating duplicate accounts.<br>
<br>
Cookies<br>
<br>
Upon your first visit to this web site, a "cookie" is sent to your computer. A
cookie is a tiny file that identifies you as a unique user. It stores personal
preferences and user data; however, in no way does this tell us who you are.
DealNation.com has two primary uses for its cookies.<br>
<br>
First, we use cookies to track special offers and promotions that may be
presented to you as you navigate our website. This is done so that you are not
presented with the same special offers and/or promotions over and over, or after
you have indicated you are not interested.<br>
<br>
Secondly, we use cookies as part of our authentication system when you login to
your account. If you select the "remember me" option when logging in, our site
will set a cookie so that you do not have to login again the next time you visit
DealNation.com.<br>
<br>
While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to this
site always have the option of disabling cookies in their web browser. Most
browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to
refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.<br>
<br>
Information Gathering<br>
<br>
This web site collects online contact information in various ways, including
inquiry forms, registration forms, surveys, and contests. The information
collected may be used to send the user information about our company, or to get
in touch with the user when necessary. Emails may come from DealNation.com.<br>
<br>
Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the opt-out/modify section
below.<br>
<br>
Information Dissemination<br>
<br>
We may use the personal information that you supply to us and we may work with
other third party businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our
members via email. These businesses may include providers of direct marketing
services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement,
suppression and validation and email marketing.<br>
<br>
Links to Other Sites<br>
<br>
DealNation.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the
privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our
partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through
our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.
For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a
frame of content that is actually created or hosted by a third party.<br>
<br>
Also, via our site you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information,
websites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties.
DealNation.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third
parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties
when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.<br>
<br>
Children Under 13<br>
<br>
DealNation.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable
Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we
discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of
this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe
DealNation.com has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact
us.<br>
<br>
Security<br>
<br>
This web site has security measures in place to protect against loss, misuse
and/or alteration of the information that you provide. Furthermore, we have
taken every precaution technically possible to prevent any unauthorized access
to the contents of this web server.<br>
<br>
Opt-Out/Modify<br>
<br>
DealNation.com provides every user with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
future communications from us, change and modify information previously
provided, or remove their information from our databases altogether. You may do
so in any of the following ways: <br>
