                      Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific End User. 
                      When you engage in certain activities on the Website, such as creating an 
                      account, ordering a product or service from us or our partners, submitting 
                      content and/or posting content in discussion forums, entering a contest, filling

                      provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and 
                      last name, mailing address (including post code), email address, telephone number and 
                      date of birth (although we will generally only require an email address and name). 
                      When you order products or services, we may also ask you to provide 
                      us with your credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related

                      is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not provide 
                      the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not

                      feedback to tell others about our services, and may post your comment in our
