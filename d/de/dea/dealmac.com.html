            <p>The policies below are applicable to deal-mac.com, deal-iMac.com,
            and deal-pc.com, published by Danrich Internet LLC (Danrich),
            P.O. Box 11901, Huntsville, AL 35814, email <a href="mailto:privacy@deal-mac.com">privacy@deal-mac.com</a>.</p>

            <p>Danrich respects each individual user's right to privacy.
            Danrich Internet LLC does not collect personal identifying information
            unless such information is specifically and knowingly provided
            from users during contests, surveys, sweepstakes, site registration,
            or use of public areas, such as a forum. Danrich may use aggregate
            forms of this information <font size="-1">--</font> not individual
            data <font size="-1">--</font> for marketing and promotional
            purposes. Danrich does not supply identifying information to
            other companies, or uses such information for its own purposes
            including but not limited to email newsletters, unless the user
            "opts-in" for such purposes by specifically allowing
            usage. (Identifying information must necessarily be used when
            notifying a user of requested information, such as notification
            of a winning entry in a contest or sweepstakes.) Danrich is not
            responsible for any actions or policies of such companies.</p>

            <p>Danrich uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information
            disclosed to us secure. However, Danrich is not responsible for
            any breach of security. If a Danrich user knowingly provides
            personal information, such as a name or email address, in a forum
            or other public service, that user should be aware that the information
            provided can be collected and used by third parties. Such activities
            are beyond the control of Danrich.</p>

            <p>Non-personal information and data may be automatically collected
            through the standard operation of Danrich's Internet servers
            or through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small
            text files a web site places on your computer's hard drive to
            recognize repeat users and facilitate the user's use of the site.
            Also, cookies allow a site to track usage behavior and compile
            aggregate data for content improvement, targeted advertising,
            and marketing and promotional purposes. Users should be aware
            that Danrich cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting
            information by advertisers or other third parties. Most browsers
            allow a user to deny cookies; however, users should note that
            cookies may be required to provide certain web site features.</p>

            <p>ATTENTION KIDS: No information should be submitted to Danrich
            by children under 18 years of age without their parent's or guardian's
            consent. Danrich does not monitor the age of its user audience.</p>

            <p>The foregoing policies are effective as of January 3, 1999.
            Danrich reserves the right to change this policy at any time
            by posting notice of the existence of a new privacy statement.
            This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended
            to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in
            or on behalf of any party.
