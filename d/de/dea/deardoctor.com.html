From time to time, with your knowledge and consent, Dear Doctor collects personally identifiable information such as a name, postal address, E-mail address, telephone number, or credit card information.
<br><br>
<span class="legalbold">Use of Personal Information</span>  
<br><br>
Dear Doctor retains certain personally identifying information that is supplied by our Web site visitors.  If you choose to give us personally identifying information at such time, such information will be retained by us and used only to provide you with products or services you have requested, or with additional information from Dear Doctor about Dear Doctor, its affiliates, or selected outside service providers whose products or services we feel may be of use to you. Any information from selected service providers will be transmitted by Dear Doctor so that the service providers will not have access either to your E-mail address or to your other personally identifying information, unless you provide them this information directly. We will not sell or rent any personally identifying information obtained through the Web site to any other company or service provider.
<br><br>
If, at some point after giving Dear Doctor your personally identifying information, you do not wish to continue to receive additional information from Dear Doctor, its affiliates, or selected outside companies, in general, you may opt out by E-mailing optout@deardoctor.com and put the words "remove my name" in the subject line of your E-mail; in the case of our E-mail newsletters, you also may follow the procedures at our E-mail newsletter registration page. 
<br><br>
From time to time, the personally identifying information that you provide to us may be shared with our suppliers or service providers who assist us in maintaining and managing our newsletters, our archives, our online content, our online discussion forums, and other activities on the Web site. Such suppliers or service providers may use your personally identifying information only in the course of providing services to Dear Doctor, but they may not use such information for other purposes.
<br><br>
While your individual information is protected as discussed above, Dear Doctor reserves the right to use such individual information to create aggregated, anonymous data about users in order to develop statistics about activity on and visitors to the Web site. In addition, Dear Doctor may disclose personal information if we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Web site; or (4) protect the personal safety, property, or rights of our users or the public.
<br><br>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<span class="legalbold">Cookies &amp; IP Information</span>
<br><br>
"Cookies" are pieces of information that are placed by a Web site in a storage place on your computer. Cookies do not contain information that is, in itself, personally identifying. Cookies may be placed on your computer in a limited way to help deliver advertisements, to calculate unique site visitors, and to track usage throughout our site. Other uses include placement of cookies to make the login process more convenient for users of our E-mail newsletters, our archives, our online content, and our online discussion forums. In addition, some advertisers may place cookies on your computer. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.

<br><br>
When you use our site, we may also collect your browser type, access time, and/or Internet Protocol ("IP") address, and keep records of this information. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell us who you are. Like the IP address, none of this other information identifies you personally; we collect it for aggregate reporting on site activity that we, and our advertisers, may use.  The aggregate information helps to understand our audience and confirm the value of the advertising on our website.
<br><br>
<span class="legalbold">Credit Card Information</span>
<br><br> 
When you make a purchase, we ask you to provide your credit card information so that we can process your payment. During the ordering process, such credit card information is transmitted to Dear Doctor or to one of our suppliers or service providers.

<br><br>
<span class="legalbold">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</span>
<br><br>

If you believe the Web site has any information about anyone under 13, please contact us at webmaster@deardoctor.com.
<br><br>
<span class="legalbold">Security</span>
<br><br>

And, of course, any information you include in a message you post to any message board, discussion group, or other public posting area on our sites is available to anyone with Internet access.
