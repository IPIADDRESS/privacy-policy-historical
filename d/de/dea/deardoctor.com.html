<br>
<h3 class="ddwc_paragraph_heading">Web Site Users</h3>

<p>From time to time, with your knowledge and consent, Dear Doctor collects personally identifiable information such as a name, postal address, E-mail address, telephone number, or credit card information.</p>

<h3 class="ddwc_paragraph_heading">Use of Personal Information</h3>  

<p>Dear Doctor retains certain personally identifying information that is supplied by our Web site visitors.  If you choose to give us personally identifying information at such time, such information will be retained by us and used only to provide you with products or services you have requested, or with additional information from Dear Doctor about Dear Doctor, its affiliates, or selected outside service providers whose products or services we feel may be of use to you. Any information from selected service providers will be transmitted by Dear Doctor so that the service providers will not have access either to your E-mail address or to your other personally identifying information, unless you provide them this information directly. We will not sell or rent any personally identifying information obtained through the Web site to any other company or service provider.</p>

<p>If, at some point after giving Dear Doctor your personally identifying information, you do not wish to continue to receive additional information from Dear Doctor, its affiliates, or selected outside companies, in general, you may opt out by E-mailing optout@deardoctor.com and put the words "remove my name" in the subject line of your E-mail; in the case of our E-mail newsletters, you also may follow the procedures at our E-mail newsletter registration page.</p>

<p>From time to time, the personally identifying information that you provide to us may be shared with our suppliers or service providers who assist us in maintaining and managing our newsletters, our archives, our online content, our online discussion forums, and other activities on the Web site. Such suppliers or service providers may use your personally identifying information only in the course of providing services to Dear Doctor, but they may not use such information for other purposes.</p>

<p>While your individual information is protected as discussed above, Dear Doctor reserves the right to use such individual information to create aggregated, anonymous data about users in order to develop statistics about activity on and visitors to the Web site. In addition, Dear Doctor may disclose personal information if we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Web site; or (4) protect the personal safety, property, or rights of our users or the public.</p>

<h3 class="ddwc_paragraph_heading">Contests</h3>
<p>From time to time, we also may offer contests or other promotions involving marketing or advertising partners. If you choose to participate in one of these contests or promotions, you'll have to provide some personally identifying information about yourself.  We use this information to verify eligibility and to notify winners. We may share this information with co-sponsors of the contest or other promotional partners. We do not control these third parties' privacy practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to their collection and use of personal information. We urge you to review their privacy policies and learn how they will use the information before participating. If you don't want us to collect the information requested in the promotion, or to provide it to our co-sponsors or partners, please do not participate in the contest or promotion.</p>

<h3 class="ddwc_paragraph_heading">Cookies &amp; IP Information</h3>
<p>"Cookies" are pieces of information that are placed by a Web site in a storage place on your computer. Cookies do not contain information that is, in itself, personally identifying. Cookies may be placed on your computer in a limited way to help deliver advertisements, to calculate unique site visitors, and to track usage throughout our site. Other uses include placement of cookies to make the login process more convenient for users of our E-mail newsletters, our archives, our online content, and our online discussion forums. In addition, some advertisers may place cookies on your computer. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.  If you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of various features on our site that are available to other visitors.</p>

<p>When you use our site, we may also collect your browser type, access time, and/or Internet Protocol ("IP") address, and keep records of this information. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell us who you are. Like the IP address, none of this other information identifies you personally; we collect it for aggregate reporting on site activity that we, and our advertisers, may use.  The aggregate information helps to understand our audience and confirm the value of the advertising on our website.</p>

<h3 class="ddwc_paragraph_heading">Credit Card Information</h3>
<p>When you make a purchase, we ask you to provide your credit card information so that we can process your payment. During the ordering process, such credit card information is transmitted to Dear Doctor or to one of our suppliers or service providers. In both cases, credit card information is then transmitted to third-party credit card processors and card issuers that must use your information to process your order.</p>

<h3 class="ddwc_paragraph_heading">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
<p>No one under the age of 13 should provide any personal information. Dear Doctor does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 without verified parental consent prior to collection. In the event that we learn that we have collected information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete this information from our database as quickly as possible. If you believe the Web site has any information about anyone under 13, please contact us at webmaster@deardoctor.com.</p>

<h3 class="ddwc_paragraph_heading">Security</h3>
<p>The personally identifiable information we collect is securely stored within our database, and we use standard, industry-wide procedures such as encryption and firewalls for protecting your information. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a message you post to any message board, discussion group, or other public posting area on our sites is available to anyone with Internet access.</p>

<h3 class="ddwc_paragraph_heading">Unauthorized Use/Hacking</h3>
<p>Dear Doctor's Web site and system are made available for lawful activities by authorized users only. Any person using the site without authority or for any unlawful activity are subject to having his or her activities monitored, recorded, investigated, examined and/or disclosed by or to Dear Doctor and its agents, and law enforcement. Dear Doctor may also monitor, record and disclose the activities of authorized users.</p>

<h3 class="ddwc_paragraph_heading">Modifications</h3>
<p>Dear Doctor reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the site or any of the services offered therein following any such posting will constitute your acceptance of all changes.</p>
