<strong>PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT</strong><br>
<br>
This web site is owned and operated by DealSaving.com (DealSaving
or we). DealSaving takes user privacy seriously and makes
reasonable efforts to protect your privacy. We have created this
Privacy Policy in order to share with you our information
collection and use practices. Please read this policy carefully
before sharing any personally identifiable information described
below. This policy applies solely to the web site and service
located at www.DealSaving.com (the Service).<br>
<br>
<strong>Collection of Personally Identifiable
Information</strong><br>
<br>
In order to use certain portions of the Service, you may be asked
for, or you may choose to provide, certain personally identifiable
information (PII) such as name, email address, postal address,
PayPal account and similar information. We will not collect PII
from you while you use the Service unless you voluntarily provide
it to us or authorize us to collection such information.<br>
<br>
You authorize DealSaving to receive any account information from
any affiliated merchant including, but not limited to, information
regarding any purchase made by you through utilization of the
Service, such as: the products ordered, the order number, the time
and date of the purchase, the email address entered for the
purchase.<br>
<br>
<strong>Collection on Non-Personally Identifiable
Information</strong><br>
<br>
DealSaving does collect and track certain non-personally
identifiable (non-PII) information, including but not limited to,
user IP numbers and browser type, access times, domain names, usage
habits and other information which does not specifically identify
any individual.<br>
<br>
“Cookies” are pieces of information that may be placed on your
computer by a web site for the purpose of facilitating and
enhancing your communication and interaction with that web site. We
may use cookies to customize your use of the Service and for other
purposes to improve your use of the Service, and may also use web
beacons, web bugs, action tags and third party cookies. You may
stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or flush
them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences,
in which case you may still use our Service, but it may interfere
with some of its functionality. We do not use cookies to
automatically retrieve PII from your computer without your
knowledge.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
<br>
DealSaving may use or disclose PII to operate and manage the
Service, to provide services that you have requested or respond to
your other inquires or requests. We may also disclose PII in the
establishment or exercise of legal rights or defense against legal
claims, to comply with applicable laws or regulations, to comply
with a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or
court order or to investigate suspected fraud or a violation of the
terms of the DealSaving User Agreement.<br>
<br>
We will never sell your Personal Information to any third party not
affiliated with DealSaving without your consent, except in
connection with the sale or merger of DealSaving or the division
responsible for such services.<br>
<br>
You should be aware that PII which you voluntarily include and
transmit online, such as in online forums, may be viewed and used
by anyone with access to such forums. DealSaving is unable to
control such uses of your PII.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
<br>
We may use and disclose non-PII for any number of reasons,
including but not limited to, working with business partners and
improving our Service.<br>
<br>
<strong>Security</strong><br>
<br>
The security of your PII is very important to us and we take
commercially reasonable steps to attempt to secure your PII. We
have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial
procedures to safeguard the information we collect. Only those
employees and contractors who need access to your PII in order to
perform their duties are authorized to have access. However, due to
the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that
communications between you and DealSaving or information stored or
transmitted through the Service or on our servers, will be
completely free from unauthorized access by third parties such as
hackers, and your use of the Service demonstrates your assumption
of this risk.<br>
<br>
<strong>No Children under 13</strong><br>
<br>
We have no intention of collecting PII from children under the age
of 13. When we become aware that PII from a child under 13 has been
collected without such child’s parent or guardian’s consent, we
will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our
database.<br>
<br>
<strong>Changes in Privacy Policy</strong><br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. DealSaving will
post those changes on this page.<br>
<br>
<strong>User Agreement</strong><br>
<br>
Use of this Service is subject to the DealSaving User Agreement
located at http://www.DealSaving.com/terms-conditions/.<br>
<br>
<strong>United States</strong><br>
<br>
Our Service is maintained from within the United States of America.
If you are located outside of the United States, by using the
Service, you authorize the export of PII to the United States and
its storage and use as specified in this policy.<br>
<br>
