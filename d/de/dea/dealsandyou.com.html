We have tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you are not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these under key terms section (as provided below) first.

           <h3>Information we collect</h3>
           <p>We collect two types of information about our Website Users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non- Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
           
            <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
            <p>
            	"Personally Identifiable Information" is information that identifies a specific End User when such End User engages in certain activities on the Website/Webpage, such as creating an account, ordering a product or service through the Website, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums, entering a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by us or our partners, filling out a survey, posting a review, sending us or our partners feedback, requesting information about our services, submitting an affiliate agreement, applying for a job, posting a video or signing up for special offers from third parties through the Website/Webpage (collectively, "Identification Activities"), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, telephone number and date of birth. When you order products or services, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            	We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide products and services to you, administer sweepstakes and contests, enhance the operation of the Website, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website use, improve our product and service offerings, and to tailor your experience with third parties as provided in Section titled "Use of Collected Information" of this Privacy Policy. For example, if you send our customer service an e-mail we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about our services, and may post your comment in our marketing materials or on our Website. In addition, if you use our Website to send information or a product to another person, we may store your personal information, and the personal information of any recipient. We may use that other person's contact information to allow him or her to view and accept your gift or to allow the recipient to access the information you requested we send. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
            <p>
            	Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific End User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are using and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Pixel tags, as described in the Section titled "Key Terms" of this Privacy Policy.

            <h3>Uses of Collected Information</h3>
            
            <p>
            	We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website, analyse trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content and programming. When you contact us, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing.

            <h3> Release of Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
            <p>
            	We do not share personally identifiable information with other parties except as provided below: As a part of the normal operations. For example, when you download a coupon/coupon code, we share your mobile number with companies, organizations or individuals outside of the Company ("Third Parties"). Similarly, we might have to send some of the Personally Identifiable Information like your name to Third Parties. For all other purposes, we will only share Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties if you engage in an Identification Activity. Please note that we will only provide Third Parties your information with an opt-in notice to you, in which you will have a chance to choose that the Company should not give the Third Parties your personal information. We specifically disclaim any responsibility or liability for the actions of such Third Parties. While we inform them that they are only permitted to communicate with you for the purposes of the specific promotion in relation to the Company, we do not have any responsibility for the actions of the Third Parties, and the actions of the Third Parties are not in our control.
            </p>
            <p>
            	We may share your information with Authorized Third Party Service Providers. We provide some of our services and products through third parties. These "Third Party Service Providers" perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing our administrative and promotional emails. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, deliver packages, send postal or email, administer contests or sweepstakes, remove repetitive information on customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, process credit card payments, operate the Website, troubleshoot, and provide customer service. We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies ("Affiliates") with whom we have business relationships and may have to also share their information with Service Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. For example, when you order a service, we release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for the service and, if applicable, release your address to the delivery service to deliver the service. Likewise, we may release an Affiliate's information to our bank to send out a payment. We encourage Third Parties and Third Party Service Providers to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control. We may share your information in a Business Transfer. As with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy. We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection of Others. We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or a court order; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Website Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of the Website, its Users or others. We may share your information with our associate companies. We may also share Personal Identifiable Information with our associate companies for the purpose of providing any notification regarding new services or special promotional programs and offers or information related to such associate companies if you have opted-in. Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.
