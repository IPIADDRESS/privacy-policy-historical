	<div class="text-content pull-left">
		<p><strong>DealsOnWheels.com&nbsp;respects the privacy of visitors to our website.This Privacy Statement
		applies only to information collected online through the DealsOnWheels.com website and does not describe
		the ways in which we may collect or use information obtained offline or through any means other than our
		website. Please read this Privacy Statement carefully so that you understand what information we collect
		through our website and what we do with that information. If you have any questions about this Privacy
		Statement, please&nbsp;contact us at privacy@autotrader.com.</strong></p>

		<h3 id="informationWeCollect" class="no-margin">1. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

		<p>The information we gather generally falls into two categories: (1) information supplied by visitors
		to the website when they list a vehicle for sale, perform a search, enter a sweepstakes or other
		promotional contest, or inquire about a vehicle listed for sale or about another product or service
		offered through our website, register to access certain services on our websites, or use our discussion
		forums, photo or video sharing pages, email services or social networking features; and (2) information
		we collect as visitors use our website.</p>

		<p>Third-party providers involved in the operation of the website (including, but not limited to, vendors
		of products and services and providers of widgets, tools, and applications) featured on or linked to by
		our website may also collect information about you. Their collection and use of this information will
		be subject to their privacy policies.</p>

		<p><strong>Communicating with us</strong><br>
		If you find a listing that interests you and elect to send the seller an email through our website, we
		will share with the seller the contact information you supply through our online "Email this Seller"
		form. Some dealerships that list vehicles for sale on our website use third-party service providers
		to manage their "leads" (that is, the inquiries they receive from consumers who are interested in the
		vehicles they've listed for sale). If a dealership has designated a provider of lead management
		services, we may also share with that provider any information you elect to send to the dealership
		through our "Email this Seller" form.  If you do not wish to share your email address or other contact
		information with sellers who advertise on our website or lead management service providers, you should
		not use our "Email this Seller" contact form.</p>

		<p>Many of the dealership listings that appear on our website include toll-free telephone numbers that
		can be used to contact the dealership that is selling the advertised vehicle. If you call a dealership
		using one of these toll-free numbers, we (or a service provider acting on our behalf) may provide the
		dealership with the date, time, and duration of your call, as well as the number from which your call
		originated and an audio recording of your call.</p>

		<p>You may sign up for or use certain products, services and tools on our website that require or permit
		you to provide information about yourself, such as your name, physical address, email address and phone
		number. For example, you may provide such information if you sign up for our newsletters, complete our
		“Feedback” form or use a social media or interactive tool.  We may use such information in order to
		provide you with the products, services or tools you have requested.</p>

		<p>When you list a vehicle for sale, we ask for information on the vehicle and on how you can be
		contacted by potential buyers (including information like your phone number and email address). We
		also ask for your credit card number and the expiration date on your card. We use this information to
		create your ad and to process your payment (please see the section on “Use and Disclosure of Information”
		below for more information about how we use and secure credit card information). We may also use
		information you submit to us in connection with your purchase of that listing, including your name and
		location, on third-party sites and mobile applications where we distribute or promote your listing.</p>

		<p>In addition to the above, we may collect information, and/or use the information we collect, in the
		following specific ways:</p>
		
		<p><strong>Searches and Listings</strong><br>
		To make use of certain features on our website, visitors need to provide limited
		information about themselves and their interests so that we can tailor the information we provide to their
		needs. For example, to help you find the vehicle you want close to home, we need to know what kind of
		vehicle you are looking for and your zip code. We ask you to provide this information when you perform a
		search. We use this information to help you find the vehicle you are looking for or as otherwise described
		in this Privacy Statement.</p>

		<p><strong>Sweepstakes and Other Promotions</strong><br>
		From time to time, we may offer sweepstakes or other promotions on our
		website. If you enter a sweepstakes or promotional contest, we will ask you to provide information about
		yourself (such as your name, phone number, address, date of birth, and email address). Among other things,
		we will use this information to contact you if you win, and we may also use this information for marketing
		purposes. We may share this information with any co-sponsor of the contest or sweepstakes; we will identify
		the co-sponsor in the contest rules. We may also share this information with shipping or fulfillment
		companies or other third-party service providers that help administer our promotions, such as by conducting
		drawings, and/or delivering prizes to winners. If you do not want us to collect the information requested
		in the contest or sweepstakes registration form or to provide it to co-sponsors, please do not enter the
		contest or sweepstakes.</p>

		<p><strong>Online Surveys</strong><br>
		From time to time, we survey our users to measure their satisfaction with our website and other sites and
		to help us learn more about our audience and how they interact with our website. Third-party research firms
		often conduct these surveys on our behalf. We use the survey results to help us improve the services we
		offer to you. Except in the circumstances described below in the "Other Disclosures" section of this policy,
		we will not share, without your consent, any personally-identifying information you submit in response to a
		DealsOnWheels.com survey with any company other than the research firm conducting the survey. We will,
		however, take the information you provide and aggregate it on an anonymous basis with data collected from
		other survey participants. We may use and disclose that pool of anonymous information as we see fit,
		without identifying you personally.</p>

		<p>You may also find on our website invitations to participate in surveys conducted by our advertisers,
		whose privacy practices we do not control. These invitations will usually link to an online survey form
		that is hosted either by the advertiser conducting the survey or by a third-party research firm working
		on the advertiser's behalf. When you access an advertiser's survey through our website, the use and
		disclosure of any information you submit will be governed by the advertiser's privacy policy (or by the
		privacy policy of the advertiser's research firm), which may differ from ours. If you cannot find the
		applicable privacy policy via a link either from the advertiser's survey invitation or from the online
		survey form, you should contact the advertiser directly for more information.</p>

		<p><strong>Email Addresses</strong><br>
		We may use your email address to respond to requests you make for our products or services or to respond
		to your communications with us. We may also contact you to inquire about your experience on our website,
		to provide you with information about our products and services available from us or from our affiliates
		or to communicate to you information related to the automotive industry.  From time to time, we may also
		send you emails that include special promotions and other commercial offers that we think may be of interest
		to you. We hope you will find these communications informative and useful. If you do not, you can
		unsubscribe from any of our commercial email programs by following the simple instructions included in an
		email you receive in connection with that program.</p>

		<p><strong>Social Networks</strong><br>
		When you use one of the social network sharing tools available on our website, we and the
		social network operating the tool may collect information about you based on such use. The social network’s
		use of that information will be subject to its own privacy policy, which may be different from this
		Privacy Statement.</p>

		<p><strong>Content You Post to our Website</strong><br>
		If you choose to post content to any of the interactive areas of our website, such as discussion forums,
		comments fields and social media areas, please keep in mind that the information you post can be seen,
		collected and used by anyone who has access to those areas.&nbsp;You may also have the opportunity from time to
		time to respond to questions that we display to users of the website. If you choose to respond, your response
		may be published on an area of the website accessible to other users or the public. We are not responsible
		for any third-party use of such information.</p>

		<h3 id="cookies" class="no-margin">2. COOKIES AND OTHER DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES</h3>

		<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
		To help us tailor our website, and the tools and applications on our website, to the needs and interests
		of our visitors, we keep track of visitor interactions with our website through the use of cookies. Cookies
		are small text files stored on your browser when you use websites and applications. The “Help” function on
		most web browsers contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie
		or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you do not accept cookies, you will not be able to take advantage
		of some features on our website that are available to other visitors. We use cookies to improve the user
		experience on our website by making it more responsive to the needs of our users, and to make it easier for
		us to recognize you when you return to our website. We also use cookies to analyze website performance
		and to measure advertising performance.</p>

		<p><strong>Web Beacons</strong><br>
		To help us (and in some cases our advertisers and third-party providers) keep track of how many users are
		accessing particular pages or listings within our website, and to track how users respond to ads we place on
		third-party websites, we may place a small file, called a web beacon, on some of our pages and on some of
		the listings and ads we distribute.</p>
		
		<p>We may also place a web beacon in the emails we send to you.  When you open one of our emails or click
		on links within these emails, we track this click-through data to help us determine your interest in
		particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our communications to you. If you prefer not to be
		tracked in this way, you should not open these emails or click text or graphic links in the emails.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Information about Your Computer or Device</strong><br>
		Our web server (and/or any web server operated by our service provider(s) on our behalf) automatically
		collects and may store limited information about your computer configuration when you visit our website,
		including the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running, the resolution of
		your computer monitor, and your IP address. Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by
		computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you
		want to view) can be transmitted to you. We also use IP address information for systems administration
		(including fraud detection and prevention) and troubleshooting purposes. We may also collect information
		about the website you were visiting before you came to our website and the website you visit after you
		leave our website.</p>

		<p><strong>Combined Technology Information</strong><br>
		Cookies, beacons, information collected about your computer or device, and other data collection
		technologies (“Data Technologies”) may be used individually or in combination in order to provide and/or
		administer our services, to help us understand user behavior, to monitor website performance, optimize ads
		and measure advertising performance.</p>

		<p><strong>Website Analytics</strong><br>
		We may collect, or have a third party collect on our behalf, data on how visitors use and navigate
		through the Websites, such as the number of users who visit various pages within the Websites, what
		they click on, whether they scroll up or down on particular pages, fill out forms, etc.  We use this
		information to improve the Websites and learn about users, and may disclose it to our affiliates
		(including, among others, the members of the AutoTrader Group, Inc. corporate family), or to third
		parties.</p>

		<p><strong>Advertising</strong><br>
		DealsOnWheels.com has relationships with certain third-party advertising networks, Advertisers,
		and advertising services ("Advertising Services") that collect data, target and serve some of the
		advertisements, promotions, or other marketing messages you see on our website and other websites
		and mobile applications, including websites owned and/or operated by our affiliates.</p>

		<p>Such Advertising Services may, including through processes that we do not control, use Data
		Technologies from third party companies to collect data from your activities on these websites,
		on other websites owned and/or operated by our affiliates, or with other websites. These technologies
		may be used to track user behavior, how our products and services are offered, conduct consumer 
		esearch and possibly to serve you relevant ads and content. These companies may also obtain information,
		including personally identifiable information, from services you use from other companies, including
		without limitation, other websites, mobile websites or applications, and combine the information they
		obtain through these Data Technologies with information obtained through our products and services.
		Their collection and use of this data is subject to their own privacy policies. See “Use and
		Disclosure of Information” below for more information on opt out options.</p>

		<h3 id="useAndDisclosure" class="no-margin">3. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h3>

		<p><strong>Ad Serving and Targeting</strong>
		We (or a service provider acting on our behalf), our Advertising Services, our advertisers, and/or
		our third-party providers may use clickstream data collected using cookies, beacons, and/or browser
		level information to help us tailor the content of advertising, marketing, and promotional messages
		(including, but not limited to, landing pages) on this and other websites and mobile applications to
		the perceived interests of our users.</p>

		<p>For example, if you've been viewing pages related to SUVs on our website, you are more likely to
		see ads about certain SUVs on our website and other websites.  This clickstream data does not identify
		you personally and does not include your name, address, email address or telephone number, but it may
		include the IP address of your computer.</p>

		<p><strong>Our Participation in the Industry Self Regulatory Program for Interest Based Ads; Additional Choice Options</strong><br>
		DealsOnWheels.com supports the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising from the
		Digital Advertising Alliance, which regulates the practices relating to the collection of clickstream
		data. To opt out of our interest-based advertising program or to learn more about our data collection
		practices, please visit our AdChoices page, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info">www.aboutads.info</a>
		or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.evidon.com">www.evidon.com</a>. Pages of our website that collect information
		that may be used by such advertising partners for interest-based advertising purposes are identified
		by a link to AdChoices on the page.</p>

		<p>When we present information to our advertisers - to help them understand our audience and confirm
		the value of advertising on our website - it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic
		to various pages within our website.</p>

		<p>In some cases, to provide you with a customized experience and to enhance our services, we (or third
		party service providers acting on our behalf) may combine information (including personally identifying
		information) that we collect through our website with information about you and/or your computer from
		other sources, including offline interactions with us, public databases, and third parties.</p> 

		<p>We may share this information with our affiliates, including AutoTrader Group, Inc. and any of their
		subsidiaries, so that we and they may provide you with information, products, and services that we
		believe may be of interest to you.</p>

		<p>Any credit card information you may provide to us is secured during transmission over the Internet
		using industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption (See "Security," below.) We use your credit
		card information only to bill you for the products and services you order from us and to help detect and
		prevent fraud.  We do not share your credit card information with anyone, except as may be necessary to
		process your transactions, detect and/or prevent fraud, or comply with law.</p>

		<h3 id="linksAndFeatures" class="no-margin">4. LINKS AND FEATURES OFFERED</h3>

		<p>To make our Websites more valuable to our visitors, we feature some products and services that come
		from third parties. We share with these third parties information to help them provide the products or
		services, whether requested by you or a third party. Our Websites may link to websites of such third
		parties, which are not governed by this Privacy Statement. Our finance, insurance, transportation, and
		inspection services, for example, are made available through cooperative arrangements with companies
		that specialize in providing such services. When you access another website or purchase products or
		services or conduct other transactions through our Websites, use of any information you provide is
		governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the website you are visiting or the provider of such
		products or services. When you provide information in the course of obtaining products or services
		through our Websites, use of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy policy of the
		third-party provider of those products or services.  If you cannot find the privacy policy of any of
		the third-party providers via a link either from their website's homepage or from the pages on which
		the products or services are offered, you should contact the third-party provider directly for more
		information.</p>

		<h3 id="otherDisclosures" class="no-margin">5. OTHER DISCLOSURES</h3>

		<p>We may release or use information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with laws;
		to respond to legal process or to a valid law enforcement request; to enforce our Visitor Agreement; or
		to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our website, our customers, the public or
		DealsOnWheels.com. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that
		DealsOnWheels.com, one of its business units, or substantially all of its assets is acquired by another
		company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred assets.</p>

		<p>If you choose to unsubscribe in response to an email message that we send on behalf of an advertiser,
		we will share your email address and opt-out instructions with the advertiser. Similarly, if we ask a
		third-party company to send its customers email offers on our behalf, we will share with that company
		(or its agent) a list of email addresses collected from website visitors who have opted out of our
		email program.</p>

		<p>We may allow others to search some of our databases (our listings database, for example) and to analyze
		the data they find there or aggregate it with other data, either for their business purposes, or ours.
		Though some of the information in our databases may be personally identifying (such as the contact
		information included in a vehicle listing), we will only allow searches of the portions of our database
		that contain information that is otherwise publicly available on our website.</p>

		<p>When we use other companies to help us operate our website or improve the services we offer to you,
		we may provide them with information about our visitors that is necessary for them to perform their
		services. We require that these companies commit to use the information only to perform the services
		that we request.</p>

		<h3 id="security" class="no-margin">6. SECURITY</h3>

		<p>DealsOnWheels.com takes commercially reasonable steps to ensure information we gather on our website
		is stored in a secure manner. Any credit card information you may provide us is secured for transmission
		over the Internet using industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. While we work hard to
		protect your privacy, no physical or electronic security system is impenetrable, or invulnerable to attack,
		including your own, and the ones used to transmit your data to us. We cannot and do not guarantee that
		our systems, or your information, will be secure. Any information you include in an actual vehicle
		listing is publicly available on the website and viewable by anyone with Internet access.</p>

		<h3 id="internationalVisitors" class="no-margin">7. INTERNATIONAL VISITORS</h3>

		<p>This website is intended for use by visitors within the United States. If you reside outside the United
		States, please be aware that (i) our databases are stored on servers and storage devices located in the
		United States, (ii) your information (including personal data) may be transferred to the United States
		for processing and storage, and (iii) the United States, and the localities within the United States where
		our databases are located, may not guarantee the same level of protection for personal data as the locality
