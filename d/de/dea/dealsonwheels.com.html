		<p>Data Technologies.  Various technologies are used to automatically collect information, such as cookies, local shared objects, and web beacons (generally referred to as “Data Technologies”. “Cookies” are small identifiers sent from a web server that are stored on your device for the purpose of identifying your browser or storing information or settings in your browser.  “Local shared objects,” sometimes known as Flash cookies, may be used to store your preferences or display content based upon what you have viewed on various websites to personalize your visit.  A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies.  Anonymous advertising identifiers are increasingly being used on mobile devices and otherwise in a manner similar to cookies.  When we refer to Data Technologies, we are including all current and similar future technologies.</p>

		<p>One or more Data Technologies may be used on the AutoTrader Sites and other websites and mobile applications (that may not be the AutoTrader Sites) by us, by another party on our behalf, or by third parties in accordance with their privacy policies.  Data Technologies may be used by us and others, on our behalf and on their own behalf, to transmit information to you or about you and connect information about you from different sources, websites, devices, and mobile applications.</p>  

		<p>We may use a uniquely generated trackable toll-free telephone number on dealer sites or in advertisements.&nbsp;If you call one of these uniquely generated toll-free numbers, we (or a service provider acting on our behalf) may collect non-personally identifiable information about the call (e.g. date, time, duration), as well as personally identifiable information (e.g. your name, the number from which your call originated).</p>

		<p>Videos We may target and track the videos you view on the Sites. You consent to our tracking of your video viewing through the Site or third party social media for up to two years or as permitted by applicable law.</p>

		<p>Location Information.  When you download or use the AutoTrader Sites, we may collect physical location information that is sufficiently precise to allow us to locate a specific person or device (“Location Information”). We only collect Location Information with your permission (e.g., such as when you agree to provide it to us after you initially access or download the AutoTrader Sites).  We may use Location Information and provide it to third parties to provide you with content and services that are relevant to a particular location, such as advertising, search results, dealers in the area, and directions.</p>

		<p>Publicly Posted Information.  Information that you make available to us and others via social media networks, forums, blogs, list serves, chat rooms or similar functionality is public information that we or others may share or use in accordance with the law.</p>

		<p>Combined Information and Information from Other Sources.  We may combine information that you provide to us with information we receive from our affiliates and other sources, as well as with other information that is automatically collected.&nbsp; The combined information may include information about your use of the Sites, your use of other websites, devices and mobile applications and information from our affiliates and other sources.</p>

		<h3 id="howWeMayUseTheInformationWeCollect">How We May Use the Information We Collect</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>1.	for everyday business purposes, such as establishing and managing your user account, providing products and services you request, processing and collecting payments and providing customer support;</li>
			<li>2.	to create listings and advertisements for any cars and other vehicles that you list for sale with us.  These lists and advertisements may appear on the AutoTrader Sites and other websites, mobile applications or services of third parties;</li>

		</ul>

		<h3 id="applicationsWidgetsAndSocialMedia">Applications, Widgets and Social Media</h3>

		<p>We may include applications or widgets from social media providers that allow interaction or content sharing by their users.  These widgets, such as a Facebook “Share” or “Like” button, are visible to you on the web page you visit.  Integration between the AutoTrader Sites and social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter and others may allow social media networks in which you participate to collect information about you, even when you do not explicitly activate the network’s application or widget.  Please visit the applicable social media network’s privacy policy to better understand their data collection practices and choices they make available to you.  The privacy policy of the social media network controls the collection, use and disclosure of all personal information transmitted to that network.</p>

		<h3 id="advertisingNetworks">Advertising Networks</h3>

		<p>Advertising that is customized based on predictions generated over time from your visits across different websites, devices and mobile applications is sometimes called "online behavioral" or "interest-based" advertising.  We may partner with advertising networks, which are companies that deliver targeted advertisements to consumers and generate statistics and metrics related to the delivery of interest-based advertisements.  They may utilize information collected through a variety of Data Technologies to provide customization, auditing, research and reporting for us, our affiliates and other advertisers.  This data collection takes place both on the AutoTrader Sites and on third-party’s websites and mobile applications.  This process allows AutoTrader and third parties to deliver targeted advertising, enhance marketing programs and help track the effectiveness of such efforts.  Our advertising networks also may use this information for determining or predicting the characteristics and preferences of their respective advertising audiences and measuring the effectiveness of their advertising in accordance with their privacy policies.</p>

		<p>We do not provide information that is directly associated with a specific person (such as name and address) to an advertising network when you interact with or view a customized advertisement.  However, when you view or interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may make an assumption that you are interested in the subject matter of the advertisement.</p>

		<p>Some companies disclose when they are using interest-based advertising programs on the AutoTrader Sites to deliver third-party ads or collecting information about your visit for these purposes and give you the ability to opt-out of this use of your information.  You may see an icon  in or around third-party advertisements on the AutoTrader Sites that use interest-based advertising programs and on pages where data is collected and used for online interest-based advertising.  Clicking on this icon will provide additional information about the companies and data practices that were used to deliver the ad.  You can opt out of delivery of targeted advertising to you by multiple companies by visiting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.evidon.com">www.evidon.com</a>.  Please note that even if you opt out, you will continue to receive advertisements, but they will not be tailored to your specific interests.</p>

			<li>5.	Sellers, Dealers and Manufacturers.

We may share your application information with the dealership(s) you selected and our financial partners so that they can process your application and otherwise use it in accordance with their privacy policies, however, we will not use your personal financial information for interest based advertising.</li>
			<li>7.	Corporate and Asset Transactions.  If we sell all or substantially all of our business or sell or transfer all or a material part of our assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a substantial part of our business, we may transfer all information we have collected and stored, including personal information, to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.</li>
