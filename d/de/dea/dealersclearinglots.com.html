                        1. Information DealersClearingLots.com Collects and How We Use It</h3>
                    <p>
                        Personal information collected on our Website is used to improve the content of
                        our Website, customize the content or layout of our Website for individual users,
                        provide services requested, notify users of updates to the Website, respond to any
                        questions, problems or complaints, or request feedback and, subject to the limitations
                        set forth below, to develop new products and services and to contact consumers for
                        marketing purposes.</p>
                    <p>
                        DealersClearingLots.com collects email addresses of consumers who communicate with us or through
                        our authorized vendors via email. We also collect information about web pages visited
                        (See <a href="#cookies">Cookies and Web Beacons</a> below) and other information
                        that is provided by consumers either on our Website or in response to email communications
                        from us.</p>
                    <p>
                        We also collect information provided to us by consumers in purchase requests submitted
                        through our Website or our authorized vendors' websites ("<strong>Purchase Request Information</strong>").
                        Purchase Request Information typically includes name, address, and phone numbers,
                        email address and specific vehicle information.</p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, consumers who express a desire to apply for vehicle financing provide
                        us with and authorize us or third parties with which we have a business relationship
                        to obtain from third parties necessary financial information such as credit reports
                        ("<strong>Finance Information</strong>"). Finance Information typically includes
                        name, address, and phone numbers, email address, age, occupation, income, social
                        security number and other credit related data.</p>
                    <p>
                        We do not provide financing, but instead transmit those requests to third-party
                        vendors for consideration.</p>
                    <p>
                        We may also collect other types of information during registration or in connection
                        with your other activities on our Website, such as demographic information and information
                        about or contained in postings you make in forums, blogs or any other interactive
                        areas of our Website; your answers to surveys, your participation in sweepstakes,
                        contests, games and promotional offers; and in any email request you send us for
                        any reason (such as to request customer service or provide us with comments or feedback).</p>
                    <p>
                        All information provided by consumers in any of the above-listed ways or otherwise

                        Framed Sections of Our Website</h3>
                    <p>
                        DealersClearingLots.com maintains relationships with outside service providers for
                        some of the products and services offered on our Website. Certain of these providers
                        are found on our Finance, Insurance, Warranty or other pages. The information these

                        DealersClearingLots.com border will surround the pages served by the service providers, or by
                        directly linking the user to the vendors' websites. In either case, the provider
                        is prominently identified. Please be aware that any information you provide on such
                        pages is provided directly to those providers and is subject to their security and
                        privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these outside
                        providers because their privacy policy and practices may differ from ours. Our content
                        may be displayed on or through third-party websites through the use of inline frames
                        or other framing techniques. We may collect personal information in such framed
                        pages or content located on or provided by third-party websites. When you submit
                        personal information to us in this manner, it is treated as personal information
                        under this Policy. The collection and use of personal information by the third-party
                        website directly (i.e., outside of our content framed pages) is governed separately
                        by the privacy policy of those websites.</p>

                        <li>To provide you with services or products that you have requested;</li>

                            and</li>
                        <li>On occasion, and only as permitted and described below under <a href="#decline">
                            Your Right To Decline Communications From Us and Others</a>, to other third parties

                        or other harm to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure

                    <h3>
                        Purchase Request Information and Finance Information</h3>
                    <p>
                        Purchase Request Information is used to transmit to third parties requests for products
                        or services and to contact consumers regarding vehicles. Similarly, Finance Information
                        is used to transmit third party requests for vehicle financing. Typically, in either
                        case the information is transmitted to dealers, manufacturers, lenders or fulfillment
                        entities, as applicable, who may be in a position to respond to your request. As
                        part of the request process, we may verify the information you provide, or obtain
                        omitted address or other contact or demographic information, from third parties.</p>
                    <p>
                        Occasionally, in the case of Purchase Request Information or Finance Information,
                        when DealersClearingLots.com does not have a dealership or lender available to assist
                        you, we may forward your request information to a manufacturer or another referral
                        service for transmission to a dealer or lender. Your submission of the request authorizes
                        us to do this. Any Purchase Request Information or Finance Information forwarded
                        in this way becomes subject to the security and privacy policies that are posted
                        on the websites of those third parties.</p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, Purchase Request or Finance Information transmitted to a dealer, manufacturer,
                        lender or fulfillment entity becomes the property of that dealer, manufacturer,
                        lender or fulfillment entity, in addition to DealersClearingLots.com. The information
                        is used to process your request and to provide you with information about goods
                        and services. Any request to opt-out of future dealer, lender, manufacturer or other
                        third-party communications must be made directly to that third party.</p>
