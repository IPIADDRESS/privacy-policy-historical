<p><b>OTHER INFORMATION</b></p>

<p><b>Other Information We May Collect</b></p>

<p>We and our third-party service providers may collect Other Information (defined above), such as:</p> 

<p>•	Browser information<br>
•	Server log files<br>
•	Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies<br>
•	Demographic information and other non-personally identifiable information provided by you<br>
•	Aggregated information</p>

<p><b>How We May Collect Other Information</b></p>

<p>We and our third-party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:</p>  

<p>•	<b>Through your browser or your device</b>:  Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system version and Internet browser type and version.  We and our service providers may also collect a unique device identifier assigned to the device from which you are accessing the Site (UDID) and other transactional information for the device that we and our service providers may use to serve content to the device.</p>

<p>•	<b>Through server log files</b>:  An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer or other device that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.  We and our service providers use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems and administering the Site.</p>  

<p>•	<b>Using cookies</b>:  We and our service providers may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Stored Objects (“<b>Flash LSOs</b>”)) and other similar technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information, facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Site, and collect and store information about your use of the Site.  For example, pixel tags and web beacons may be used in connection with certain Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, track the actions of Site users and email recipients, measure the success of marketing campaigns and compile statistics about Site usage and response rates.</p> 

<p></p><center>o	If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies.  To learn more about cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>.  If you choose to decline cookies, then some or all of the features, functionality and promotions available through the Site may not be available to you.<br>  
o	If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained using the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html" target="_blank">Website Storage Settings Panel</a>. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html" target="_blank">Global Storage Settings Panel</a> and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without you being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).  Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Site or our online content. We expect our service providers and technology suppliers to honor any decision by you to restrict or limit Flash LSOs, but we cannot guarantee that they will do so.<br>  
o	The use of these technologies allows our third-party vendors to deliver advertisements about our products and services when you visit the Site or other websites or web properties across the Internet. These vendors may place so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar technologies on the Site and other websites across the Internet, and also place or recognize third-party cookies when you visit the Site or other websites or web properties. These vendors may use information about your visits to the Site and other websites or web properties (excluding your name, address, email address and telephone number) to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank>www.networkadvertising.org</a> or the Digital Advertising Alliance at <a href=" http:="" www.aboutads.info="" "="">www.aboutads.info</a>.</center><p></p>

<p>•	<b>From you</b>:  We may collect demographic information, such as your location, as well as Other Information, such as your preferred means of communication, when you voluntarily provide this information to us.  Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site.</p>

<p>•	<b>By aggregating information</b>:  We may aggregate Personal Information so that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who like a particular artist.  Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site.</p>

<p><b>How We May Use and Disclose Other Information</b></p>

<p>Because Other Information does not personally identify you, we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose.  In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location); if we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is so combined.</p>

<p><b>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS</b></p>

<p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Site.  Please note that these companies may use information about your visit to the Site to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.  In the course of serving advertisements to the Site, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.  If you would like more information about this practice, and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy" target="_blank">http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy</a> or <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>.</p>   

<p><b>SECURITY</b></p>

<p>We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information under our control.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  We seek to strike a balance between the security of your data and your convenience.  As a result, we may use a method of communication that is less secure than other, less convenient alternatives.  For example, we may transmit data in unencrypted form.  If you are concerned that your information may be transmitted over the Internet in unencrypted form, please do not provide us with any such information.  You acknowledge and agree that any information you transmit through the Site is so transmitted at your own risk.  If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the “<i>Contacting Us</i>” section below.</p>
