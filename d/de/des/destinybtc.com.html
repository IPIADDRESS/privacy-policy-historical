        <p class="text-justify">A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a medium of exchange using cryptography
          to secure the transactions and to control the creation of new units. Cryptocurrencies
          are a subset of alternative currencies, or specifically of digital currencies.
          Bitcoin became the first decentralized cryptocurrency in 2009. Since then,
          numerous cryptocurrencies have been created. These are frequently called
          altcoins, as a blend of bitcoin alternative. Cryptocurrencies typically
          feature decentralized control (as opposed to a centralized electronic money
          system, such as PayPal) and a public ledger (such as bitcoin's block chain)
          which records transactions.</p>
