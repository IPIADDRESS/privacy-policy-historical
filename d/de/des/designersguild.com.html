            <p><strong>The Information We Need and How We Use It </strong><br>
              The Information We Need and How We Use It When you order, we will
              require your name, e-mail address, credit / debit card number and
              card expiry date. Without this information we will not be able to
              process your request or notify you of acceptance of your order.
            </p>
            <p>A contact telephone number may also be required so that we may
              contact your urgently if there is a problem with your order. We
              may, unless you advise us otherwise, pass this information to our
              couriers or other agents in case they need to contact you to arrange
              the processing or delivery of your order. </p>
            <p>When you register with us you can select whether you would like
              to be sent notification of special orders, promotions and other
              correspondence from us via email. If you would like to receive these
              notifications please select the tick box on the registration form
              which is on the Order Confirmation page. If you leave the box unchecked
              you will not receive these notifications. If, in the past, you have
              chosen to be notified and you no longer wish to receive mailings
              from us please send an email and we will remove your email address
              from our records. </p>
            <p><strong>Safety and Security Of Your Information </strong><br>
              Our site uses secure server software to protect your information
              whenever you place an order or access your account information.
              This software encrypts all information you input before it is sent
              to us to minimise the risk of this being intercepted before it is
              received by us. We also follow a tight security procedure as required
              under UK Data Protection Legislation (the Data Protection Act 1998)
              to protect the information that we store about you from unauthorised
              access. </p>
            <p>We may wish to pass your details to trusted third-parties that
              we believe may be of interest to you. If you would prefer not to
              enjoy this service then please tick the box on the My Account page
              or during the registration process. </p>
            <p><strong>Internal Confidentiality Within The Designers Guild </strong><br>
              Within The Designers Guild we protect your privacy in 4 ways:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Access to Customer account information is limited to those who
                need access for the performance of their job. </li>
              <li>We use full login and password controls on our sales control
                system. </li>
              <li>All full and part-time employees are required to sign a confidentiality
                clause as part of their terms of employment with the company.</li>
              <li>Confidentiality and database access controls are reviewed periodically
                and updated as required to further protect your personal data.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Your Rights </strong><br>
              If, for any reason, you are unsure about the personal and account
              information we are holding in your name, please contact our customer
              service team. They will happily review your file and update the
              records if required. You can contact our customer service team by
              email, phone or fax. Alternatively, this information can be checked
              and reviewed online once you have signed in. </p>
            <p><strong>Use of 'Cookies' </strong><br>
              Our cookies do not contain any personal information about you and
              are used only to determine your browser and user preferences for
              our site. We believe that this can greatly assist us in providing
              you with the service that you desire and to enhance your browsing
              experience. However, if you prefer, your browser software should
              enable you not to accept cookies. You should still be able to use
              our site without cookies enabled. </p>
            <p><strong>Consent </strong><br>
           Your use of this website signifies your consent to the collection,
              processing and use of personal information by us for the purpose
              of administering and dealing with your order or account, market
              research, processing your payments, credit reference checking and
              fraud detection, and for marketing purposes as outlined above. Any
              changes to our privacy policy will be posted on this site so that
              you may ensure that you are fully informed of your rights and can
              notify us of any changes to your preferences. We do track the visits
              that people make to our site so that we can see which pages are
              the most and least visited. </p>
            <p>This allows us to make informed changes to the website which enhances
              your experience. However we have no idea of who you are or any of
              your personal details as all the tracking is anonymous. We keep
              track of how many people use this website and which sections are
              most popular - that's so we can improve the service we offer and
              make sure that all parts of the site are working. But don't worry,
              we're not spying! Our data doesn't tell us who you are, just how
              many people have visited the site!<br>
