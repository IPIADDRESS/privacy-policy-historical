<h2 style="font-family: arial; font-size: 25px;">Use  of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Java Script</h2>
<p class="style1"><a name="4" id="4"></a><strong><em><u>Cookies:</u></em></strong> "Cookies" are a feature in your browser  software. If enabled, we may write cookies that may store small amounts of data  on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this Site. Cookies  assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what  content you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this site again,  cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences.  We may use cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to this site;  accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on website usage;  deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing  history.  You can disable cookies, although the Site  may not function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be modified to  accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set.  You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use  all of the features and functionality of Company's websites, you need to accept  cookies. <br><br>
  We  predominately use "session" cookies, which are not permanently stored on your  hard drive. Session cookies expire after two hours of inactivity or when you  close your browser. When you carry out the purchase of a service or product on  our website, a large amount of data is processed by our system and transferred  through each page of the search or registration. This information includes all  information you input on a registration page or  questionnaire you complete as part of the registration  process as well as demographic information that is not unique to you. "Session"  cookies allow us to keep track of this data until you have completed your  search or registration. <br><br>
  We may  use "persistent" cookies primarily to ensure that we do not show you pages that  you have already seen and to personalize your site experience and save you  time. "Persistent" Cookies enable us to recognize whether you have responded to  any questionnaire or registration or have already been presented with an advertisement  or information placed on the site so that we do not show you the same  information again the next time you visit our site. The "persistent" cookies we  use will remain on your computer after you have left our site and will expire  when you log out of the Site or 60 days after your last visit for security cookies, 90 days after your last  visit for payment tracking cookies, or two years after your last visit for advertisement  cookies.<br><br>
  We may  also allow other companies to display advertisements to you while you are  visiting our Sites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements  from the other companies' servers, these companies can view, edit or set their  own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. We have no  control over the practices of those third party advertisers and are not  responsible for their technology or tracking.  We encourage you to review the policies of  such advertisers when you link to their website.<br><br>
  <em><u>Removing Cookies:</u></em>You  have the ability to accept, decline or move cookies at any time by modifying  your browser settings. Please see http://cookiecentral.com. If you choose to  decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact  your experience on the web site.<br><br>
  <a name="5" id="5"></a><strong><em><u>Web Beacons</u></em><u>: </u></strong>   We also use electronic images known as Web  beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs, clear gifs or action tags) that  allow us to collect certain information about your visit to these Web pages  (including the number of users who have visited those pages), measure and  improve the effectiveness of advertisements, and deliver services. Web beacons  are not used to access your personally identifiable information; they are a  technique used to compile aggregated statistics about web site usage. Web  beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number,  time and date of page view and a description of the page on which the Web  beacon resides. This information may be shared with one or more third parties so  that they can understand the kinds of visitors to the Web pages, how those  visitors use those Web Pages, and the effectiveness of their advertisements. WE  may also use web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in our  database.<br><br>
  <em><u>Disabling Web Beacons.</u></em>Because  Web beacons are the same as any other content request, you cannot opt out or  refuse them. However, they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of  cookies or changing the cookie setup in your browser.<br><br>
  <strong><em><u>JavaScript:</u></em></strong> We may also use JavaScript within  certain advertisements. JavaScript is a computer language that enhances the  functionality of websites, particularly in respect to pictures. We do not  collecting any personal data via JavaScript but use it to analyze and improve  the site's functions. <br><br>
  <em><u>Disabling JavaScript:</u></em>You  may deactivate JavaScript via your browser settings or activate it the same  way. If you disable JavaScript you will not be able to use some of the  functions of the website.<br><br>
  <em><u>IP  Addresses. </u></em> We automatically track certain information  based upon your behavior on the site. We may use this information to do  internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better  understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may  include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or  not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site or not), your  computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol  ("IP") is a unique Internet "address" which is assigned to  you by your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area network  ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently  assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web  servers, collecting information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP  address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation  of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP  address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or  which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses,  and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.<br><br>
  <em><u>Computer  Profiles. </u></em> Company may also collect and accumulate other  anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience  of our visitors. For instance, Company may accumulate visitor data relating to  referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software,  screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings,  cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you  provide us with Personal Identification Information, we are able to use such  visitor data to identify you. </p>

SSL  encrypts information, including credit card numbers, names and addresses as  they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that, although We  take commercially reasonable technological precautions to protect your data, no  data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Therefore, We cannot and do not warrant that your information will be  absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through this site is at your  own risk. However, access to your information is strictly limited, and not  accessible to the public.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: arial; font-size: 25px;">Changes  to Privacy Statement</h2>
<p class="style1">We  reserve the right to make material changes to the substance of this Privacy  Statement.  We will post those changes  through a prominent notice on the web site so that you will always know what  information we gather, how we might use that information, and to whom we will  disclose it.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: arial; font-size: 25px;">Your  California  Rights</h2>
<p class="style1">A California resident who has provided personal information  to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for  personal, family, or household purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request  information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to  any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general,  if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon  receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to  provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed  in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal  information that were disclosed.<br><br>
  However,  under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists  if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a  policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third parties for  their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees  to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy.  Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his  or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost  free means to exercise that right.<br><br>
  As  stated in this policy, you have agreed to allow us to share information with  third parties for their direct marketing purposes until you remove your  information and thus, agreement for such disclosure. To prevent disclosure of  your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not  opt in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one  of our sites or contact us via email to remove your information from our  database. Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications  from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's  privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to  use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we  have no control over how third parties use information. You should always  review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to  determine how that entity will handle your information.<br><br>
  California customers may request further  information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing privacy@desktoplightning.com.  Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer  each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other  than through this e-mail address.</p>
