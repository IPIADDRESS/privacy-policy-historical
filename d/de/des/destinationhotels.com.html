<p><strong>This initial summary of our Privacy Policy highlights some important points regarding collection and sharing of your information and third parties who may set cookies and collect information through Destination Services.&nbsp; Please review our full Privacy Policy below before using the Destination Services.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Use of Information</strong>: We primarily use the information we collect through the Destination Services in connection with your use of the Destination Services and to communicate with you regarding news, special offers and other information. Click <a href="#about">here</a> for more details.</li>
    <li><strong>Sharing of Information</strong>: We may share the information we collect through the Destination Services with our vendors and third party business and marketing partners, including companies who sponsor and offer sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions through the Destination Services. We may also share information about you for legal and business reasons. Click <a href="@infoshare">here</a> for more details. If you are a California Resident, you may request additional information; please click <a href="#cali">here</a> for more details.</li>
    <li><strong>Third Parties Collecting Information Through the Services</strong>: The Destination Services may contain content served by third parties, including videos and advertisements, and we work with third party service providers to serve advertisements on the Destination Services and elsewhere online. In connection with providing content and services, third parties may collect certain information about you and your visits to this or other web sites and we may receive information regarding the use of the Destination Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. These advertising networks, advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers and other vendors may set and access their own tracking devices (including <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> and <a href="#beacons">web beacons</a>) and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you and your online browsing activities. Click <a href="#InfoThirdParty">here</a> for additional information, including regarding certain opt-out choices available to you.</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong><a name="Info">INFORMATION COLLECTION</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a name="Registration">1. Registration and Other Information You Provide</a></strong></p>
<p>
The Destination Services may collect "Personal Information" (information that identifies you as a specific individual, such as your full name or e-mail address), account information (password or other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your account) and demographic or other information (such as your ZIP code and information about your interests and preferences). If we combine demographic or similar information with the Personal Information we collect, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The Destination Services are general audience services and are not intended for individuals younger than the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from individuals younger than the age of 13 through our online services. If Destination discovers that it has inadvertently collected personal information online from anyone younger than the age of 13, we will use commercial reasonable efforts to delete that information.</p>
<p><strong><a name="InfoThirdParty">2. Information Third Parties Provide About You</a> </strong></p>
<p>
We may receive information about you from third parties. We may combine this information in our database and we may use it to offer you products or services, or for similar purposes. We also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties. If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through the Destination Services, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.</p>
<p><strong><a name="SMIntegrate">3. Social Media/Integration With Third Party Platforms</a></strong></p>
<p>The Destination Services may permit you to interact with a third party site or service, such as enabling you to "like" us on another site or "share" content from Destination Services with other sites (a “Social Networking Service”). If you choose to "like" or "share" content or to otherwise post information from or via the Destination Services to a Social Networking Service, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Destination Services. Similarly, if you interact with us through a Social Networking Service, we may have access to information about you (for example, if you "like" or "follow" our page on a third party site).&nbsp; Please note that if you mention or comment upon Destination or the Destination Services in your post to a third party platform, the third party platform may allow us to publish your post on the Destination Services.</p>
<p>
You may also choose to use a social media tool offered by a third party, but available on Destination Services (such as posting a review or logging into the Destination Services with your username and password for another site). Use of such a feature may allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information. When you choose to use a social media tool available on a Destination Service, you may be opting to link your activities on the Destination Services with a third party site or service. That third party may collect information about your visits to the Destination Services and may publish that activity to your profile or similar feature on that third party site. The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party site.</p>
<p>
To manage the information Destination may receive about you from a Social Networking Service, you will need to follow the instructions provided by the Social Networking Service. Once Destination receives your information from a Social Networking Service, that information is stored and used by Destination in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong><a name="usercontent">4. User Content</a></strong></p>
<p>The Destination Services may provide you the opportunity to post content publicly through interactive features. You may choose, through such features or otherwise, to submit or post reviews, comments, photographs, audio files, video files, and suggestions related to the Destination Services or otherwise post free form comments (collectively, “User Content”). Please note that certain information, such as your name and state of residence, and a link to any website URL you provide may be publicly displayed by the Destination Services along with your User Content. However, Destination will not publish your e-mail address or other contact information with these comments.</p>
<p>Note that any User Content you post is public – others will have access to your User Content and may read, see, use, and/or share it with third parties. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information in your User Content, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply. If you submit User Content, it may be published online or offline (including through the Destination Services, on-air, in a DVD, or any other format currently existing or later developed). In addition, we may use your User Content and any excerpt from your User Content in connection with our advertising, marketing, publicity, and promotional activities.</p>
<p><strong><a name="auto">5. Information We Collect Automatically</a></strong></p>
<p>Destination, and our third party service providers (including analytics providers, advertising companies and third party content providers), may automatically collect certain "Usage Information" whenever you visit or interact with the Destination Services. "Usage Information" typically includes the browser and operating system you may be using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to the Destination Services (if applicable), the search terms you entered into a search engine that lead you to the Destination Services (if applicable), all of the areas within the Destination Services that you visit, and the time of day you used the Destination Services, among other information relating to your use of the Destination Services. We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including analyzing and improving the Destination Services and products, to provide special offers, and to select appropriate content to display to you.</p>
<p>In addition, we automatically collect your IP address, mobile device identifier or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for any computer, mobile phone or tablet, or other device you may use to access the Destination Services. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned or connected to the device you use to access a Service, and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access a Service. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information. <br>
Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context.&nbsp; Like many websites and online services, Destination currently does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit<a href=" http://www.allaboutdnt.com"> </a><a target="_blank" href="http://"></a><a href=" http://www.allaboutdnt.com" target="_blank">www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>

We may share Device Identifier and Usage Information about visitors with third party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors for similar purposes. While we may use a variety of service providers to perform advertising and analytics services, some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") or the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You may want to visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> which provides information regarding targeted advertising and the "opt-out" procedures of NAI members.

The Destination Services may contain web pages or other features through which you may be able to unsubscribe or modify the e-mail messages or similar communications we send to you. You can choose to opt out of receiving marketing e-mails by following the opt-out instructions provided to you in those e-mails.

For example, the Destination Services may provide links to third party sites through which you can purchase merchandise, products or services or which link to a product or service offered by a third party. The Destination Services may also contain certain third party applications, such as email, web browser toolbars, wallpapers or other downloads or software applications.

<p>We take commercially reasonable security measures to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it, including encryption of Personal Information transmitted over the Internet.
