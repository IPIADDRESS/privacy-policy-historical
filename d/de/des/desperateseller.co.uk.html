Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using the Site.<br><br>

</p><h3>Introduction</h3>

This privacy policy (“Policy”) applies to the use of this website and any other associated website owned or operated by DesperateSeller.co.uk Ltd or any of its subsidiary companies (together being the “Site”). If you do not accept this privacy policy, you should not use this Site.<br><br>

We have updated our Policy. This Policy has been designed to provide greater transparency and has been set out so that it is easier to read and understand. We will continue to treat your personal information with care and respect.<br><br>

We collect personal information from you (such as name, address, telephone number, email address etc) when you complete registration or enquiry forms or send emails to us. Please do not submit your personal information to us if you do not wish us to collect it. Furthermore, we may record any telephone calls made to telephone numbers included on the Site. Further information on the collection and use of data is set out below.<br><br>

<br><br>

<h3>6. DesperateSeller.co.uk Ltd Use of Cookies</h3>
The law on cookies changed in May 2011. Under the revised regulations, the requirement is not just to provide clear information about the cookies but also to obtain consent from users or subscribers to store a cookie on their device. It has been designed to protect online privacy by making consumers aware of how personal information about them is collected by websites, and enabling them to choose whether or not they want it to happen. Please read on for more information.
<br><br>
6.1 What is a cookie? A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent from our web server to your browser, which is saved on the hard drive of your computer, smartphone or other device (“your device”).<br><br>
A cookie cannot:<br>
• read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites;<br>
• damage your system;<br>
• run programmes on your computer; or<br>
• deliver viruses.<br><br>

You can change your browser settings to refuse cookies or alert you when a cookie is being sent at any time. If you do choose not to accept cookies, some features of the Site may not work as intended (e.g. services accessed while logged in, customised areas of the Site). We do not use cookies to identify you personally, except when you opt to use the ‘Remember me’ facility when logging in.<br><br>

There are two broad classes of cookie: session and permanent.<br><br>

Session cookies<br>
These are used to keep track of information needed by a user and their browser on their journey through a website. Session cookies have a short lifetime and expire within a few minutes of the user leaving the site. Occasionally we will use 30 Day cookies which are similar to Session cookies but last a bit longer. They remember basic date to help improve the service you receive from us (for example, remembering vehicles that you have viewed in the last 30 days).
<br><br>
Permanent Cookies<br>
These are stored on your computer and are not deleted when the browser is closed. This is so they can retain your preferences for a particular website, allowing those preferences to be used in future browsing sessions. Permanent cookies can be used to analyse users' surfing behaviour within the Site, so that we can improve our services and allows us to prioritise our enhancements to the Site.
<br><br>
6.2 We use cookies to:<br>
• remember that you have used the Site before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive to different parts of the Site. This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get and make sure that the Site runs fast enough;<br>
• keep you logged in for the duration of your visit, which enables you to complete certain actions on the Site, for example, move from one page to another within the Site, adding cars to a shortlist, using watchlists, viewing catalogues and using Simulcast.<br>
• store your preferences or your user name and password so that you do not need to input these every time you visit the Site;<br>
• customise elements of the layout and/or content of the pages of the Site for you;<br>
• collect statistical information about how you use the Site so that we can improve the Site;<br>
• gather information about the pages on the Site that you visit, and also other information about other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a "market segment"; and<br>
• enable basic web traffic analysis using Google Analytics.<br><br>

We also use some cookies from trusted third party sources to enable us to provide you with certain features on the Site, for example our live chat facility which uses cookies to enable the chat software to work.
When you access the Site you will receive a message advising you that if you continue to use the Site, you are consenting to cookies being placed on your device in order to maximise your experience on the Site and allow us to make improvements.<br><br>

Removing some of our cookies may seriously disrupt your use of the Site. You can always come back to this Privacy Policy at any time to find out how to change your preferences. You will find a link to this policy at the bottom of all of our web pages.<br><br>

Information is collected by reference to the IP address that you are using and includes information about the county and city you are in, together with the name of your internet service provider. The information is sometimes used to place interest-based advertisements on the Site which it is believed will be relevant to your market segment. For more information about this type of interest based advertising, and about how to turn this feature off please visit www.youronlinechoices.com/uk.<br><br>

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. Visiting www.allaboutcookies.org will provide information on settings within your browser as well as other useful information on cookies. Please note however, that by blocking or deleting cookies used on the Site you may not be able to take full advantage of the Site if you do so.<br><br>

6.3 How do I disable cookies?<br>
You can change your browser settings to refuse cookies or alert you when a cookie is being sent at any time.<br><br>
Further guidance on how to control and delete cookies can be found at http://www.allaboutcookies.org. Please note that removing some of our cookies may seriously disrupt your use of the Site and some features may not work as intended.<br><br>
We do use some cookies from trusted third party sources to enable us to provide you with certain features on the Site and have included any relevant third parties on our cookie list so that you can control the cookies they place more easily.<br><br>

6.4 What about Hyperlinks? The Site may sometimes contain hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties. These third party websites have their own privacy policies, including cookies and we urge you to review them. They will govern the use of any personal information you submit or which is collected by cookies whilst visiting these websites. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such third party websites is at your own risk.
<br><br>
6.5 What about Flash Cookies? A Flash Cookie is a type of cookie which is collected via Adobe Flash Player, and is a piece of software which you probably have on your device to watch videos or podcasts online. We may use Adobe Flash Player to display video or image content. It may not be possible to block or restrict or block Flash Cookies using your browser settings, however, information on how to control flash play privacy and security settings is available from the Adobe website at: http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security
<br><br>
6.6 Who do I contact about Cookies? If you have any questions about our use of Cookies, please contact us at enquiries@desperatseller.co.uk.
<br><br>

<h3>7. Use of Your Personal Information Submitted to Other Websites</h3>
7.1 We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites even if you accessed the third party website using links from the Site or you linked to the Site from a third party website.
<br><br>
7.2 We recommend that you check the policy of each website you visit and contact the owner or operator of such website if you have any concerns or questions.
<br><br>
<h3>8. Changes to this Policy</h3>
8.1 If we need to change our Policy at some point in the future to reflect our data collection and disclosure practices we'll post the changes at least 30 days before they take effect. Our use of personal information gathered while the current policy is in effect will always be consistent with the current policy, even if we change that policy later.
