<p>
The right does not apply where the processing of your personal information is necessary:
</p>
<ul>
<li>For compliance with a legal obligation requiring DesperateSeller.co.uk Ltd to process your personal information or where the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest</li>
<li>For the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
<p>
You have the right to request that DesperateSeller.co.uk Ltd restrict the processing of your personal information in the following circumstances:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Where you have contested the accuracy of the personal information. In this case the processing of the personal information will be restricted for a period which enables DesperateSeller.co.uk Ltd to verify the accuracy of the personal information in question.</li>
<li>Where the processing of the personal information is unlawful and you have objected to the information being erased and have instead requested the restriction of its use.</li>
<li>Where DesperateSeller.co.uk Ltd no longer needs the personal information for the purposes set out above but you require them for establishing, exercising or defending legal claims.</li>
<li>Where you have objected to the processing of your personal information. In this case, processing of your personal information will be restricted pending verification of whether our legitimate grounds for continuing to process your personal information override your grounds for objecting.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Where processing of your personal information is restricted for any of the reasons above DesperateSeller.co.uk Ltd will not process it, with the exception of storage, unless:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You have provided your consent,</li>
<li>For the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims,</li>
<li>For the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person, or</li>
<li>For reasons of important public interest.</li>

<p>
Where DesperateSeller.co.uk Ltd have agreed to restrict the processing of your personal information, we will write to you to inform you that we will be lifting that restriction prior to doing so.
<br>
</p>
<h3>Right to data portability</h3>
<p>
This right only applies in the following circumstances:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the personal information in question consists of information you have provided to DesperateSeller.co.uk Ltd,</li>
<li>Where the grounds for processing the personal information stated in section 2 above are consent, explicit consent or for the performance of a contract or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and</li>
<li>The processing of the personal information is carried via automated means.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Where this right applies, you have the right to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format. You also have the right to transmit that information to another data controller or, where possible, directly from DesperateSeller.co.uk Ltd to another controller.
<br>
</p>

<li>The right to object specifically to the processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation. This only applies where the grounds for processing are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by a third party, or</li>
<li>Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest</li>
</ul>

<p>
You have the right to object specifically to the processing of your personal information for the purposes of direct marketing. If you object to the processing of your personal information in this way, then DesperateSeller.co.uk Ltd will no longer process it for that purpose.
<br>
</p>
<h3>Rights in relation to automated decision making &amp; profiling</h3>
<p>
You have the right not to be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which would legally affect you or significantly affect you. However, this right will not apply if the decision:
</p><ul>
<li>Is necessary for the entering into, or performance of, a contract between you and DesperateSeller.co.uk Ltd</li>
<li>Is authorised by or under any law to which DesperateSeller.co.uk Ltd is subject, or</li>
<li>Is based on your explicit consent.</li>
</ul>
