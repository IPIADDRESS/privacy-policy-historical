    <h2>When and how do we collect the Information?</h2>
    <p>We collect information from you for various purposes including but not limited to the following: </p>
			
    <h3>1) Member Registration:</h3>
    <p>If you choose to become a registered member of our Website, you will be required to share some of your personal details such as your name, e-mail address, a unique login name, password, and password validation. This information is collected on the registration form for several reasons including but not limited to the following: </p>
    <ul class="roman-list">
      <li>Personal Identification Purposes;</li>
      <li>Allowing You To Submit New Deals And Share Your Opinion With Others;</li>
      <li>Allowing You Access To Content/Deals Unavailable For Access To Users Not Registered On Our Website; And</li>
      <li>If Necessary, Customizing The Content Of This Website To Strive To Meet Your Specific Needs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2) Automatic Logging of Session Data</h3>
    <p>We automatically log generic information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which we call "session data", that is anonymous and not linked to any personal information. Session data consists of information such as the IP address, operating system, type of browser software being used by you and the activities conducted by you on our Website. An IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the internet, such as our web servers, know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of the site the user wishes to view. We collect session data because it helps us analyse things such as the items visitors are likely to click on most, the manner in which visitors click preferences on our Website, number of visitors surfing to various pages on the site, time spent by the visitors on our Website and frequency of their visit . It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our systems. Although such information does not identify any visitor personally, it is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP), and the approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.</p>
    <h3>3) Cookies</h3>
  	<p>The use of cookies is very common on the Internet and DesiDime’s use of cookies is similar to that prevailing in the industry from to time. No personal information about you is gathered or stored in the cookies placed by our Website and, as a result, none can be passed on to any third party.</p>
    <h3>4) Other</h3>
    <p>We may from time to time add or enhance products/services available on our Website.
