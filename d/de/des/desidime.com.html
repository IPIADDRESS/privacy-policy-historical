<h1>DesiDime Privacy Policy</h1>
Last Updated: September 25th 2010
<hr>
<div class="privacy_policy">
<p>This Privacy Statement relates solely to the online information collection and use practices of our Web site located at www.desidime.com (herin after the "Web Site") and its affiliate or individual websites hereinafter contained within. We ("Parity Labs" or owners of the Web Site) recognize that many visitors and users of this Web Site are concerned about the information they provide to us, and how we treat that information. This Privacy Statement, which may be updated from time to time, has been developed to address those concerns.</p>

<p>DesiDime.com (or the "Web Site") takes your privacy very seriously. Your use of this Website (www.desidime.com) indicates to us that you (herin after referred also as "consumers" or "users" ) have read and accept our privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy Policy. </p>

<p>For some services, we direct you to other stores through links on our site who may collect and use your personal information. In those cases the third-party service provider or store's privacy policy will govern how your information is handled. We encourage you to ask questions and to be very cautious before you disclose your personal information to others.</p>

<h2>What type of information does DesiDime.com collects from you?</h2>
<strong>Personal Information</strong>
<p>We only collect personally identifiable Information that you choose to provide. DesiDime may ask for certain personal information from you for the purpose of providing to you the content and/or services that you request. Personal information is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify the person to whom such information pertains. </p>

<p>DesiDime collects the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with DesiDime via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, user-specific information on what pages consumers access or visit, information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations. </p>

<strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>
<p>DesiDime also collects “non-personal” information from you, such as your operating system, browser type. the URL of the previous web site you visited, your ISP and your IP Address. This information (“Non-Personal Information”) cannot be easily used to personally identify you. We use Non-Personal  Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may in the future also share this information with Third Party Service Providers and Third Party Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming. </p>

<p>Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web Site utilizes standard technology called "cookies" and Web server logs to collect information about how our Web Site is used. Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web browser on the use~s hard drive. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web Site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web Site. This information is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with you as an individual.</p>

<h2>When and how do we collect the Information?</h2>

<p>We collect information from you for various purposes including but not limited to the following:
<br><br>
1) Member Registration:
</p><p>If you choose to become a registered member of this Website, you must provide your name, e-mail address, a unique login name, password, and password validation. This information is collected on the registration form for several reasons including but not limited to the following:
<br><br>
(i) personal identification purposes;<br>
(ii) allowing you to submit new deals and share your opinion with others; and <br>
(iii) if necessary, customizing the content of this Website to strive to meet your specific needs<br>
</p>
2) Automatic Logging of Session Data<br>
<p>
We automatically log generic information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which we call "session data", that is anonymous and not linked to any personal information. Session data consists of things such as IP address, operating system and type of browser software being used and the activities conducted by the user while on our Website. An IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the internet, such as our web servers, know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of the site the user wishes to view. We collect session data because it helps us analyze such things as what items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the site, how many visitors are surfing to various pages on the site, how long visitors to the site are staying and how often they are visiting. It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our systems. Although such information does not identify any visitor personally, it is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP), and the approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.</p>
<br>
3) Cookies

<p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are only read by the server that placed them, and are unable to do such things as run programs on your computer, plant viruses or harvest your personal information. The use of cookies is very common on the Internet and the DesiDime use of cookies is similar to that of Yahoo!, CNN.com and other reputable companies. No personal information about you is gathered or stored in the cookies placed by the DesiDime web site and, as a result, none can be passed on to any third parties.</p>

<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. By changing the options on your web browser or using certain software programs, you can control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your browser. DesiDime understands and supports your right to block any unwanted Internet activity, especially that of unscrupulous websites. However, blocking DesiDime cookies may disable certain features on our site and may make it impossible to use certain services available on the site.</p>
<br>
4) Other
<p>
From time to time we may add or enhance services available on the site. To the extent these services are provided and used by you, we will use the information you provide to facilitate the service requested. For example, if you email us with a question, we will use your email address, name, nature of the question, etc. to respond to your question. We may also store such information to assist us in making the site the better and easier to use.</p>
<p></p>
