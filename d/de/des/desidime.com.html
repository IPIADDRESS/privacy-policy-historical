This information is collected on the registration form for several reasons including but not limited to the following:</p>
    <ul class="roman-list">
      <li>Personal Identification Purposes;</li>

    <h2>2) Automatic Logging of Session Data</h2>
    <p>We automatically log generic information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which we call "session data", that is anonymous and not linked to any personal information. Session data consists of information such as the IP address, operating system, type of browser software being used by you and the activities conducted by you on our Website and/or our mobile application. An IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the internet, such as our web servers, know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of the site the user wishes to view. We collect session data because it helps us analyse things such as the items visitors are likely to click on most, the manner in which visitors click preferences on our Website and/or our mobile application, number of visitors surfing to various pages on the site, time spent by the visitors on our Website and/or our mobile application and frequency of their visit . It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our systems.

    <h2>3) Cookies</h2>
