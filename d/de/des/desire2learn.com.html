    <h1>Desire2Learn<sup>†</sup> Privacy Statement</h1>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>We at the Desire2Learn family of companies ("we" or "us") are committed to protecting the privacy of our users.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Statement applies to personal information collected (1) at Desire2Learn Web sites and other sites that we own or control that link to this policy ("Desire2Learn Web sites"), (2) for or by Desire2Learn enterprise offerings that are hosted by Desire2Learn or its service providers, and (3) for or by Desire2Learn consumer offerings. There are two main classes of users of Desire2Learn offerings: enterprise users and consumer users. Enterprise users access offerings by virtue of an agreement that we have with the user's employer, institution (educational or otherwise) or other organization ("Organization"). Consumer users access Desire2Learn offerings by virtue of an agreement directly with us.</p>
            <p>If you are an enterprise user, this statement does not affect the terms of any agreement between you and your Organization. You should read and understand the terms of any privacy statements or policies that you enter into with parties other than us, including your Organization, as those policies may also explain how your personal information is used by those parties.</p>
            <p>Please review this Privacy Statement to understand how the information you provide to us will be treated.</p>

      		<p>Personal information is information that can be used to personally identify you or is associated with any such information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, and so forth. This Privacy Statement does not apply to information we collect in the aggregate. Aggregated information does not identify you as an individual.</p>
            <p>We may collect personal information from you in the following ways:</p>
            <h3>Registration</h3>
            <p>In order to access some Desire2Learn offerings, you will be asked to create an account (such as an EduDentity™ account) which will require you to provide us with information that may include your name and email address and other personally identifiable information.</p>
            <h3>Information You Choose to Provide</h3>
            <p>Certain Desire2Learn offerings enable you to provide information about yourself or others. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is up to you, but providing additional information may enable you to derive more benefit from Desire2Learn offerings.</p>
          <h3>Customer Service and Support</h3>
          <p>We may collect information about you if your Organization has contracted with us for end-user support and you use that support, or if you are an approved support contact ("ASC") under our agreement with your Organization and you contact our help desk. This information may include your name, email address or other personally identifiable information.</p>
          <p>We may collect information about you if you contact us for email or other support for a Desire2Learn consumer offering.</p>
          <h3>Web Sites, eCommerce and Other Marketing Initiatives</h3>
          <p>At some Desire2Learn Web sites, we ask you to provide information, such as your email address, name, employer name, home or work address, or telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such as your postal or zip code, gender, age, preferences, interests and favorites.</p>
          <p>We may collect personal information from you such as your name, email address, telephone number and Organization information when you sign up for webinars, product trials, newsletters, our annual FUSION users' conference, contests or other marketing initiatives through the Desire2Learn Web sites.</p>
          <p>If you choose to make a purchase (including through the Desire2Learn Online Store) or sign up for a conference or seminar, a paid subscription service or a consumer offering, we may ask for additional information, such as your credit card information, billing address, shipping address.</p>
          <p>When you join the Desire2Learn Community and the Desire2Learn Partner Community , we collect information such as your name, Organization and email address. You can also populate your community profiles with information beyond that provided during registration such as photos or other personally identifiable information.</p>
          <p>When you post information to one of our communities, you share your profile information, including your name and other information that you choose to share, with other community members.</p>
          <p>When you post a comment on our Learning Insights blog you may share information within your comment, along with the name you provide with the general public.</p>
          <h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
          <p>Like most Web sites, we use technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take in using Desire2Learn offerings and Desire2Learn Web sites.</p>
          <h3>Information Collected by Third Parties</h3>
          <p>If you are an enterprise user, your Organization may collect information on its own through the use of Desire2Learn offerings. Collection and use of information in this way is governed by the privacy policies of your Organization and is beyond our control.</p>

        <p>In addition to providing you the services or products that you have requested, we collect and use your information to operate and improve Desire2Learn offerings and Desire2Learn Web sites. These uses include providing you with more effective customer service; making offerings easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving Desire2Learn offerings and technologies and Desire2Learn Web sites; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.</p>
