	<p>Last updated: June 30, 2008</p>

      Your privacy is very important to us.  We have drafted and implemented this Privacy Policy in furtherance of our commitment to keeping you informed about what we do with the
      information we collect and what steps we take to safeguard your privacy and protect your personal information.  In order to ensure that this Privacy Policy is up-to-date and
      responsive to changes in our website(s), our business activities, relevant laws and regulations and developments in the applicable technology we reserve the right to change
      and/or amend this Privacy Policy from time to time.  Your use of our website(s) constitutes your consent to the current version of our Privacy Policy.

    <p>
      We have organized this Privacy Policy as a series of answers to questions that we have found to be of most interest to consumers.  If you do not see the answer to any question

    <h3>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h3>
    <p>
      Adchemy, Inc. owns and operates several websites, including (but not limited to) ratemarketplace.com and degrees.info, as well as a number of websites and/or domains that
      point to one or another of our websites.  Additionally, we intend to add additional sites to our portfolio.  Whether or not any particular site is specifically identified
      in this Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy applies to any Adchemy-owned and/or operated website.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy covers what we do with any personal information you may submit or authorize us to obtain, as well as any other information that we may gather when you
      access any of our websites.  This Privacy Policy also covers any or your personal and other information that any of our business partners may share with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that our policies and procedures apply only to websites maintained by us and not to websites maintained by other companies or to any website to which we may
      link or to unrelated businesses with which we may share information.
    </p>
    <h3>What is "Personal Information"?</h3>
	<p>
      Personal information is any information that you provide to us or authorize us to obtain that identifies you, personally, or that can be logically associated with you.
      Examples of personal information would be your name, your address, your e-mail address and your Social Security Number.  Demographic information such as gender, age, zip code, etc.
      is generally not considered personal information.
    </p>
    <h3>Why Do You Need To Collect Personal Information?</h3>
    <p>
      We collect and use personal information in order to respond more completely to your requests for products and services offered through our websites and those of our business partners.
      We also collect personal and other information in order to make you aware of products and/or services that are likely to be of interest to you.
    </p>
    <h3>What Information Do You Collect and/or Maintain?</h3>
    <p>We collect and maintain the information you provide to us whenever you visit our website(s), such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Any information you provide to us when you request a product or service.  This information is likely to include your name, your address, your telephone number and in some cases
        your Social Security Number.  Depending upon the product or service you request, you may also be asked to provide additional information such as the amount of an existing mortgage
        or other home-related debt or your estimated credit score.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any information you provide to us or to one of our business partners when you request a quote or a product or service offered by one of our business partners.
      </li>
      <li>
        Information, such as your e-mail address, that you provide to us when you register to receive communications from us or when you communicate with us through our
        customer service facility, or otherwise correspond with us.
      </li>
      <li>
       Information you provide when you apply for a job with Adchemy.  Please note that any information you provide in connection with a job application is used only to evaluate
       you and your qualifications for a particular position with Adchemy.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We also collect other, non-personal information, which is broadly defined as any information that is not associated directly with you or your personal information.
      An example of other, non-personal information, such as demographic information, would be your zip code.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the information we collect from you, we may also receive information about you from other on-line or off-line sources.  For example, if you provide us with
      personal information along with an appropriate authorization we may request and obtain a credit report and credit score to enable us to better match you with a provider
      offering the product or service you desire.
    </p>
    <h3>How Do You Use The Personal and Other Information You Collect?</h3>
	<p>
	  We use the personal information you supply to us, or that you authorize us to obtain, to provide to you the service(s) or product(s) that you request at the time you
	  provide us with that information.  In addition, we use your personal and other information to enhance your experience on our website(s) by displaying content based on your
	  preferences and/or to send information to you about additional products or services in which you may be interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      We "depersonalize" your personal information to enable us to use that information, aggregated with the information of others, for research, analysis and modeling purposes.
    </p>
    <h3>With Whom Do You Share My Information?</h3>
    <p>
      If you submit a request for a product or service, we will share the personal and other information you supply (such as your name, address, Social Security Number, etc.)
      with those product and service providers that have agreed to participate in our network.  By submitting your request you are consenting to being contacted by us or by our business
      partners, through any means, based on the information you provide to us, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the Federal Trade Commission,
      any state Do Not Call List or the Do Not Call List of any specific institution.  If, after you are contacted by any product or service provider, you do not wish to be
      contacted by that person again you must make a specific request to that person.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also share your personal and other information with a third-party that provides a service or supplies a specific functionality to us, such as a call center operator.
      These service providers will be provided only with the information necessary for them to perform their functions and are not allowed to share any of the provided information with
      others for any purpose whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that any person with whom we share your personal information is separately required to comply with federal and state privacy regulations and requirements
      and will have its own privacy policies that should be made available to you at the time you are first contacted.
    </p>
    <h3>Are There Any Other Circumstances Where You Disclose My Information?</h3>
    <p>
      We may be required to share your information with law enforcement or government agencies in response to subpoenas, court orders or other forms of legal process.
      We may elect to share information when, in our reasonable judgment, such sharing is necessary or appropriate for the investigation or prevention of illegal activities,
      including actual or suspected fraud, real or potential threats to the physical safety of any person or otherwise as required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, if Adchemy is merged with, or acquired by, another company the successor company will have access to all of the information collected and maintained by Adchemy.
      In such a circumstance, the successor company would continue to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <h3>How Do You Use Technology To Collect Information?</h3>
    <p>
      We collect and store certain types of non-personal information and technical data from each visitor to our website(s).  For example, when you click on a banner advertisement
      or text link that is associated with one of our websites, the banner or text placement, along with the time of your visit, your Internet Protocol address and other
      path-related information, is sent to us.  Similarly, the page requests you make when you visit our website(s) are stored and used by us.  We use this information, none of
      which is or can be personally associated with you, for statistical and analytic purposes, to help us understand which page views are most appealing to our customers and to
      help us improve the likelihood that we will be able to offer you only products or services in which you have a genuine interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What Are Cookies?</strong>  "Cookies" are bits of code that are placed automatically on your hard drive when you visit a website.
      Cookies enable a website to recognize you as a return visitor and, by keeping track of your website activity, help personalize and enrich your experience
      by helping us identify which pages to serve while reducing the time it takes for pages to load.  Cookies are not tied to your personal information.  If you do
      not wish to accept cookies or if you wish to remove cookies that remain in your browser following the close of your browser session, you may adjust the settings on
      your web browser to prevent cookies from being placed on your hard drive.  Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Do You Use Any Other Advertising Technology?</strong>  We use third-party advertising technology to serve ads on our website(s) and on the websites where we advertise.
      Generally, advertisements are served by ad networks, such as DoubleClick, that are independent of us.  Third-party servers may employ cookies or action tags to measure
      advertising effectiveness, target advertising to individuals and for other purposes.  For more information about third party technology used to serve advertising, as well as
      to obtain software tools that will allow you to opt-out of targeted advertising, please visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What Are Web Beacons?</strong>  "Web beacons" are, like cookies, bits of code that enable our ad server to recognize a visitor's cookie when the visitor returns to our site.
      Web beacons may also be used in e-mail advertising to help us track which e-mail messages have been opened.  Web beacons are used to track the movement of visitors to our sites and,
      like cookies, are not tied to your personally identifiable information.
    </p>
    <h3>How Do You Safeguard The Information You Collect?</h3>
    <p>The security of your personal information is a very high priority for us and we take a number of steps to safeguard it.  Some of the measures we take are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Limiting access to personal information to those employees who are critical to the delivery of products and services to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implementing appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to guard against unauthorized access or use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Requiring appropriate consents and protections from our business partners before we share any personally identifiable information.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Adchemy uses commercially reasonable physical and technical security measures to protect all personal information in our possession.
      Sensitive information such as social security or driver�s license numbers are encrypted using secure sockets layer encryption from the time of your submission and
      while it is stored by us.  We cannot, however, guarantee or warrant the absolute security of any system or that any information we hold will not be accessed,
      disclosed, altered or destroyed.
    </p>
    <h3>How Long Do You Retain My Personal Information?</h3>
    <p>
      We normally retain your personal information for at least one (1) year from the date we first collect it, although sometimes we may be required to retain it for a longer period.
      Non-personal information is generally retained indefinitely.  If we obtain your Social Security Number we will only store it for a limited period of time, currently not more than
      14 calendar days after you submit it to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that, under certain circumstances, Federal and/or state law may require us to retain your personal information for different periods of time.
      Accordingly, we may not be able to delete or otherwise remove your personal information from our systems.
    </p>
    <h3>Can I Correct or Remove My Personal Information?</h3>
    <p>
      If you believe there are factual errors in any of the information you have submitted through an Adchemy website, please contact us and advise us of the error.
      To protect your privacy and security we may require that you verify your identity to our satisfaction before we permit access or changes to any personal information.
    </p>
    <h3>What Choices Do I Have?</h3>
    <p>
      You can always elect not to provide personal information to us, although if you do not complete and submit the information we ask for we may not be able to provide
      you with the most complete responses or you may not be able to access all the available features.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you decide, at a later point in time, that you no longer want us to share your personal information with our business partners you may notify us either by sending us
      an e-mail us at optout@adchemy.com or by writing to us at the following address:
