    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div>
      <p><strong>DegreeSearch.org.org Web Privacy Statement</strong><br>
        <em>This privacy policy was last updated on July 1, 2006</em> <br>
DegreeSearch.org is committed to protecting your privacy  when you visit our Websites, so we want you to know what information we collect  when you visit one of our sites, how we use that information, and how you can  update it. We reserve the right to append or otherwise modify this Privacy  Statement at any time, so please re-visit this page occasionally to check for  updates. </p>
      <p><strong>Information We Collect</strong><br>
        We collect various types of information from our visitors so we can adjust our  site to meet our users' needs and expectations. Some of this information is  collected automatically through cookies and other information is collected when  you register for any of our online services or when you request information  from one of our partners. </p>
      <p><strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong><br>
        The types of information your browser or Internet session automatically sends  us each time you visit one of our sites, which we automatically collect, includes: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Your browser, e.g., Internet       Explorer, Netscape Navigator. </li>
        <li>Your Internet domain, e.g.,       AOL, Netcom, Earthlink, etc. </li>
        <li>You computer's operating       system, e.g., Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, Linux. </li>
        <li>Your navigation path, i.e.,       the URLs of where you come to our site from, which of our pages you visit,       and where you go as you leave. </li>
        <li>Your IP address. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This information lets us see how users are finding our  sites, and it tells us which pages are visited the most often so we can make  our Websites more useful. </p>
      <p><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong><br>
        In addition to the information automatically collected by your browser, we also  collect information that you provide to us when you request information about a  particular school or educational program.</p>
      <p>Our websites provide users the opportunity to request  information from schools, and to learn about various education opportunities.  These information request sites require users to provide us with contact  information (name, address, phone number, email address, age, work experience,  etc.) as well as information about their interest in one of our educational  partners (universities, colleges, test prep companies, financial aid providers,  etc.). &nbsp;We collect this information that  you provide, and may use it to make your future requests from our websites  easier by pre-populating contact forms with the information that you have  provided. We provide this contact information that you provide to the  educational partner that you requested information from. Customer interest  information is collected to determine what information the customer wishes to  be sent. </p>
      <p><strong>How We Use This Information</strong><br>
        We use the information we automatically collect to help us better plan our sites  to meet your Internet needs. Information you provide to us is used for marketing  purposes, and may result in follow-up communications. </p>
      <p><strong>Your Rights Our Obligations</strong> <br>
        The company respects the privacy of users visiting our sites and will abide by  all applicable laws concerning the release of personal information. On an  occasion we may use certain directory information that we have collected to  send you information about products and services, or updates and other  information we think may be of interest to you. We may share this information  with our educational partners to bring similar information to your attention.  If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis  for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. Please contact us to  request your name and address be removed from our lists. If you do not want to  receive our e-mail marketing, please submit a request to have your e-mail  address removed by emailing: unsubscribe@DegreeSearch.org. <br>
        Other than directory information, data you provide to us as  you use the Website will be held in strict confidence by the company and will  be used for company purposes only. </p>
      <p><strong>Our Security Measures</strong><br>
        Our Websites have security measures in place to protect against the loss,  misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. </p>
      <p><strong>Why We Use "Cookies"</strong> <br>
        When you visit some of our sites, we use cookies to keep track of your  information. This small piece of program code resides on your computer and  stores your contact information for all of our request information sites. We do  this so you are not required to re-enter your contact information. </p>
      <p><strong>Links From Our Site To Other Sites</strong> <br>
        Some of our sites  may contain links to other sites external to our sites. DegreeSearch.org is not  responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any Websites which we  do not directly control. </p>
      <p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
        Data created by a Web server that is stored on a user's computer. It provides a  way for the Website to keep track of a user's patterns and preferences and,  with the cooperation of the Web browser, to store them on the user's own hard  disk. <br>
        The cookies contain a range of URLs (Web addresses) for  which they are valid. When the browser encounters those URLs again, it sends  those specific cookies to the Web server. For example, if a user's ID were  stored as a cookie, it would save that person from typing in the same  information all over again when accessing that service for the second and  subsequent time during the same browser session.</p>
      <p> You can opt out of the use of cookies by having your browser  disable cookies or warn you before accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie  options in your browser in the Options or Preferences menu.</p>
      <p>        <strong>IP (Internet Protocol) Address</strong><br>
        This is the address of a computer attached to a TCP/IP network. Every client  and server station must have a unique IP address. Client workstations have  either a permanent address or one that is dynamically assigned for each  session. IP addresses are written as four sets of numbers separated by periods;  for example, 204.171.64.2. </p>
      <p><strong>Browser Session</strong><br>
        A browser session is defined as the period of time a browser is in consecutive  use. The session begins when you open the browser and ends when you close it.  When you reopen the browser, you begin a new session. </p>
      <p><strong>SSL Encryption (Secure Sockets Layer)</strong><br>
        The leading security protocol on the Internet. When an SSL session is started,  the browser sends its public key to the server so that the server can securely  send a secret key to the browser. The browser and server exchange data via  secret key encryption during that session. </p>
      <p><strong>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</strong><br>
        An Internet address. URLs are used to locate sites on the Internet and to  navigate between sites and pages within sites. The URL for DegreeSearch.org is  www.DegreeSearch.org. </p>
