<h2>Information We Collect Automatically</h2>
<p>We collect various types of information from our visitors so we can adjust our site to meet our users’ needs and expectations. Some of this information is collected automatically through cookies and other information is collected when you register for any of our online services or when you request information from one of our partners.</p>

<p> The types of information your browser or Internet session automatically sends us each time you visit one of our sites, which we automatically collect and does not identify individual users, includes: </p>
<ul>
 <li>Your browser, e.g., Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator.</li>
 <li>Your Internet domain, e.g., AOL, Netcom, Earthlink, etc.</li>
 <li>Your computer's operating system, e.g., Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, Linux.</li>
 <li>Your navigation path, i.e., the URLs of where you come to our site from, which of our pages you visit, and where you go as you leave.</li>
 <li>Your IP address. This information lets us see how users are finding our sites, and it tells us which pages are visited the most often so we can make our Websites more useful.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
<p> When you visit some of our sites, we use cookies to keep track of your information. This small piece of program code resides on your computer and stores your contact information for all of our request information sites. We do this so you are not required to re-enter your contact information. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personal information you submit while on our site. You can remove these cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site may be limited.</p>

<p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by DegreeSearch.org only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<p>We use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the internet. Along with vendors like Google, we use cookies to inform, optimize and serve ads based on a userâ€™s past visits to our website. We also use cookies to report how ad impressions and ad interactions relate to visits to our site. We use data from Googleâ€™s Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) with Google Analytics.</p>

<h2>Web Beacons </h2>
<p>Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information.   </p>

<h2>Information You Provide to Us</h2>
<p>In addition to the information automatically collected by your browser, we also collect information that you provide to us when you request information about a particular school or educational program.</p>
<p>Our websites provide users the opportunity to request information from schools, and to learn about various education opportunities. These information request sites require users to provide us with contact information (name, address, phone number, email address, age, work experience, etc.) as well as information about their interest in one of our marketing partners (universities, colleges, test prep companies, financial aid providers, etc.). We collect this information that you provide, and may use it to make your future requests from our websites easier by pre-populating contact forms with the information that you have provided. We provide the contact information that you provide us to the marketing partner about which you requested information. Customer interest information is collected to determine what information the customer wishes to be sent.</p>

<h2>How We Use This Information</h2>
<p>We use the information we automatically collect to help us better plan our sites to meet your Internet needs. Information you provide to us is used for marketing purposes, and may result in follow-up communications.</p>

<h3>Business Transactions:</h3>
<p>In the event DegreeSearch.org goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via email prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users’ personal information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.</p>
