          <p>In addition to the information automatically collected by your browser, we also collect information that you provide to us when you request information about a particular school or educational program.</p>		
          <p>Our websites provide users the opportunity to request information from schools, and to learn about various education opportunities.

          <h2>Why We Use "Cookies"</h2>

          <p>When you visit some of our sites, we use cookies to keep track of your information. This small piece of program code resides on your computer and stores your contact information for all of our request information sites. We do this so you are not required to re-enter your contact information.</p>

          <h2>Links From Our Site To Other Sites</h2>
          <p>Some of our sites may contain links to other sites external to our sites. DegreeSearch.org is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any Websites which we do not directly control.</p>

          <h2>Definitions</h2>

          <dl>
            <dt>Cookies</dt>

            <dd>Data created by a Web server that is stored on a user's computer. It provides a way for the Website to keep track of a user's patterns and preferences and, with the cooperation of the Web browser, to store them on the user's own hard disk.
              <br>
              The cookies contain a range of URLs (Web addresses) for which they are valid. When the browser encounters those URLs again, it sends those specific cookies to the Web server. For example, if a user's ID were stored as a cookie, it would save that person from typing in the same information all over again when accessing that service for the second and subsequent time during the same browser session.
              <br>
              <br>
              You can opt out of the use of cookies by having your browser disable cookies or warn you before accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie options in your browser in the Options or Preferences menu.
            </dd>

            <dt>IP (Internet Protocol) Address</dt>
            <dd>This is the address of a computer attached to a TCP/IP network. Every client and server station must have a unique IP address. Client workstations have either a permanent address or one that is dynamically assigned for each session. IP addresses are written as four sets of numbers separated by periods; for example, 204.171.64.2.</dd>


            <dt>Browser Session</dt>
            <dd>A browser session is defined as the period of time a browser is in consecutive use. The session begins when you open the browser and ends when you close it. When you reopen the browser, you begin a new session.</dd>

            <dt>SSL Encryption (Secure Sockets Layer)</dt>
            <dd>The leading security protocol on the Internet. When an SSL session is started, the browser sends its public key to the server so that the server can securely send a secret key to the browser. The browser and server exchange data via secret key encryption during that session.</dd>

            <dt>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</dt>
            <dd>An Internet address. URLs are used to locate sites on the Internet and to navigate between sites and pages within sites. The URL for DegreeSearch.org is www.DegreeSearch.org.</dd>
