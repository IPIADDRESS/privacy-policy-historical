    <h1 class="gamma guts-m-b-1 font-semibold">Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: August 2015</p>
    <p>Degreed, Inc. ("Degreed") is committed to respecting the privacy of its users. We strive to provide a safe, secure online experience. This Privacy Policy sets forth the online data collection, usage, maintenance, disclosure and protection policies and practices that apply when personal information is disclosed in connection with the Degreed.com website ("Site"). We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other websites to which you choose to link from this Site. You, the User, participate in Degreed voluntarily.</p>
    <h2 class="delta guts-m-v-1 font-semibold">Consent and Revisions to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>By using this Site, you consent to this Privacy Policy. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time as we add new features or as laws change that may affect our services. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post a new version number at the beginning of this Privacy Policy, consisting of the date (year and month) the Privacy Policy was last revised, so that you will be able to tell when the Privacy Policy was last changed. By continuing to use this Site after those changes become effective, you consent and agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
    <h2 class="delta guts-m-v-1 font-semibold">What Information is Collected</h2>
    <p>Information collected may include, among other things, personal information such as a participating User's name and includes other identifying information about that person such as an email address, details of academic history and other information entered into the User profile ("Degreed Profile"). All information entered is voluntary. Examples of areas on Degreed where we collect data are pages where Users can open a Degreed account, create a Degreed Profile or enter information required for scholarship consideration. If a User does provide such information, he or she is thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy. The User maintains full rights and ownership of his or her individual personal data and to the extent the User wishes to retain an independent record of such User's Degreed Profile, the User must include a personal email at the time of creating his/her Degreed Profile.</p>
    <h2 class="delta guts-m-v-1 font-semibold">How Information is Collected</h2>
    <p>All User Materials are gathered directly from Users through online registration forms. Only the User can modify his or her own, personal Degreed Profile once it has been created.  You may remove your Degreed Profile from our database at any time.</p>
    <p>Personal User Information May Be Utilized For the Following Purposes:</p>
    <ul class="bullets guts-m-b-2">
        <li>To provide information or services that a User has requested; To service a User's account;</li>
        <li>To improve Degreed's services;</li>
        <li>To develop and/or inform Users of additional products or services we think will be of interest and benefit to Users, including allowing Users to share their information with specific universities that the Users are interested in receiving addition information about;</li>
        <li>To answer questions Users may have; and</li>
        <li>To inform winners of scholarships which we run regularly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="delta guts-m-v-1 font-semibold">Scholarships and Scholarship Selection Process</h2>
    <p>Degreed is a scholarship provider for Users seeking higher education. The scholarship selection process takes into consideration academic achievement. The selection committee uses the applicant's User Profile, which provides a comprehensive format for Users to indicate and assess academic merit. All further activity on the Degreed Site is optional. Users may use the Degreed service simply to apply for Degreed scholarships or to seek out further education opportunities, all free-of-charge. The scholarship selection panel consists of members in the education technology and instructional design fields.</p>
    <h2 class="delta guts-m-v-1 font-semibold">Non-Personally Identifiable Anonymous Information</h2>
    <p>Where possible, the Degreed servers automatically recognize each User's Internet Protocol address.  Also, aggregate information about Degreed Users is routinely gathered for purposes of identifying the use of Degreed.com, including information such as what pages are being visited most, what domains our visitors are coming from (i.e. google.com), when our servers are busiest, and what websites are referring Users to us and aggregated data for purposes of analysis, gathering employment statistical information and for learning and training. This information helps us to improve our services and to evaluate our marketing efforts. We only use such data anonymously and aggregately. This information may be shared with third parties, but only in the aggregate.  The treatment of non-personally identifiable information is subject to change in accordance with the then applicable law.  Degreed owns all rights in and to this anonymous and aggregated data.</p>
    <h2 class="delta guts-m-v-1 font-semibold">Use of Information Obtained by Degreed</h2>

Each User is able to edit and update the information provided in his or her Degreed Profile. We may, on occasion, email our Users to send notifications about new features on the site. Each User shall be allowed opt-in to such emails.</p>
    <p>Degreed will not use User personal Degreed Profile information except as described above, or as otherwise provided by law. We disclose information if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property of our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.</p>
    <h2 class="delta guts-m-v-1 font-semibold">Correction of Information/Accessibility of Information</h2>
    <p>We provide Users with 24 hour access to their Degreed Profile after input by the applicable User. Users may also wish to amend or correct inaccuracies on information provided in the Degreed Profile. If a User wishes to correct such inaccuracies or make any other changes, that User's Degreed Profile can be accessed through our password protected access facility at <a href="https://degreed.com/">https://degreed.com</a>.

From each Degreed account, Users may also opt out of receiving newsletters and certain other correspondence from Degreed. If a User wishes to delete his or her Degreed Profile, that User can do so in the Personal section of their Profile Settings. Once the User has arrived to the Profile Settings page the User can select "Delete Profile" and select "yes" to confirm that the User would like to delete his or her account. If the User is connected to an enterprise account, the User cannot delete his or her individual account.</p>
    <h2 class="delta guts-m-v-1 font-semibold">Children Under 13 Years of Age</h2>
    <p>Degreed does not intend to collect information from children under the age of 13 or knowingly allow those individuals to create profiles. All Degreed Profiles stored are for Users ages 13 or older and those seeking higher education who state their age to be 13 years or older.</p>

    Cookies on other websites
</h2>
<p>
    Users may be directed to other websites through links within Degreed. Degreed has no control over the practices of other websites not owned or controlled by Degreed. Your computer may receive cookies from other websites and such websites are not subject to Degreed's Privacy Policy. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a User's prior visits to Degreed.com.

    Other sites may place a cookie on your computer for the purposes of ad tracking and presentation. Degreed is in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act, and we are exempt from the requirements of California's "Shine the Light" law because Degreed does not share personally identifiable visitor information with its advertising services for direct marketing purposes.

    We do not control third-parties' collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit the <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/" class="underline color-degreed_blue" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a>, a coalition of online advertising networks that provides an opportunity for consumers to opt-out of targeted advertising by member companies.
