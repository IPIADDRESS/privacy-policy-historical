        <p>Last Updated: February 2019</p>
        <p>Version number: 4.0</p>
        <p>Degreed, Inc. ("Degreed") is committed to respecting the privacy of its users. We strive to provide a safe, secure online experience. This Privacy Policy sets forth the online data collection, usage, maintenance, disclosure and protection policies and practices that apply when personal information is disclosed in connection with the Degreed.com website and applications (together: "Site") and the services provided through it, such as our Degreed learning platform ("Services"). We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other websites to which links are included on this Site. </p>
        <h3 class="guts-m-v-1 font-semibold m-lh-1-half">Consent and Revisions to this Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time as we add new features or as laws change that may affect our Site or Services. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will let you know in an appropriate manner and we will post a new version number at the beginning of this Privacy Policy, consisting of the date (year and month) the Privacy Policy was last revised, so that you will be able to tell when the Privacy Policy was last changed.</p>
        <h3 class="guts-m-v-1 font-semibold m-lh-1-half">What Information is Collected</h3>
        <p>We collect and process personal information about you when you interact with us and our Services. Such information may include:</p>
        <ul class="bullets color-shuttle guts-m-b-2">
            <li>Your name, email address, username and password;</li>
            <li>Your academic history and other information you entered into your User profile ("Degreed Profile"), and how you use our Services;</li>
            <li>Your marketing preferences, including any consents you have given us; and</li>
            <li>Information related to the browser or device you use to access our Site, as also further detailed in our <a href="/cookies" class="color-degreed_blue underline" data-dgat="Privacy-39c">Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most personal information you provide to us is voluntary, unless indicated otherwise. Examples of areas on the Site where we collect data are pages where you can open a Degreed account and create a Degreed Profile. Only you can modify your own personal Degreed Profile once it has been created. You may remove your Degreed Profile from our database at any time. To the extent you wish to retain an independent record of such your Degreed Profile, you must include a personal email address at the time of creating your Degreed Profile.</p>
        <p>We may combine the information we collect with publicly available information and information we receive from our parent, affiliate, or subsidiary companies, business partners, and other third parties. We may use that combined information to enhance and personalize your experience with us, to communicate with you about products, services, and events that may be of interest to you, for promotional purposes, and for other purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>In addition, if you access and use the Site or the Services on a mobile device and your mobile device's settings allow it, we may collect information about your real-time location. If you access our Services using a mobile device, you may adjust the settings on your mobile device to allow or prevent the sharing of location information. For example, you can disable "Location" (or "Location Services" on iOS-based devices) on your mobile device to prevent sharing your location information with us. Please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your mobile device to learn how to adjust your mobile device settings. Please note that if you disable the sharing of location information, you may be unable to access some features of our Services that are designed for mobile devices.</p>
        <p>We may enable you to log into the Services using a social media account, and if you do so you may be asked to grant us access to certain information from your social media profile, such as your public profile, birthday, current city, and e-mail address. Social media networks operate independently from Degreed, and we are not responsible for social media networks' interfaces or privacy or security practices. Please refer to the privacy settings of the applicable social media platform or application to determine how you may manage the interactivity between us and your social media account.</p>
