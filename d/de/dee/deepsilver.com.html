<h5 id="References:PrivacyPolicyDeepSilver-+AnalyticMetricsToolandOtherTechnologies">+Analytic Metrics Tool and Other Technologies</h5>
<p>Deep Silver may use its own proprietary analytic metrics tool and other analytics technologies to collect non-personal information when you use our online products and services and/or play our games on your PC, console and/or mobile device.</p>
<p>Deep Silver may also use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”) and/or Google AdSense, a web services provided by Google, through which third party advertisements are posted on the website. These tools use “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States and/or certain other countries. In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA or certain other countries. On behalf of the website provider Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website provider.

<h5 id="References:PrivacyPolicyDeepSilver-+Facebookplugins">+Facebook plugins</h5>
<p>Deep Silver uses social plugins, e.g. the “like” button, from the social networking site&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://facebook.com/" rel="nofollow">facebook.com</a>. These plugins are operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). The plugins can be identified from one of the Facebook logos.</p>
<p>If a user accesses one of our websites that contains one of these plugins, its internet browser connects directly with the Facebook servers. Facebook sends the content of the plugins directly to the user’s browser and back. Since we have absolutely no control over the amount of data that Facebook collects with the help of these plugins, we would like to share our latest knowledge with the user:</p>
<p>The plugins that are incorporated mean that Facebook receives notification that the user has called up the appropriate page on our website. If the user is logged in on Facebook at the same time, Facebook can allocate the visit to the user’s personal Facebook account. If the user interacts with the plugins, such as by pressing the “like”; button or posting a comment, that information is immediately transmitted by the browser directly to Facebook, where it is saved. If the user is not using Facebook, the service can still collect and store the IP address. More information on how much data is collected and why, and how it is then processed and used by Facebook, as well as details about the users’ rights and the settings available for protecting users’ privacy, can be obtained from Facebook’s data protection policy at&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://www.facebook.com/policy.php" rel="nofollow">www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>.</p>
<p>If a user has signed up to Facebook but does not want Facebook to collect data via Deep Silver‘s website and link it up with the data stored on Facebook, it must log off Facebook before visiting Deep Silver.</p>
<p>If a user does not belong to Facebook or has not (yet) consented there to having its data collected and used, do not click on Facebook plugins.</p>
<h5 id="References:PrivacyPolicyDeepSilver-+FacebookPixel.1">+Facebook Pixel</h5>
<p>Our website uses also the so-called Facebook Pixel of Facebook. The Facebook Pixel is a part of code which is implemented in our website. Its aim is to show conversions (i.e. it shows which devices have been used by an user to do an action), to create so-called lookalike audiences (i.e. to reach users with ads which have similar traits like other customers) and to generate comprehensive statistics about the use of our website. If you visit our website the Facebook Pixel directly creates a connection to the servers of Facebook. In this case the Facebook server is informed that you have visited our website and Facebook allocates that information to your personal Facebook profile. Further information about the collection and use of your personal data via Facebook as well as about your rights and possibilities can be found here:&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>.

<h5 id="References:PrivacyPolicyDeepSilver-+TwitterConversionTracking">+Twitter Conversion Tracking</h5>
<p>We use the Conversion Tracking service of Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA (“Twitter”). This tracking records if a user of our website clicks on a link posted by Twitter. In this way, both we and Twitter can see if a registration has taken place. The identity of the user remains anonymous. In addition, we use Twitter’s Tailored Audiences service. This enables us to appeal to our website’s users with targeted advertisements. To do this, Twitter uses a code snippet (tag) which we have integrated into our website. No personal data are collected during this process. Tailored Audiences is also used to create lookalike targeting lists.</p>
<p>You can find more information about Twitter’s privacy policy in their data privacy statement (<a class="external-link" href="https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en</a>). You can adjust your privacy settings for tailored advertisements at this link:&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170405-your-privacy-controls-for-tailored-ads" rel="nofollow">https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170405-your-privacy-controls-for-tailored-ads</a>&nbsp;Twitter also supports “Do Not Track” (DNT).
