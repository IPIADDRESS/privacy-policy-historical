Respond.com knows how important your privacy is to you, and we appreciate you trusting us to handle your 
personal information responsibly and with integrity. The information we gather is used to provide you with 
a good experience and to help us improve our service for you. This document describes Respond.com's privacy 
policy and practices. <b>Please note that you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy 
by visiting and using Respond.com.</b>
<p>
<b>Our Commitment</b><br>
Respond.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our Buyers and Sellers. Since we collect certain types 
of information at the time our service is used, we have created this document to let our users know what 
information we collect, how the collected information is used to benefit our users, and how we protect the 
information that is provided to us. Rest assured, the privacy of our Buyers and Sellers is of utmost importance 
to us, and Respond.com will make every effort to ensure that our users are effectively informed and protected.
</p><p>
<b>Buyer Protection</b><br>
In order to submit a request to our community of Sellers, Buyers are required to provide us with an email 
address, as our service is email-based. The email address allows us to deliver Seller responses to the Buyer 
through email. Buyers' email addresses are never disclosed to third parties without consent. In certain categories, 
we may require a ZIP code to process a request for the purpose of geographically matching Buyers with Sellers. In 
some cases, Sellers don't use email and may need another means of contact, such as a phone or fax number. In such 
cases, we will ask for this additional information, and Sellers may then contact the Buyer directly. Note: Sellers 
may not contact the Buyer for any reason other than to address the information or assistance specifically requested 
in the Buyer request.
</p><p>
Respond.com also offers Buyers the opportunity to request news, special offer information, and/or information about 
promotions. These opportunities are completely optional, and Buyers are not obligated to take advantage of them. 
Respond.com will always ask before sending any information or promotional offering.
</p><p>
Respond.com reserves the right to provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and 
related Web site information to reputable third party vendors, but these statistics will not include any personal 
or identifying information. Respond.com reserves the right to post on its Web site the text in the "Details" 
box and additional product or service information inputted by Buyers in the request form. However, we will not post any 
information included in a Buyer request that includes any personally identifiable information. Buyers have the option to 
change or cancel requests at any time.
</p><p><br>

<b>Seller Protection</b><br>
To become a registered Seller with Respond.com, interested parties must provide us with both detailed Account 
Information (including name, address, and phone number) and general Contact Information. Account Information will 
be used for billing purposes and to provide updates about the Respond.com service. All Account Information is strictly 
confidential and will not be shared with Buyers without consent. Sellers may update or revise any account information by 
visiting the "Edit Profile" section of our Web site. Sellers may deactivate their account by contacting Customer 
Support at mailto:support@respond.com.
</p><p>
Contact information will be included in the Seller Response emails Respond.com sends on behalf of Sellers. This information 
is necessary for Buyers to contact Sellers directly. Sellers select how they wish to be contacted and may opt to be contacted 
in any or all of the following ways: phone, fax, email, or the Seller's Web site.
</p><p><br>
<b>We use cookies to enhance the Respond.com experience</b><br>
Cookies are small amounts of data delivered to a user's hard drive by a Web browser. The use of cookies enables Respond.com 
to process requests quickly, thereby enhancing the Respond.com experience for both Buyers and Sellers. Cookies are not required, 
but they are recommended. Sellers are especially encouraged to leave cookies on, as it becomes difficult to use the system 
without them.
</p><p><br>
<b>Information we collect</b><br>
Certain information is automatically tracked about our users when they use our Web site. This information includes the URL 
that the user just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), the URL that the user goes to next (whether this URL 
is on our site or not), the operating system the user is using, the browser the user is using, and the user's IP address. 
This information is collected to analyze trends, track user movement and use, gather broad demographic information, and 
administer the site. Many sites automatically collect this information.
</p><p><br>

<b>Note</b>
<br>
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. 
Except where noted, information is only for our registration and accounting purposes. Please note that if our services are 
accessed through one of our partner sites, we may share the information submitted through the partner's site with that 
specific partner, and we do not have control over and are not responsible for the privacy policies of our partners.
</p><p>
<b>We ask for your consent to our Privacy Policy</b><br>
By using Respond.com you agree to the above uses of your personal information. If at any time this policy changes, those 
changes will be posted to this page so that you are aware of our intent to better protect your privacy. You will be notified 
through email prior to any substantive changes in how we use your personal information. At that time, we will notify Sellers 
as to how they may cancel their service (if they wish), and we will notify Buyers as to how they may opt-out of receiving 
marketing communications (if they wish). We have obtained consent from all of the Buyers and Sellers who have provided us 
with the testimonials we occasionally post on our Web site.
</p><p><br>
<b>We ask for your comments and questions</b><br>
If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact Customer Support at 
<a href="mailto:support@respond.com?subject=Privacy Policy  ">support@respond.com</a>.
