		  <p>
		    DeepDyve, Inc. (“DeepDyve”) knows that you care about how your
		    personal information is used and shared, and takes your privacy seriously.
		    Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.
		    By visiting DeepDyve’s website at http://www.deepdyve.com (“deepdyve.com”),
		    or using any of our services or products, you acknowledge that you
		    accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.	      </p>
		  <h3>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover? </h3>
		  <p>This Privacy Policy covers DeepDyve’s
		    treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information")
		    DeepDyve gathers when you are accessing deepdyve.com and when you
		    use our services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies
		    that DeepDyve does not own or control, or to individuals DeepDyve does
		    not employ or manage. </p>
		  <h3>What Personal Information Does DeepDyve display or
		    Collect? </h3>
		  <p>The information
		    we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services,
		    and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that
		    can be used to interact with other users through deepdyve.com. In connection
		    with deepdyve.com, we may request and display some personal information
		    to other users and visitors of deepdyve.com, which allows users to identify
		    each other. We collect the following types of information from our users. </p>
		  <h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US: </h3>
		  <p>We receive and store any information
		    you enter on deepdyve.com or provide to us in any other way. The
		    types of Personal Information collected may include your name, gender,
		    e-mail address, cell phone number, occupation, hometown, college, personal
		    interests, and information about your use of the services on deepdyve.com.
		    You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you
		    may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The
		    Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding
		    to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing
		    the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials
		    and new features. You may modify or remove your personal information
		    at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit
		    your profile and account information. </p>
		  <h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY:</h3>
		  <ul>
		    <li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever
		      you interact with deepdyve.com or obtain services from us. DeepDyve
		      automatically receives and records information on our server logs
		      from your browser including your IP address, DeepDyve cookie information,
		      and the page you requested. We also record the details of your
		      transactions on deepdyve.com.</li>
	        <li>Generally, our service automatically
	          collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of
	          visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that
	          indicate how many people watched a particular show. DeepDyve only
	          uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure,
	          and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type
	          of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts
	          of deepdyve.com or services so that we can make deepdyve.com appealing
	          to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part
	          of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to
	          our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share
	          this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand
	          how often people use their services and deepdyve.com, so that they,
	          too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, DeepDyve
	          never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that
	          would identify you personally.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h3>E-MAIL COMMUNICATIONS: </h3>
		  <p>We often receive a confirmation when you open an
		    e-mail from DeepDyve if your computer supports this type of program.
		    DeepDyve uses this confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting
		    and helpful. We also compare our user list to lists received from other
		    companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users. </p>
		  <h3>WHAT ABOUT COOKIES?</h3>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your
		      computer’s
		      hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize
		      your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited
		      and by how many people. Most browsers have an option for turning
		      off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting
		      new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser
		      software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie
		      in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies
		      activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some
		      of deepdyve.com’s
		      most attractive features.</li>
	        <li>Ads appearing on deepdyve.com may be delivered
	          to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These
	          cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they
	          send you an online advertisement to compile information about you
	          or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks
	          to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they
	          believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers
	          the use of cookies by DeepDyve and does not cover the use of cookies
	          by any advertisers.</li>
		  </ul>

		    Information about our users is an integral part of our business.

		    or sell items to you through deepdyve.com. In other situations, DeepDyve
		    may provide services, or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses.
		    You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated
		    with your transaction, and we will share user information that is
		    related to such transactions with that affiliated business. </p>

		    your name and address. If you do not wish to receive these offers,
		    please send us an email to unsubscribe. </p>
		  <h4>Business Transfers:</h4>
		  <p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.
		    In these types of transactions, user information is typically one
		    of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if DeepDyve,
		    or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event
		    that DeepDyve goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information
		    would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.

		    our users, or others. This includes, without limitation, exchanging
		    information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection. </p>
