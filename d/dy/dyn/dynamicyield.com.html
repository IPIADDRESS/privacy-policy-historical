</h2>
&lt;&gt;
Dynamic Yield Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/.</a>
<p></p>
<p>
DY (the definition of which shall henceforth include all its wholly owned subsidiaries, including Dynamic Yield, Inc., Dynamic Yield UK Ltd., Dynamic Yield GmbH and Dynamic Yield APAC PTE Ltd.) respects the privacy of the users of its website at http://www.dynamicyield.com (the “Website”) and of its services, which operate across both DY’s Site as well as those of third parties (and together with the Website, collectively, the “Offering”), and is committed to protecting the information DY collects and/or is disclosed to it by the users of the Offering (“End Users” or “you“).We have created this privacy policy (this “Website Privacy Policy”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Acceptance of Terms</strong></span>
</p>
<p>
By visiting our Website, you are agreeing to the terms of this Website Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms and Conditions.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Information We Collect</strong></span>
</p>
<p>DY collects the following types of information from its End Users at several different points throughout the Offering:&nbsp; </p>
<ol start="1">
<li><p><u>In general</u></p>
<p>When you visit our Website or otherwise utilize our Offering you remain anonymous. That said, certain aspects of our Offering, whether deployed by others or by us, will require registration and/or the collection of information that is more personal in nature. In those cases, personal information, such as name, address, contact information and other information that may be protected by law as personally-identifiable information (“Personal Information” or “PII”) may be collected from you and stored in our databases, typically when you register to the Site, request support enter into a sales promotion or otherwise interact with us (for example through the “contact us” option). It should be made clear that you have no legal obligation to provide us with any PII and the submission of such information is entirely subject to your sole discretion and consent. However, if you will not provide us with the required information we may not be able to provide you with the information/services requested by you.</p>
</li><li><p><u>Other Information</u></p>
<p>In addition to the Personal Information, we may collect additional information (collectively, the “Other Information”). Such Other Information may include:</p>
<p>a. <u>From Your Activity</u></p>
<p>Information that we or our technology providers may automatically collect when you visit, access, and/or use the Website, such as your IP addresses, Internet service provider, domain server, type of computer, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections/features of our Offering that you visit/utilize, number of links you click while on the Website, search terms, and operating system. We may also collect statistical and other data related to your use of our Offering as well as information on Offering usage patterns. This information is collected and used as non-individually identifiable information.</p>
<p>b. <u>From Cookies and JavaScript Tags</u></p>
<p>We use session identifiers, web beacons, cookies, JavaScript tags, and other tracking technologies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on an End User’s hard drive containing information about the End User. We use these technologies to enhance the End User experience of our Offering, and as a result, these technologies may be deployed by DY in any portion of the DY Offering. Usually an Internet browser is set by default to accept cookies. If an End User rejects the cookie, he/she may still use our Offering, though certain features, tools and applications may be disabled or otherwise unavailable. We may also use cookies to track and monitor usage of the Offering by End Users for the marketing and quality improvement purposes. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer/device hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.</p>
<p>We may use JavaScript tags to trigger a sequence of events that includes viewing a first-party cookie (or setting that cookie if it does not already exist) and to help us tailor and optimize our DY Offering for both our End Users and enterprise clients.</p>
<p>
In addition to the foregoing, DY reserves the right to use the Google AdWords Remarketing Service (the “<strong>Google Service</strong>”) for advertising purposes. By using the Google Service, visitors of those sites, apps and other digital properties belonging to DY’s enterprise clients may see advertisements in third parties’ websites (including, without limitation on Google’s search results page or a site in the Google DisplNetwork). Any data collected by DY using the Google Service will be subject to both this Privacy Policy as well as Google’s Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>c. <u>Social Media Widgets</u></p>
<p>Our Offering includes Social Media features, such as the Facebook Like button. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and&nbsp;may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
</p>







</li><li><p><u>Third Party Service Providers</u></p>
<p>Our third-party service providers may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites, mobile websites and/or mobile applications across your various devices, in order to provide content and advertisements about goods and services of interest to you across those various devices. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices with respect to it, please: (1) visit &nbsp;the &nbsp;DAA opt-out program available <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> or the Evidon opt-out program available at <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/support/global-opt-out/">https://www.ghostery.com/support/global-opt-out/</a> 1.	to learn how to opt out of having your information collected in browsers for ad serving purposes; and (2) download the Ghostery Ad Control application, available for iOS and Android, to learn how to opt out of having your information collected in mobile apps.</p></li>
<li><p><u>External Websites</u></p>
<p>The Website may contain links to third-party websites. DY has no control over the privacy practices or the content of these websites. As such, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of those third-party websites. You should check the applicable third-party privacy policy and terms of use when visiting any other websites.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How We Use Information</strong></span></p>
<ol start="1">
<li><p><u>For Internet-based Advertising and Improvement of our End-Users Experience</u></p>
<p>We use the Personal Information and the Other Information (collectively, the “<u>Information</u>”) for purposes of analyzing trends, administering our Offering, improving our services, and to gather demographic information about our End User base as a whole. We also compile and store data and information and generate reports related to our End Users’ access to and use of our Offering. To the extent required under applicable data processing laws and regulations, any PII that we collect will be stored in our database and will be used in accordance with such applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>We typically analyze this information and organize it into user groups and audiences, based on factors such as age, gender, geography, interests and online actions. We then use these user groups and audiences, along with information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices, to design and deliver customized advertising campaigns or other relevant content. This is often referred to as Interest-Based Advertising. To enable the foregoing, the DY Solutions use technology including browser cookies, device identifiers, and other similar technologies to recognize a particular browser or device over time, to predict possible relationships among different browsers and devices and to then relay this information to our servers.</p>
<p>DY retains the End User data described above which is collected through our DY Solutions for purposes of Interest-Based Advertising for up to twenty-four (24) months from the date of its collection.</p>
</li>
<li><p><u>Email Communications</u></p>
<p>We do not send emails to anyone without permission , and we do not sell or rent email addresses to any unauthorized third party. This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet. If you believe that you have received an unsolicited email from us, please contact us at the e-mail below and we will investigate.
</p><p>
At any time, you have the ability to opt out of receiving marketing communications from DY, but you may not opt out of administrative emails. You can opt out either changing your e-mail preferences or using the link provided at the bottom of each email message or through any other means that is made available to you
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>How We Share the Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
We do not share, distribute, sell or rent any of your PII with/to third parties, including our enterprise clients, except in the following circumstances:
</p>
