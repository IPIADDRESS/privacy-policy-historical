<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:center"><b><u>Privacy
Policy<o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">Welcome to the Dynadot web
design, web hosting, and domain name registration service
("Service").<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Service
is made available subject to this Privacy Policy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>By using the Service, you agree, without limitation or
qualification, to be bound by this Privacy Policy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This policy may be updated from time to time, so please
check back here periodically.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><b>What information is
collected?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">When opening an account, the
Service collects your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, and
fax number. We collect this information because it may be necessary to contact
you about your account. Also, if you are registering a domain name, this
information is required by ICANN.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">In addition, when you open an
account, the Service asks you to create a username and password.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Service uses your username for
identification purposes only, and uses your password for verification of your
identity only.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">If you are placing an order,
the Service collects your credit card number and/or other billing information.
This information is used only to collect payment for services rendered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you are placing an order or logging
in to your customer account, the Service may log your IP address as a security
measure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you purchase digital
(SSL) certificate services, the Service also collects information about your
subject domain name registration.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">If you choose to participate in
our Refer-A-Friend program or other promotions to tell others about our
website, we will ask you to provide your friend's name and email address.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Service stores this information for
the sole purpose of sending a one-time email to your friend.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">If you submit a complaint to us
about our Service or about any one of our customers, the Service collects your
name and contact information, which may be used in our investigation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><b>What information is shared?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">The Service does not share your
information with any external third parties except when absolutely necessary,
as listed here in this Privacy Policy, or when authorized by you. We do not
sell information to mailing lists, or send advertisements on behalf of other
companies.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">If you are registering a domain
name, your contact information will be listed on the public Whois service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This listing is required by ICANN. When
placing an order, we submit your billing information to the payment
processor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">If you are purchasing a digital
(SSL) certificate, all information that you provide us that forms the content
of a digital certificate will be "published" on the internet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Publication of digital certificates in
an accessible location (a repository) is an integral part of enabling the
widespread use of digital certificates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Your digital certificate will be published in our repository, or that of
the providing vendor, so that a third party may access, review, and rely upon
your digital certificate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
should have no expectation of privacy regarding the content of your digital
certificate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The exact information
that appears in a digital certificate varies depending on the type of
certificate you purchase. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>Generally, this information includes your name or company
name, the subject domain name, country, status of certificate validity, and
dates of certificate validity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">If you use a forum or bulletin
board tool on our website, you should be aware that any personally identifiable
information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of
these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Service generates a user ID to be
associated with your account that is unique and different from your account
username, for the specific purpose of allowing you to use these forums without
disclosing your account information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The user ID may contain information related to your physical location or
name initials.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You have the option
of changing your forum user ID in your account settings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Service is not responsible for the
personally identifiable information you submit in these forums.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">If you purchase websites,
website templates, site building software, web hosting, or other such website
services, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you
submit on any such web pages can be read, collected, or used by third parties,
and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The Service is not responsible for the personally
identifiable information you disclose using any of these services.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">If you submit a complaint to us
about our Service or about any one of our customers, the Service reserves the
right to share your name and contact information with the party against whom
you are lodging the complaint, or with a law enforcement agency, as we deem
necessary in our sole discretion.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">Though the Service makes every
effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information
when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is
necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal
process served on us. (Please see our <u>Subpoena Policy</u>.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><b>What emails and postal mails
will you send me?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">We send emails updating you on
the status of your order. We may email you a renewal notice if a domain or
service is about to expire. We may email you about a matter directly concerning
your account. We may email you if we update a policy that affects your account.
If you registered a domain name, we will send you an email once a year to
remind you to update your contact information, as required by ICANN.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We may also send you a Dynadot
newsletter periodically, but you have the option of disabling this feature by
changing your account settings. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">If you purchased our Privacy
Service with your domain name registration, we may forward emails and postal
mails to you at your account contact information.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If you choose to participate in our Refer-A-Friend program
or other promotions to tell others about our website, we may email you on the
status of your participation in such programs or promotions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We will also send your friend a
one-time email about our website, listing you as the referrer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you submit a complaint or other form
of communication to us, we may email you a reply or status update.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><b>Do you use
"cookies"?</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">The Service uses cookies. A
cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information
about the user. We use cookies to remember where you are in our web site. For
example, by setting a cookie when you sign into your account, we know that you
are an authorized user. If you reject the cookie, you will not be able to enter
the account area of the site.</p>
