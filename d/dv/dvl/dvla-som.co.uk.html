	<strong>Your privacy</strong><br><br>
	This page explains our privacy policy and how we will use and protect any information about you that you give us when you visit this website.
	<br><br>

	<strong>The Data Protection Act</strong><br><br>
	Under the Data Protection Act, we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you. We use leading technologies and encryption software to safeguard your data, and keep strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it.
	<br><br>

	<strong>What information do we collect?</strong><br><br>
	We collect three kinds of information from visitors to dvlaregistrations.co.uk: feedback (through visitors emailing us), site referrals (via email a friend, etc) and site usage information, using cookies and page tagging techniques including JavaScript.
	<br><br>

	<strong>Feedback</strong><br><br>
	We welcome your feedback.<br><br>
	Should you send an email to us seeking advice or information that we are not in a position to give, we may forward your email on to a more appropriate department within the government for a response. If we do this we will send you an email informing you of our actions.
	<br><br>
	Once we have replied to you, we keep a record of your message for a maximum of two months for reference and audit purposes, after which we will delete it.
	<br><br>

	<strong>Site usage information</strong><br><br>

	<strong>Cookies</strong><br><br>

	Cookies are pieces of data that are often created when you visit a website, and which are stored in the cookies directory of your computer. Cookies are created when you visit dvlaregistrations.co.uk.
	<br><br>
	Our cookies store a random number and other information such as a date on your computer to help us count the number of times users return to our site.
	<br><br>
	The cookies do not contain any personal information about you, and they cannot be used to identify an individual user.
	<br><br>
	You can set your browser not to accept cookies. If you do not know how to do this, contact us, giving details on the type of browser you are using, and we will do our best to help. However some features of the site may not work as expected if all cookies are disabled.
	<br><br>

	<strong>Page tagging</strong><br><br>
	We use JavaScript to aggregate and analyse customer usage patterns on the dvlaregistrations.co.uk domain. This provides us with data on your usability and behaviour.  We use this information to make changes to the layout of the website and to the information in it. This does not collect any personal or identifiable information about users.
	<br><br>
	We sometimes tag pages on this website during promotion campaigns. These tags enable us to find out which advertisements are successful in bringing users to our internet site(s). With this technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable.
	<br><br>
	You can disable JavaScript on your computer. If you would like advice on how to disable JavaScript please contact us, giving details about the type of browser you use and we will do our best to help. Disabling JavaScript may affect your ability to access certain features on the website.

	<strong>What happens when I link to another site?</strong><br><br>
	Dvlaregistrations.co.uk contains links to other websites, both of government departments and of other organisations. This privacy policy applies only to our site, so you should always be aware when you are moving to another site and read the privacy statement of any other site(s) which collect personal information about you.
	<br><br>
	We do not pass on any personal information you have given us to any other site.
	<br><br>
	What happens when I access the dvlaregistrations.co.uk site through another site?
	<br><br>
	Where you are directed to the dvlaregistrations.co.uk site from another site (whether a third party site or a government site) we may receive personal information relating to you from the other site(s).  You should read the privacy policies applicable to such sites as these will govern the use of any personal information that you provide when accessing such sites and which is provided to dvlaregistrations.co.uk.
	<br><br>
	<strong>Security</strong><br><br>
	When accessing the 'my account' and purchasing sections of the website all information you send and receive is transferred thought a Secure Socker Layer connection (SSL). SSL creates a secure link between your browser and our server. We use SSL with 128-bit encryption which is widely accepted as the industry standard.<br>
	<br>
	SSL encrypts your personal information before it leaves your computer and guarantees that it is not altered between your computer and our server and unauthorised users cannot read it.
	<br><br>
