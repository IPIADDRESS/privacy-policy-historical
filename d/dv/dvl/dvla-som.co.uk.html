	<strong>Your privacy</strong><br><br>
	This page explains our privacy policy and how we will use and protect any information about you that you give us when you visit this website.
	<br><br>

	<strong>The Data Protection Act</strong><br><br>
	Under the Data Protection Act, we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you. We use leading technologies and encryption software to safeguard your data, and keep strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it.
	<br><br>

	<strong>What information do we collect?</strong><br><br>
	We collect three kinds of information from visitors to dvlaregistrations.direct.gov.uk: feedback (through visitors emailing us), site referrals (via email a friend, etc) and site usage information, using cookies and page tagging techniques including JavaScript.
	<br><br>

	<strong>Feedback</strong><br><br>
	We welcome your feedback.<br><br>
	Should you send an email to us seeking advice or information that we are not in a position to give, we may forward your email on to a more appropriate department within the government for a response. If we do this we will send you an email informing you of our actions.
	<br><br>
	Once we have replied to you, we keep a record of your message for a maximum of two months for reference and audit purposes, after which we will delete it.
	<br><br>
