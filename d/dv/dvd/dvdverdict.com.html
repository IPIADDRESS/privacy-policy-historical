The personal information we collect may include your name, company or organization name, e-mail, phone, mailing address, and credit card information.</p>

<p>The Site may collect certain information about your visit, such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the Site; the pages that you access while at the Site and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our site. This information is used to help improve the site, analyze trends, and administer the site.</p>

<h2>Use of your Personal Information</h2>

<p>The personal information collected on this Site will be used to operate the Site and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized.</p>

<p>In support of these uses, DVD Verdict may use personal information to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the Site, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Site to your particular preference or interests.</p>

<p>We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications.</p>

<p>We merge site-visitation data with anonymous demographic information for research purposes, and we may use this information in aggregate to provide more relevant content. If you decline permission, we will not provide you the personalized service and won't merge your personal information with site-visitation data.</p>

<p>DVD Verdict may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of DVD Verdict; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of DVD Verdict employees or agents, users of DVD Verdict products or services, or members of the public.</p>
