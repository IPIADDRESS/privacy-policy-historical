We use this information to contact the user about services on the Sites for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as user name and password), but this practice is encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on the site and analyze our processes for fairness to all demographic groups.  For sites where you have a user account, you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user name and password. If you believe that confidentiality has been compromised, contact webmaster@ddiworld.com. </p>

<h3 class="Heading2">
<a name="pgfId-1017149"></a>Profiles</h3>
<p class="Body">
<a name="pgfId-1016820"></a>Information provided by users of the Sites is stored in a user profile. Subsequently collected information related to that user profile that we collect through cookies, log files, and/or third parties is tied to the profile to improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to the Sites and to direct pertinent content to them. We do not share your profile with other third parties.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="Heading2">
<a name="pgfId-1016821"></a>Information Use </h3>
<p class="Body">
<a name="pgfId-1016823"></a>Web Site visitors provide all personal information on a voluntary basis through visible means of data entry or collection. Any personal information, such as your email and/or postal addresses, telephone numbers and other data, becomes available to DDI only when voluntarily submitted by you. Once DDI receives such information, it is sent to the particular office at DDI that is equipped to respond to your request or comment. We do not rent, sell, or exchange information about you to third parties, except as otherwise noted in this privacy statement. </p>
<p class="Body">
<a name="pgfId-1017167"></a>DDI may also use such information to provide advance notice of events and new products and services. DDI does not share any personally identifiable information with any other individual or organization for any purpose, except as otherwise noted in this privacy statement. DDI uses the collected information to improve the content of our Web Site, to enhance existing products and services, and to communicate with you more effectively. However, despite all best efforts, Internet and email communications are never 100% confidential, and it is possible that information transmitted to us may be read or obtained by other parties. We do not release any of your information for any purpose other than its intended use.  </p>
<div>
<h5 class="Heading3">
<a name="pgfId-1002435"></a>Cookies</h5>
<p class="Body">
<a name="pgfId-1017180"></a>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site except when personal information is stored on a voluntary basis through the process of logging into the Web Site with a user name and password, in which case the information can be used to pre-populate user information into form fields presented by the Web Site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies in the DDI Internet Site.</p>
<p class="Body">
<a name="pgfId-1017181"></a>For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the users' experience on the Sites. Persistent cookies can be removed by following the instruction outlined in the user's Internet browser Help. More information on cookies and the use of cookies by Web Sites can be found at www.cookiecentral.com.</p>
<p class="Body">
<a name="pgfId-1017182"></a>By setting a cookie on our site, users do not have to specify a password more than once, thereby saving time while on the Sites. If users reject the cookie, they may still use the Sites. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of the Sites. See the Profile section.</p>
<p class="Body">
<a name="pgfId-1017184"></a>Some of our third party business service providers (e.g., live help chat, aggregate traffic analysis and search engines) use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h5 class="Heading3">
<a name="pgfId-1017186"></a>Online Customer Service Chat Cookies</h5>
<p class="Body">
<a name="pgfId-1017187"></a>Our third party online customer service chat asp service provider uses cookies to link profile information (submitted by individuals wishing to contact DDI ) with the ongoing chat sessions managed by DDI's client representatives (operators). By setting a cookie, users do not have to enter their profile information more than once, thereby saving time while on the chat session. Other statistical information about how our Web sites are used is collected to assist the user with their customer service experience.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h5 class="Heading3">
<a name="pgfId-1017189"></a>Search Engine Cookies</h5>
<p class="Body">
<a name="pgfId-1017190"></a>Our third party business service provider uses cookies to link visits to our site with click-through from pay-per-click sponsored ads, placed by DDI on external search engine sites. They work by placing a cookie on a user's computer when he/she clicks on one of our pay-per-click sponsored ads. Then, if the user reaches one of DDI's designated conversion pages, the cookie is connected to our web page. When a match is made, the third party business service provider records a successful conversion for DDI. </p>
<p class="Body">
<a name="pgfId-1017192"></a>Our third party business service provider does not associate a user's search activity with his/her ad click history. The information collected is only in aggregate form  and is not tied to any personal information.</p>
<p class="Body">
<a name="pgfId-1017194"></a>Users who don't want to participate in tracking activities can not accept this cookie by setting their Internet browser user preferences. These users will simply not be included in our conversion tracking statistics.</p>
<p class="Body">
<a name="pgfId-1017195"></a>This Privacy Statement covers the use of cookies by www.ddiworld.com and www.ddi.com and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h5 class="Heading3">
<a name="pgfId-1002443"></a>Log Files</h5>
<p class="Body">
<a name="pgfId-1002446"></a>Like most standard Web Site servers we use log files to collect statistical information about how our Web Sites are used. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring / exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We also use cookies on our site to track return visitors to our Web site, which can then be compared to statistical information about how our Web Sites are used. The information we collect is used to analyze trends, administer the Sites, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. The data is not linked to personally identifiable information. </p>
<p class="Body">
<a name="pgfId-1017241"></a>We may choose to track the above log file information against individual user profiles only when the user has voluntarily set a uniquely identifiable cookie by logging on with a user name and password to the Site.</p>

<p class="Body">
<a name="pgfId-1009274"></a>From time to time, we send electronic communications to users registered on the Sites. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications unless these communications are essential service related announcements. Please see the sections Service Announcements and Choice / Opt-out.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h5 class="Heading3">
<a name="pgfId-1002451"></a>Service Announcements</h5>
<p class="Body">
<a name="pgfId-1002452"></a>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h5 class="Heading3">
<a name="pgfId-1002454"></a>Customer Service</h5>
<p class="Body">
<a name="pgfId-1002455"></a>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the user's wishes.</p>

<h5 class="Heading3">
