<h3>Development Dimensions International's Privacy Statement Information Collection and Use<br>
2 of 7 9/21/04</h3>

<a name="Collection"></a>
<h2>1.0 Information Collection and Use</h2>

<h3>1.1 Information Collection</h3>

<p>DDI is the owner of the information collected on the Sites covered by this Privacy Statement. DDI collects information from our users at several different points on the Sites.</p>

<p>In order to use full functionality offered by the Sites, a user may be required to provide certain personal information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on the Sites for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as user name and password), but this practice is encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on the site and analyze our processes for fairness to all demographic groups. For sites where you have a user account, you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user name and password. If you believe that confidentiality has been compromised, contact webmaster@ddiworld.com.</p>

<h3>1.2 Email A Colleague</h3>

<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a colleague about our site, we will ask you for your colleague's name and email address.</p>

<p>We will automatically send your colleague a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. DDI stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.</p>

<p>Your colleague can contact us at webmaster@ddiworld.com to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

<h3>1.3 Submit Your Resume for Careers Opportunities</h3>

<p>If you choose to use our online resume submission service to apply for a career opportunity with DDI and in order to be considered for a Career Opportunity with DDI, we require you to supply your cover letter, an attached resume document (including latest address, phone, and email information), and the DDI regional office(s) to which you wish to submit your resume. We will automatically send you a one-time email confirming that resume submission. DDI stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking your resume submission.</p>

<p>You can contact us at resumes@ddiworld.com to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

<a name="Correcting"></a>
<h2>2.0 Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</h2>

<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information as noted below.</p>

<p>Go to www.ddiworld.com and click "My DDI Homepage". Then, click My DDI Profile. Or, contact the person listed under Contact Information on the last page of this statement.</p>

<p>Log onto the site and change the information immediately or contact the technical support staff as designated on the site or webmaster@ddiworld.com. DDI will respond to your request 10 business days in the US or within 30 business days outside the US (International).</p>

<a name="Profiles"></a>
<h2>3.0 Profiles</h2>

<p>Information provided by users of the Sites is stored in a user profile. Subsequently collected information related to that user profile that we collect through cookies, log files, and/or third parties is tied to the profile to improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to the Sites and to direct pertinent content to them. We do not share your profile with other third parties.</p>

<h3>Development Dimensions International's Privacy Statement Information Use<br>
3 of 7 9/21/04</h3>

<a name="Use"></a>
<h2>4.0 Information Use</h2>

<p>Web Site visitors provide all personal information on a voluntary basis through visible means of data entry or collection. Any personal information, such as your email and/or postal addresses, telephone numbers and other data, becomes available to DDI only when voluntarily submitted by you. Once DDI receives such information, it is sent to the particular office at DDI that is equipped to respond to your request or comment. We do not rent, sell, or exchange information about you to third parties, except as otherwise noted in this privacy statement.</p>

<p>DDI may also use such information to provide advance notice of events and new products and services. DDI does not share any personally identifiable information with any other individual or organization for any purpose, except as otherwise noted in this privacy statement.</p>

<p>DDI uses the collected information to improve the content of our Web Site, to enhance existing products and services, and to communicate with you more effectively. However, despite all best efforts, Internet and email communications are never 100% confidential, and it is possible that information transmitted to us may be read or obtained by other parties. We do not release any of your information for any purpose other than its intended use.</p>

<h3>4.1 Cookies</h3>

<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site except when personal information is stored on a voluntary basis through the process of logging into the Web Site with a user name and password, in which case the information can be used to pre-populate user information into form fields presented by the Web Site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies in the DDI Internet Site.</p>

<p>For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the users' experience on the Sites. Persistent cookies can be removed by following the instruction outlined in the user's Internet browser Help. More information on cookies and the use of cookies by Web Sites can be found at www.cookiecentral.com.</p>

<p>By setting a cookie on our site, users do not have to specify a password more than once, thereby saving time while on the Sites. If users reject the cookie, they may still use the Sites. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of the Sites. See the Profile section.</p>

<p>Some of our third party business service providers (e.g., live help chat, aggregate traffic analysis and search engines) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>

<h3>4.2 Online Customer Service Chat Cookies</h3>

<p>Our third party online customer service chat asp service provider uses cookies to link profile information (submitted by individuals wishing to contact DDI) with the ongoing chat sessions managed by DDI's client representatives (operators). By setting a cookie, users do not have to enter their profile information more than once, thereby saving time while on the chat session. Other statistical information about how our Web sites are used is collected to assist the user with their customer service experience.</p>

<h3>4.3 Search Engine Cookies</h3>

<p>Our third party business service provider uses cookies to link visits to our site with click-through from pay-per-click sponsored ads, placed by DDI on external search engine sites. They work by placing a cookie on a user's computer when he/she clicks on one of our pay-per-click sponsored ads. Then, if the user reaches one of DDI's designated conversion pages, the cookie is connected to our web page. When a match is made, the third party business service provider records a successful conversion for DDI.</p>

<p>Our third party business service provider does not associate a user's search activity with his/her ad click history. The information collected is only in aggregate form and is not tied to any personal information.</p>

<p>Users who don't want to participate in tracking activities can not accept this cookie by setting their Internet browser user preferences.</p>

<p>These users will simply not be included in our conversion tracking statistics.</p>

<p>This Privacy Statement covers the use of cookies by the URL's named above and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.</p>

<h3>Development Dimensions International's Privacy Statement Communications from the Site<br>
4 of 7 9/21/04</h3>

<h3>4.4 Log Files</h3>

<p>Like most standard Web Site servers we use log files to collect statistical information about how our Web Sites are used. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring / exit pages, platform type, date/ time stamp, and number of clicks. We also use cookies on our site to track return visitors to our Web site, which can then be compared to statistical information about how our Web Sites are used. The information we collect is used to analyze trends, administer the Sites, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. The data is not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>We may choose to track the above log file information against individual user profiles only when the user has voluntarily set a uniquely identifiable cookie by logging on with a user name and password to the Site.</p>

<a name="Communications"></a>
<h2>5.0 Communications from the Site</h2>

<h3>5.1 Special Offers and Updates</h3>

<p>From time to time, we send electronic communications to users registered on the Sites. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications unless these communications are essential service related announcements.</p>

<p>Please see the sections Service Announcements and Choice / Opt-out.</p>

<h3>5.2 Service Announcements</h3>

<p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.</p>

<h3>5.3 Customer Service</h3>

<p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the user's wishes.</p>

<a name="Sharing"></a>
<h2>6.0 Sharing</h2>

<h3>6.1 Legal Disclaimer</h3>

<p>Though we make industry standard and reasonable effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on the Sites.</p>

<p>We do not share personal information with Third Parties except as otherwise noted in this Statement.</p>

<h3>6.2 Third Party Intermediaries and Service Providers</h3>

<p>We use third party intermediaries to provide certain services. For example, we use an outside shipping company to ship orders or a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>

<h3>6.3 Newsletter Subscriptions</h3>

<p>Through the various services provided by our third party newsletter publishing asp service provider for managing email newsletter subscriptions, they also collect and store visitor information in a secure and private manner on behalf of DDI. This information includes, but is not limited to, email address lists, articles, survey answers, letters, and usage statistics. This information is owned by DDI and is not accessible to any other third parties.</p>

<h3>6.4 Online Customer Service Chat</h3>

<p>Through the various services provided by our third party online customer service chat asp service provider for managing online chat sessions, they also collect and store user information in a secure and private manner on behalf of DDI.</p>

<p>When the online customer service chat first begins, users are asked to enter their names in whatever format or detail they prefer. During the chat, users enter into a live question and answer session with a DDI operator. Our third party online customer service chat asp service provider maintains dialogue transcripts of these chats. After the chat, Users may be asked to fill out an exit survey in order to obtain valuable feedback about DDI service. Filling out the exit survey is completely voluntary. The surveys may ask for contact information (e.g., email address) and for demographic information (e.g., city, state and zip code).</p>

<p>Our third party online customer service chat asp service provider also collects data through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout their site.</p>

<p>Our third party online customer service chat asp service provider accesses the information they collect (for DDI) for certain purposes (for example, to aggregate the information, to monitor the use of the service during certain chats and for other lawful purposes). A user's information, including personally identifiable information, will not be shared with other third parties.</p>

<h3>6.5 Online Surveys</h3>

<p>Through the various services provided by our third party online survey asp service provider for managing online surveys, they also collect and store user information in a secure and private manner on behalf of DDI.</p>

<p>Our third party online survey asp service provider allows DDI to create surveys and questionnaires for distribution to potential survey respondents.</p>

<p>Our third party online survey asp service provider maintains respondent information that may include information about DDI survey recipients, and other demographics and data useful to DDI. They access the information they collect (for DDI) for certain purposes (for example, to aggregate and compile the information and for other lawful purposes). A user's information, including personally identifiable information, will not be shared with other third parties.</p>

<h3>6.6 Business Transitions</h3>

<p>In the event another company goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquiring DDI, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. See Choice/Opt-out.</p>

<h3>6.7 Choice/Opt-out</h3>

<p>Our users are given the opportunity to `opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our Sites at the point where we ask for information. Users who provide information requested by the Sites, or who continue to use the Sites after having an opportunity to review this Privacy Statement, thereby consent to the terms of this Privacy Statement and to DDI's use of the information it collects as described in this Privacy Statement. Those who do not agree to this Privacy Statement may not use the Site.</p>

<p>Users of the Sites are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.</p>

<p>Our third party online customer service chat asp service provider gives users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include opting not to engage in chat sessions and opting not to provide identifiable information during chat sessions.</p>

<h3>6.8 Links</h3>

<p>Sites can contain links to other sites. Please be aware that DDI is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the Privacy Statements of each and every Web Site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by the Sites.</p>

<h3>6.9 Surveys</h3>

<p>From time to time the Sites may request information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Sites. See "Third Party Intermediaries and Service Providers/ Online Surveys"</p>

<p>When registration forms ask users to enter personally identifiable information, that information is encrypted and is protected with SSL. While on a secure page, such as our DDIWorld membership form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, go to www.verisign.com.</p>

<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect personally identifiable information online, (we also provide reasonable and timely effort to protect user information offline). All of our users' information, not just the personally identifiable information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Those employees are required to respect the confidentiality of our visitor's personal data.</p>

<p>The servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment in a locked facility.</p>

<a name="Enhancement"></a>
<h2>8.0 Enhancement of Marketing Profile for DDI Internet site only</h2>

<p>We purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and provide pertinent information we think our users would be interested in. We use this information to enhance or overlay the `profile' of individual users.</p>

<p>This aggregate marketing data is therefore tied to the users' personally identifiable information.</p>

<a name="Changes"></a>
<h2>9.0 Changes to the Privacy Statement</h2>

<p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Statement. When we do, we will post those material changes on the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>

<p>If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our Web Site for 30 days.</p>

<a name="Protection"></a>
<h2>10.0 Protection of Children's Information</h2>

<p>The Sites do not publish content or collect data that is directed at children.</p>

<a name="Complaints"></a>
<h2>11.0 Complaints Resolution</h2>

<p>If you are concerned about how your personal information is being used, you have a right to complain and to expect your complaint to be handled in a sensitive and effective manner. At any time, you can contact us to inquire about the handling, use or disclosure of your personal information by sending an email to the persons listed under Contact Information.
