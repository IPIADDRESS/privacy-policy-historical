<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. We use your information to improve the quality and design of DraftDay and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services, such as by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. We may anonymize or aggregate your information for business purposes, including for reporting and research. Anonymous and/or aggregated data does not identify you, and we may use and disclose such information without limitation.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #006699;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">When DraftDay Discloses Information</span></strong></span></p>
<p>Our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, agents, or other businesses or persons may have authorized access to your information (such as name or email address) for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf, including by using the information to make improvements to the services they provide. We may share your personally identifiable information third parties for their commercial or marketing use with your consent or as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to your requests for customer service. As agreed in our Terms of Service, we may use personal information about you (such as your name and photo) in connection with marketing and publicity purposes. We will publish a profile page that includes your username, the date you became a member, your stats from previous contests and, if you uploaded one, your profile picture. When you participate in a contest, we may publish your username on a list of the contest participants, along with a link to your profile page. We also may share personally identifiable information in other situations with your consent.</p>
<p>DraftDay also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information that DraftDay believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability or harm, to investigate and respond to third-party claims or allegations, to respond to a subpoena, legal order, or official request, to protect the security or integrity of our Service, and to protect the rights, property, or safety of DraftDay, our Users or others. Information also may be shared as described in the Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy section below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #006699;"><strong>Your Choices</strong></span></p>
<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through DraftDay, in which case DraftDay may not be able to provide certain services to you.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we reserve the right to take reasonable steps (such as requesting your password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and account information at all times.</p>
<p>Please contact DraftDay with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out choices by using the contact us form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #006699;"><strong>Data Security</strong></span></p>
<p>DraftDay uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to DraftDay and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #006699;"><strong>Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy<br></strong></span></p>
<p>In the event that DraftDay is involved in a merger, acquisition, sale, bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, or other change of control, there may be a disclosure of your personally identifiable information to another entity related to such event, and we may not control how the information is treated, transferred, or used by that entity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #006699;"><strong>Third Party Advertising and Analytics Companies</strong></span></p>
<p>Certain ads appearing on DraftDay are delivered to Members/Groups by our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may use cookies and other automated technologies to collect data, including the technologies described in the “Information We Collect” section above. Doing this allows the ad companies to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, the ad companies may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and measure your interaction with each ad. This information allows ad companies to deliver targeted advertisements that may be of increased interest to you, both on our Service and elsewhere online. Note that we also work with third-party analytics companies to collect data on our Service through cookies and other automated means. In some cases, the third parties mentioned in this section may maintain the information they collect in personally identifiable form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #006699;"><strong>Publicity</strong></span></p>
