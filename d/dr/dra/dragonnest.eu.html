        <p>5.2 We may also share your Personal Data with our third party providers that provide customer support services in connection with goods, Content and Services distributed via Cherry Credits.

        <p>5.4 The Cherry community includes forums, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with each other. When posting a message to the forum, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available online; therefore, you are doing so at your own risk. If your Personal Data is posted on one of our community forums against your will, please contat us via Cherry Messenger to request its removal.</p>
        <p>5.5 Cherry Credits may release Personal Data to comply with court orders or laws and regulations that require us to disclose such information.</p>

        <h3>6. How we protect your personal information</h3>

        <p>We take great precautions to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
        <p>We use Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. In order to make any purchase, you must use an TLS-enabled browser such as Microsoft Edge, Firefox or Chrome etc. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal and payment information while it's transmitted over the Internet.</p>
        <p>You can also help us by taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords regularly and make sure you use a secure web browser. In addition, never reveal to any one your 6-digit security PIN and secret question / answer.</p>



        <h3>7. Integrity of your personal information</h3>
        
        <p>It is very important to ensure that all submitted personal information during registration is accurate, complete, and up to date for the purposes for which it is used. Please note that while you have the right to access, correct and update personal information, certain information is non-changeable upon submission for security reasons. Do ensure that your contact information and preferences are up-to-date by updating your Cherry account whenever necessary.</p>
        <p>Your email address provided may be used to inform you of our latest news and announcements. You may opt out of this by unchecking the newsletter box during registration, via the Manage Account function or choosing to unsubscribe from our mailing list.</p>

        <h3>8. How can you verify, modify or delete your personal information</h3>

        <p>You may verify and modify your Personal Data that we hold about you by logging into your Cherry account, or contacting our customer support via Cherry Messenger.</p>
        <p>If we process your Personal Data, we shall endeavor to ensure by implementing suitable measures that your Personal Data is accurate and up-to-date for the purposes for which it was collected. If your Personal Data is inaccurate or incomplete, you can change the information you provided via the above two means.</p>
        <p>You may request the deletion of Personal Data concerning you if the reason why we could collect it (see section 2 and 3 above) does not exist anymore or if there is another legal ground for its deletion. For individual items of Personal Data please edit them through your Cherry account or request the deletion via our customer support using Cherry Messenger. You are required to provide your personal identity information for the deletion request to verify that you are the genuine owner of the Cherry account.</p>
        <p>As a result of deleting your Cherry account, you will lose access to all Cherry Credits services, including your Cherry account, e-wallet, Cherry Game accounts, game-related information linked to the Cherry account and the possibility to access other services you are using the Cherry account for.</p>
        <p>We allow you to restore your Cherry account with a grace period of 30 (thirty) calendar days from the moment you request deletion of your Cherry account. This functionality allows you not to lose your account by mistake, because of your loss of your account credentials or due to hacking. During the suspension period, we will be able to finalize financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the Cherry account deletion request. After the grace period, Personal Data associated with your account will be deleted subject to section 4. above</p>
        <p>In some cases, deletion of your Cherry account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated. Namely, if your account has a business relationship with Cherry Credits, such as due to your work for Cherry Credits or a game developer, you will only be able to delete your Cherry account after you have transferred this role to another user or have dissolved the business relationship. In some cases, considering the complexity and number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended, but for no longer than three further months.</p>

Cherry Credits shall have no obligation or responsibility regarding any content derived, obtained, accessed within through or outside of our websites.
