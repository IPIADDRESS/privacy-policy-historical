                          for our users. Some of these events coincide with actual
                          real life holidays, such as Valentine’s Day,
                          other events are made up as we go along. We use the
                          newsletter to notify our users of all the current events,
                          changes, improvements, upgrades, new characters, etc.
                          In addition, occasionally we may notify our users of
                          new products and services that DragonFable has designed
                          and made available exclusively to our users. In addition,

                          <span class="subheader">CHILDRENS’S PRIVACY POLICY<a name="7"></a></span><br>
                          DragonFable encourages parents and legal guardians
                          to spend time online with their children. We urge parents
                          and legal guardians to instruct their children to never
                          give out their personal information online without
                          permission. We also recognize a special need to protect
                          personal information obtained from children. In compliance
                          with Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
                          (“COPPA”), we have adopted the following
                        policies regarding children under the age of 14 (“Children”):</p>
                        <p> <strong>Type and Use of Information Collected from Children</strong><br>
                        Parents of children under the age of 13 who wish to allow their children access to the Site or Services must create an account on behalf of their child. When you create a child’s account, you certify that you are at least 18 years old and that you are the legal guardian of the child using the account. Accordingly, as the legal guardian, it is your responsibility to determine whether any of the Service areas and/or Content are appropriate for your child. By creating a child’s account, you also give your child permission to access many areas of the Service, including email and message boards (among others). By creating a child’s account, you do not give your child permission to purchase account upgrades or other items by credit card or any other means. To purchase account upgrades or other products, you must represent that you are at least 18 years old. When you purchase account upgrades or other products on behalf of a child under the age of 18, you certify that you are at least 18 years old and that you are the legal guardian of the child. </p>
                        <p>To create a Subscriber Account, DragonFable does require an e-mail address
  as well as the parent’s correct billing information as outlined under
  the Subscriber Accounts section. The setting up of the account by the parents
  is considered an actual verifiable consent by the parent for the child to use
  this website as required by COPPA.<br>
  <br>
  For Subscriber Accounts, we use your child’s e-mail address for the following
  purposes:<br>
  1. To send a confirmation notice to the child of their
                          character registration and password information.<br>
                          2.	Upon the child’s request, to send the user
                          password information when the child has lost or forgotten
                          the password.<br>
                          3. In response to any questions, concerns or problems
                          that the child contacted DragonFable about.* <br>
                          4. To contact the child about any problem with the
                          child’s account or conduct in the game.<br>
                          5.	To send out a newsletter**.</p>
                        <p>*We recognize that young children may inadvertently
                          give out personal information in addition to their
                          e-mail address when contacting us with any questions,
                          problems, or concerns they have encountered while playing
                          the game. We do not collect or use any such additional
                          personal information acquired in this manner unless
                          it is necessary for us to respond to the problem or
                          question or concern. We do not divulge any such information
                          to any third parties unless we are required to do so
                          by law, court order or subpoena.</p>
                        <p>** DragonFable game is unique in a sense that we design
                          and run numerous special events that keep the game
                          constantly fresh, challenging, fun and interesting
                          for our users. Some of these events coincide with actual
                          real life holidays, such as Valentine’s Day,
                          other events are made up as we go along. We use the
                          newsletter to notify our users of all the upcoming
                          events, changes, improvements, upgrades, new characters,
                          etc. In addition, occasionally we may notify our users
                          of new products and services that DragonFable has designed
                          and made available exclusively to our users. DragonFable
                          may also forward promotions and advertisements from
                          our sponsors, however DragonFable will not release
                          any personal information to the sponsors directly.</p>
                        <p> If a child desires to upgrade his/her account to
                          Subscriber Status, a parent or legal guardian will
                          be required to divulge additional reasonably necessary
                          information as described above under Subscriber Accounts.<br>
                          <br>
                          DragonFable does not sell or knowingly divulge your
                            child’s information to advertisers or any other
                            third parties, unless we are required to share your
                            child’s information with a third party in order
                            to comply with law, to comply with a court order
                            or subpoena; to enforce our site or game rules; to
                            protect the safety and security of our users and
                            our Web sites.</p>
                        <p>Also, please note that DragonFable does not condition
                          a child’s participation in an online activity
                          on the child providing more personal information than
                          is reasonably necessary for the activity.</p>
                        <p> <strong>Notification and Verifiable Parental Consent</strong><br>
                          For Subsciber Accounts, the receipt of payment is considered actual, verifiable
  consent from the parents to the child’s use of our website and to any
  information that was divulged as reasonably necessary to process payments,
  verify and maintain the account.</p>
                        <p> <strong>How can parents access, change or delete personally
                          identifiable information about their children?</strong><br>
