</strong><p></p>
<div class="info-box-yellow">Dragonicum proactively renews the security on online solutions against threats to ensure that they are resilient against abuse by hackers to gain information.</div>
<p>The Dragonicum Infrastructure is designed to comply with industry-accepted security best practices. Our systems are hosted in world-class security data center facilities and provide for secured access control to limit the potential for abuse by unauthorized third parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This control involves Authentification and Verification of Users and Members before registration, and Authentification by means of usernames and password before information can be accessed. Authentification is further protected for transmission over unsecured public networks, by using industry-standard encryption algorithms, <br>
a cryptographic protocol which provides secure communication on the Internet for such things as Web-Browsing, Email, Internet-faxing and other data transfers.&nbsp;</p>

<span>Dragonicum.com will check if the company is legally registered, and that business address and contact information operates on a daily basis.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">2. Verification – is the person employed or associated with the company?</span></strong><br>

Fraud over digital cash has been a pressing issue in recent years.</p>
