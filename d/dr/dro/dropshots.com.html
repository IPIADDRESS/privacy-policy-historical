<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses</p>

<h4>Personal Information.</h4>
<p>When you purchase products and/or services from our web site, through the mail, or over the phone, as well as when you participate in our surveys, occasional sweepstakes or promotions and/or perks program, you provide us with information.

   We also share sales information with third parties to properly process services and returns, place new supplier orders and perform other administrative functions.</p>

<h4>Legal Requirements.</h4>
<p>On rare occasions, we may be required to disclose personal information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or as required by applicable laws.
   Also, if the ownership of DropShots were to change, customer information pertinent to that business's operations would likely be transferred to, or licensed for use by, the new owner.</p>

<h4>Change Happens.</h4>
<p>DropShots is continually improving its services, offerings, and products to you.
   This includes adding new functionality and features to its websites and/or catalogs.
   Because of these changes, changes in technology and/or the law, this Privacy Policy will change from time to time.
