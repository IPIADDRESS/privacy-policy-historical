                    <p>Cookies are used for authentication, tracking, and maintaining user-specific information (preferences, shopping cart, etc.) and often contain a unique and anonymous identifier.</p>
                    <p>Browsers only allow web sites to interact with their own cookies, not those from other web sites. The settings in your browser allow you to accept or decline cookies depending upon your preferences.</p>

                    <h4>Web Beacons</h4>
                    <p>A web beacon is a small transparent gif image that is embedded in an HTML page or email used to track when the page or email has been viewed.</p>

                    <h4>Google Analytics</h4>
                    <p>This website uses Google Analytics; a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google").

The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address which we do not link to any personally identifiable information) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for us and providing other services to us relating to website activity and internet usage.

                    <h4>Social Media Features and Widgets</h4>
                    <p>Websites offered by Think Productivity may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the Share this button.

                    <p>We will keep your information secure by taking appropriate technical and organisational measures against its unauthorised or unlawful processing and against its accidental loss, destruction or damage. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number to purchase Think Productivity products and services), we encrypt such information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
