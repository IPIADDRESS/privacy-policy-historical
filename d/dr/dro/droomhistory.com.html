                            <strong>1. COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND OTHER INFORMATION</strong>
                            <p>This Privacy Policy extends to both, Users who visit the Website but do not register on the Website and as well as Users who are Registered on the Website and transact business on the Website. When You use Our Website, We collect and store Your personal information which is provided by You from time to time. Our primary goal in doing so is to provide You a safe, efficient, smooth and customized experience. This allows Us to provide services and features that most likely meet Your needs, and to customize Our Website to make Your experience safer and easier. More importantly, while doing so We collect personal information from You that We consider necessary for achieving this purpose.</p>
                            <p>In general, You can browse the Website without telling Us who You are or revealing any personal information about Yourself. Once You give Us Your personal information, You are not anonymous to Us. Where possible, We indicate which fields are mandatory/ required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the Website. We may automatically track certain information about You based upon Your behaviour on Our Website. We use this information to do internal research on Our Users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve Our Users. This information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. This information may include, but is not limited to, the URL that You just came from (whether this URL is on Our Website or not), which URL You next go to (whether this URL is on Our Website or not), Your computer browser information, and Your IP address.</p>

                            <p>By using the Website or the Services, you consent to collection, storage, and use of the personal information you provide (including any changes thereto as provided by you or your representatives, nominees, assigns) for any of the services that we offer. Users of the Website agree and acknowledge that they are being made fully aware by the Website / Droom about the manner and the purposes for which, the information so shared /disclosed by them will be used.</p>
                            <p>A "cookie" is a small piece of information stored by a Web server on a Web browser so it can be later read back from that browser. The acceptance of cookies is not a requirement for visiting the Website. However, We would like to point out that some functionality on the Website is only possible with the activation of cookies. Cookies are tiny text files which identify Your computer to Our server as a unique User when You visit certain pages on the Website and they are stored by Your Internet browser on Your computer's hard drive. Usually, cookies contain two pieces of information: a site name and a unique User ID. Cookies cannot be used alone to identify You, although they may be used to identify Your IP address. We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Website to help analyse Our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety.</p>
                            <p>We also use cookies to allow You to enter Your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help Us provide information that is targeted to Your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from Your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline Our cookies if Your browser permits, although in that case You may not be able to use certain features on the Website and You may be required to re-enter Your password more frequently during a session. Additionally, You may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of the Website that are placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.
                            If You choose to buy/ transact on the Website, We collect information about Your buying/ transaction behaviour. When You transact with Us, We also collect some additional information, such as a billing address, a credit/ debit card number and a credit / debit card expiration date and/ or other payment instrument details and tracking information from cheques or money orders.</p>

                            <p>If You choose to post messages on Our message boards, chat rooms or other message areas or leave feedback, We will collect that information You provide to Us. We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law. Further, we may share the feedback or User requirements through a lead generation form which we may share with third parties or the Company’s internal team.</p>
                            <p>If You send Us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other Users or third parties send Us correspondence about Your activities or postings on the Website, We may collect such information into a file specific to You. We collect personally identifiable information (email address, name, phone number, etc.) from You when You set up a free account with Us. While you can browse some sections of our Website without being a registered member, certain activities (such as placing an order) do require registration. We do use Your contact information to send You correspondence based on Your interests.</p>
                            <p>By sharing / posting such&nbsp;personally identifiable information&nbsp;on the Website, you hereby unconditionally and without any riders, agree and acknowledge that Droom may store and at time, if required, share the personal information so provided by You with other Users for the purposes of providing the Services on this Website.</p>
                            <p>We will only keep Your information for as long as We are either required to by law or as is relevant for the purposes for which it was collected.</p>

                            <p>We identify and use Your IP address to help diagnose problems with Our server, and to administer Our Website. Your IP address is also used to help identify You and to gather broad demographic information.</p>

                            <p>We may occasionally ask You to complete optional online surveys. These surveys may ask You for contact information and demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level).

                            <p>Access to personal information will also be given to those persons authorized by Droom and third parties engaged by Droom for administrative activities. We further clarify that by using our Website and / or Services available on the Website, We may utilize/disclose the details shared by Our users, without prejudice to any of their rights, for commercial or non-commercial purpose which we in our sole discretion consider necessary for Our business purposes or otherwise. While We ensure to the best of our capability that such third parties also hold your information in strictest confidence, We do not have 100% control over them and, therefore, We cannot guarantee complete privacy.</p>

                            <p>Further, the comments and photographs of Our Users may be publicized as testimonials for promotion of the Website and/ or the Services. </p>

                            <p>We and Our affiliates will share / sell some or all Your personal information with another business entity should We (or Our assets) plan to merge with, or be acquired by that business entity, or re-organization, amalgamation, restructuring of business.
