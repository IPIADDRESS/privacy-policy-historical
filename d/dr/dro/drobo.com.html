			<img src="images/title_privacy.gif" alt="Privacy" width="437" height="31">
				<p>Our Privacy Policy (the "Policy") is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Site, products and services. This Policy will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and the needs of our customers and partners.</p>
		  		<p>The Policy applies with respect to information we collect from datarobotics.com or drobo.com and any other sites on the World Wide Web owned and/or operated by Data Robotics, but does not address our activities with respect to the Registered Customer accounts that we offer. This statement is part of our user agreement and is subject to all of its terms. Other Web sites (including those we link to) have their own practices.</p>
				<p>If you have any questions, comments, or requests regarding privacy, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@datarobotics.com">privacy@datarobotics.com</a></p>
				<p><strong>Collection of Information</strong></p>
				<p>We collect non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your IP address or most-recently-visited URL. However, we do not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us, such as by ordering online, filling out a form or survey, entering a contest or sweepstakes, registering your email address with us or emailing us. We may also collect personal information from you at other points on our site that state that personal information is being collected.
		  		</p><p>We do not wish to obtain personally identifiable information from children who are using our site unsupervised. Thus, we ask children to obtain the consent of their parent or guardian before providing us with any personally identifiable information.</p>
				<p><strong>Disclosure of Information</strong></p>
				<p>Unless we tell you otherwise, we do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to any third parties. However, we might share your personally identifiable information with Data Robotics business partners, including as part of e-commerce transactions, and we may sell and rent aggregated (non-personally identifiable) information about our users.</p>
				<p><strong>Use of Information</strong></p>
				<p>We use personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information for internal marketing purposes and for site administration. However, unless we tell you otherwise, we usually do not use personally identifiable information collected from the Web site to send unsolicited mailings to you. Of course, if applicable, we do use personally identifiable information to perform the services for which such data was collected (i.e., if you sign up for an email newsletter, we will send the email newsletter to the address you provide us).</p>
				<p><strong>Third Party Sites</strong></p>
				<p>The Policy only addresses our activities from our servers. We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Site nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as points to information on topics that may be useful to the user of our Site.</p>
		  		<p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Site to another Web site, the Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other Web site, including Web sites that have a link on our Site, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>
				<p><strong>Removal of Your Personally Identifiable Data</strong></p>
				<p>If you provide us with personally identifiable information to have us perform ongoing services to you, usually we will provide you with a way to remove such data. Unfortunately, to the extent that such information is also stored in other databases, we cannot always ensure that such corrections or deletions will reach the other databases. If you wish to have information that you provided to us online removed from our records, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@datarobotics.com">privacy@datarobotics.com</a>.</p>
				<p>We will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that your information is removed from our online records.</p>
				<p><strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Methods</strong></p>
				<p>When you view our website or advertisements, we might store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our site, to help you navigate a website as easily as possible. Cookies can help us provide information that is targeted to your interests and they allow us to better understand how users use our site, which in turn helps us focus our resources on features that are most popular with our users. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site, including that portion which is targeted for our Registered Customers, may not work properly in that case.</p>
				<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
				<p>We use industry-standard methods to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access. Among other techniques, we usually store such information on a computer behind our "firewall" in a secure location, and we often restrict the number of employees internally who can access such data. Of course, there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet.</p>
