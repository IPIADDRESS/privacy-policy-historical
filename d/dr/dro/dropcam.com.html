<h1>Dropcam Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Last modified on 14 August 2009</h2>
<hr>

<p>Recent updates to this Privacy Policy may be found
<a href="#updates">here</a>.</p>
<p>Welcome to Dropcam, the application, website, and online services of
88Volts, Inc. ("Dropcam," "we," or "us").  Dropcam values the privacy of its
users who have Member accounts ("you" or "Users").  Dropcam knows that you care
how information about you is used and shared.  This Privacy Policy explains
what information of yours will be collected by Dropcam when you use the Dropcam
Service, how the information will be used, and how you can control the
collection, correction and/or deletion of information.  We will not use or
share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means
(including offline) or from other sources.  Capitalized terms that are not
defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in our
<a href="/about/tos">Terms of Use Agreement</a>.</p>
<p>By using the Service, you expressly consent to the information-handling
practices described in this Privacy Policy.  Your use of the Service and any
personal information you provide through the Service are subject at all times
to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement.</p>

<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>User-Provided Information:  You provide us information about yourself (such
as your name and e-mail address) if you register for a Member account with the
Service, or as you use the features and functionality of the Service, including
by uploading User Content.  If you correspond with us by email, we may retain
the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses.  We
may also retain any messages you send through the Service.</p>
<p>Cookies Information:  When you visit the Service, we may send one or more
cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to
your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and allows Dropcam to help
you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.  A cookie may
also convey anonymous information about how you browse the Service to us.  A
cookie does not collect personal information about you.  Dropcam uses both
session cookies and persistent cookies.  A persistent cookie remains on your
hard drive after you close your browser.  Persistent cookies may be used by
your browser on subsequent visits to the site.  Persistent cookies can be
removed by following your web browser's directions; please check your web
browser's Help Settings to learn how you can modify your cookie settings.  A
session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.  You
can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie
is being sent.  However, some features of the Service may not function properly
if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
<p>Log File Information:  Log file information is automatically reported by
your browser each time you access a web page.  When you register with or view
our site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web
browser sends whenever you visit any website.  These server logs may include
information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser
type, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing
pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>
<p>Clear Gifs Information:  When you use the Service, we may employ clear
gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage
patterns of our Users anonymously.  No personally identifiable information
from your Member account is collected using these clear gifs.  In addition, we
may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our Users to track which
emails are opened by recipients.  The information is used to enable more
accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make
Dropcam better for our Users.</p>

<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
<p>We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide
to you the features and functionality of the Service.</p>
<p>By providing Dropcam your email address you consent to our using the email
address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by
law, in lieu of communication by postal mail.  You also agree that we may send
you notifications of activity on the Service to the email address you give us.
We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as
newsletters, changes to features of the Service, or special offers.  If you do
not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your
preferences in your "My Account" page.  Opting out may prevent you from
receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.  You may
not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for
posting to the Service (including your User Content) becomes available to
Dropcam and any other Members authorized by you to share the information or
content.  If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may
remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users
have copied or saved that information.</p>
<p>Following termination or deactivation of your Member account, Dropcam may
retain your profile information and User Content for a commercially reasonable
time for backup, archival, or audit purposes.  Furthermore, Dropcam may retain
and continue to use indefinitely all information (including User Content)
contained in your communications to other Users or in your postings to public
areas of the Service after termination or deactivation of your Member
account.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to the
Service, we will ask you for that person's email address and automatically
send an email invitation.  Dropcam stores this information to send this email,
to register your friend if your invitation is accepted, and to track the
success of our invitation service.  Your friend may contact us to request that
we remove this information from our database at
<a href="mailto:privacy@dropcam.com">privacy@dropcam.com</a>.</p>
<p>Dropcam may use certain information about you and/or your User Content
without identifying you as an individual to third parties.  We do this for
purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or
technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content.</p>
<p>Dropcam reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the User
Content you post on the Service.  We reserve the right to remove any such
information or material for any reason or no reason, including without
limitation if in our sole opinion such information or material violates, or may
violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Use Agreement, or to protect or
defend our rights or property or those of any third party.  Dropcam also
reserves the right to remove information upon the request of any third
party.</p>
<p>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to:
</p><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
  <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">remember information so that you will
not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the
site;</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">provide custom, personalized content
and information;</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">monitor the effectiveness of our
Service;</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">monitor aggregate metrics such as
total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns;</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">diagnose or fix technology problems
reported by our Users or engineers that are associated with certain IP
addresses;</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">help you efficiently access your
information after you sign in;</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">operate, maintain, enhance, and
provide all of the features and services found on the Service;</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">track User Content and Users to the
extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act; and</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">automatically update the Dropcam
application on your system, cameras, and related devices.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<h3>How We Share Your Information</h3>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information:  Dropcam will not rent or sell your
personally identifiable information to others.  Dropcam may share your
personally identifiable information with third parties solely for the purpose
of providing the Service to you.  If we do this, such third parties' use of
your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy.  We may store personal
information in locations outside the direct control of Dropcam (for instance,
on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>
<p>We will Share your Video Content with other Members as directed by you via
the functionality of the Service.</p>
<p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings.
Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred
business assets in these types of transactions.  We may also transfer or assign
such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or
dissolution.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or
activities ("Events") on the Service together with a third-party partner.  If
you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use
it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve.  We cannot
control third parties' use of your information.  If you do not want your
information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not
to participate in these Events.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Dropcam will not
disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by
law or subpoena, or if we believe that such action is necessary to:
</p><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
  <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">conform to the law, comply with
legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take
action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities;</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">to enforce our
<a href="/about/tos">Terms of Use Agreement</a>,
take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against
any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement
agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">to exercise or protect the rights,
property, or personal safety of Dropcam, our Users or others.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:  We may share non-personally
identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages
and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties
to help them understand the usage patterns for certain Dropcam services.</p>
<p>Dropcam may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve
advertisements on the Service.  These third-party ad servers or ad networks use
technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that
appear on Dropcam.  They automatically receive your IP address when this
happens.  They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript,
or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to
personalize the advertising content.  Dropcam does not provide any personally
identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without
your consent.  However, please note that if an advertiser asks Dropcam to show
an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement,
the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the
audience they are trying to reach.  Dropcam's Privacy Policy does not apply to,
and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers.  Please
consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more
information.</p>

<h3>How We Protect Your Information</h3>
<p>Dropcam uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical
safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information
and User Content.  We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any
information you transmit to Dropcam, and you do so at your own risk.  Once we
receive your transmission of information, Dropcam makes commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure the security of our systems.  However, please note that this
is not a guarantee that such information or User Content may not be accessed,
disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical,
or managerial safeguards.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as
requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you
access to your account.  You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of
your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to
your email communications from Dropcam, at all times.</p>

<h3>Compromise of Personal Information</h3>
<p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a
breach of security, Dropcam will promptly notify those persons whose personal
information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification
procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by
applicable law.</p>

<h3>Your Choices About Your Information</h3>
<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information
through the Service, in which case Dropcam may not be able to provide certain
services to you.  You may update or correct your account information and email
preferences at any time by logging in to your account.  You can review and
correct the information about you that Dropcam keeps on file by contacting us
directly at <a href="mailto:privacy@dropcam.com">privacy@dropcam.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.  For that
reason, Dropcam does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from
anyone under the age of thirteen (13) or knowingly allow such persons to
register as Members.  If you are under thirteen (13) years of age, please do
not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address,
telephone number, or email address.  No one under age thirteen (13) is allowed
to provide any personal information to or on Dropcam.  In the event that we
learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age
thirteen (13) without verification of parental consent, we will delete
that information as promptly as reasonably possible.  If you believe that we
might have any information from or about a child under thirteen (13) years of
age, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@dropcam.com">privacy@dropcam.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Links to Other Web Sites</h3>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or
from our website, nor the information or content contained therein.  Please
remember that when you use a link to go from our website to another website,
our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.  Your browsing and interaction on
any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject
to that website's own rules and policies.  Please read over those rules and
policies before proceeding.</p>

<h3>Notification Procedures</h3>
<p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are
required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you
via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting
of such notice on our website, as determined by Dropcam in its sole discretion.
We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications
to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as
described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes
on our website to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it
and under what circumstances we may disclose it.  Changes to this Privacy
Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.  Please revisit this
page to stay aware of any changes.</p>
