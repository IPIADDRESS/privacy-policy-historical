  we take to respect your privacy concerns. </strong></p>

  on our secure and private Alumni Information Form or request a reply using one 
  of our feedback or reply forms, we will not know your name, your e-mail address, 
  or any other information that identifies you. <br>
  Internet Protocol (IP) Address:<br>
  An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer every 
  time you browse the Internet. When you request a page from our site, our server 
  logs your current IP address. We would only use your IP address to help diagnose 
  problems that affect the integrity of our computer systems, not for personal

  <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
  Holistic does not send or set cookies on your machine.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Information Needed to Execute the Transaction You Request:</strong><br>
  When we need to collect information from you, we will ask you to voluntarily 
  supply us with the information we need. For example, if you would like to receive 
  information about admission to Holistic, you may fill out the Inquiry Form in 
  the Admissions section which requests information about your name, address, 
  phone number and e-mail address plus a place to check programs you wish to receive 
  information about and a place to write your question, plus questions about how 
  you heard about us (for evaluation of our own marketing practices). We will 
  use your e-mail address only to provide the information you requested, or to 
  communicate news as you requested. If at any time you decide you do not want 
  to receive this information, you may let us know by reply e-mail or use the 
  form to request that we no longer contact you. Providing information to us using 
  any of our on-line forms is voluntary and the information we collect is used 
  only for the purpose for which the information was collected and is not shared 
  with any other companies. </p>
<p><strong><br>
  Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information:</strong><br>
  When we ask you for personal data in any of our forms on-line information is 
  transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) line provided you are using an 
  SSL enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. 
  This ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. 
  This secure mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted from 
  your computer. After information reaches Holistic it is stored on a secure server 
  that resides behind a firewall that is designed to block access from outside 
  the Center.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Holistic Use of Information:</strong><br>
  We treat the information that you provide to us as confidential information. 
  It is, accordingly, subject to Holistics security procedures and strict corporate 
  policies regarding protection and use of information. We will only disclose 
  this information to individuals at Holistic on a need-to-know basis and person(s) 
  authorized by you. Patient information is additionally protected under the Code 
  of Federal Regulations, Title 42 and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
  Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Holistic maintains strict compliance with each of these 
  laws and regulations.</p>
<p> The laws applicable to personal information vary from country to country. 
  The information we process and store is kept in accordance with the applicable 
  United States legal requirements, which may not be as comprehensive as the data 
  protection laws found in other countries, such as those in the European Union. 
</p>
<p> <strong>E-Mails and Opt-Out:</strong><br>
  Our goal is to only send e-mails that are likely to be of interest to you. All 
  e-mail is generated from Holistic and not from an outside third-party e-mail 
  service provider. Holistic does not make e-mail addresses available to any partners 
  in the Holistic Network or to any others for their use. You may at any time 
  request not to receive e-mails from Holistic by replying to any e-mail with 
  your request to opt-out.</p>
<p> <strong>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties:</strong><br>
  Holistic prohibits the sale or transfer of personal information to anyone outside 
  the Holistic imeediate internal network.</p>
<p> <strong>Links to Other Sites:</strong><br>
  Other sites linked to by the Holistic website are offered for your convenience 
  only. Holistic is not responsible for the privacy policies of those sites, or 
  for cookies those sites might use.</p>
<p> <strong>Legal Issues:</strong><br>
  This is a United States website and subject to United States law. Holistic will 
  disclose personal health information without your permission only when required 
  by law, or in a good faith belief that such action is necessary to investigate 
  or protect against harmful activities to Holistic patients, staff, volunteers, 
  alumni, property (including this site) or to others or as authorized by federal 
  medical privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
  Act. </p>
<p> <strong>Holistic Privacy Statement Changes:</strong><br>
  In the future, we may need to change the privacy statement for www.drugrehabcenter.com. 
  All changes will be made here so that you will always know what information 
  we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it 
  to anyone. Any changes made in the future will only apply to information collected 
  after any new policy is established. </p>
