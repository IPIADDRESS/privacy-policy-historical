        <a id="1"><strong><span style="padding-top: 85px; margin-top: -85px;">1.	Information That We Collect Through the Site</span></strong></a>

        <br><br>
        (a)	Information That You Provide
        <br><br>
        Drury may ask you to provide “Personal Information” (i.e., information that identifies you as a specific, identifiable individual) when you visit our Site. Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, business or personal mailing address, telephone number and email address.
        <br><br>
        You will need to provide us with Personal Information to make a room reservation, buy a gift certificate, or create a personal profile through our Drury Gold Key® Club. A personal profile makes it more convenient for you to make future reservations by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter Personal Information and makes it easier for us to inform you about products and special offers that may be of interest to you. In addition, if you elect, you can include credit or debit card information in your profile. Your credit or debit card information can be used for subsequent reservations to increase reservation speed and eliminate the need for you to repeatedly enter your credit card information.
        <br><br>
        We may also collect other information about you, such as demographic information (for example, your age or gender), and information about your preferences and interests (such as if you prefer a non-smoking room). We may collect payment information (such as a credit or debit card number), if applicable. If we combine non-Personal Information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.
        <br><br>
        Drury may ask you to provide Personal Information about others. For example, you may purchase a gift certificate or make a reservation for someone else, or we may allow you to forward information about our products, services, and properties to another person. When you provide us with such information, you represent that you have gotten any necessary consent of the other person before disclosing their information to us, which we will use in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
        <br><br>
        <a id="1b">(b)	Information We Collect Automatically As You Access and Use the Site</a>
        <br><br>
        In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to the Site, we and our third-party service providers (including any third-party content, advertising, and analytics providers) may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect certain information about your use of the Site whenever you visit or interact with the Site (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to our Site, the search terms you entered into a search engine that led you to our Site, all of the areas within our Site that you visit, and the time of day you visit the Site, among other information. Usage Information also includes the IP address, mobile device identifier, or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for any computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access the Site. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your device and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier.
        <br><br>
        We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including enhancing or otherwise improving the Site and our products and services. The Usage Information we collect is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we will treat it as Personal Information.
        <br><br>
        The methods used to collect Usage Information may include the following:
        <br><br>
        <a id="1b-c">Cookies and Local Storage.</a> Cookies and local storage are data files placed within a browser on your device when the device is used to visit the Site. These technologies are able to store a unique identifier for your device that can be used to recognize your device whenever you visit the Site and may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, to evaluate and improve the functionality of our Site, to help us deliver content specific to your interests, to process your reservations or requests and/or to analyze your visiting patterns. If you do not want to accept cookies, you can block them by adjusting the settings on your Internet browser. If you choose to disable cookies on your device, you will not be able to use all of the features of our Site, including the features associated with creating a user profile or making an online reservation. You can find more information about cookies and how they work at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.
        <br><br>
        Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “pixel tags,” “1x1 GIFs,” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and email messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular links were actually viewed.
        <br><br>
        Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
        <br><br>
        In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.
        <br><br>
        (c)	Information Third Parties Provide About You
        <br><br>
        We may receive information about you from third parties, including without limitation airlines, travel agents and companies (for example, booking.com and expedia.com) and event planners. In addition, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records in order to provide you with information, services, or products you have requested, to tailor content, to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may interest you, and for other purposes. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.

Like many websites and online services, Drury does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser.

        <br><br>
        We may share non-Personal Information, such as Usage Information and aggregated user statistics, with third parties in our discretion. We do not share Personal Information with third parties for those third parties’ marketing purposes unless we first provide you with either the opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of such sharing.  We may share the information we have collected about you (including Personal Information): (i) as disclosed at the time you provide your information, (ii) with your consent, (iii) as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, or (iv) in any of the following circumstances:
        <br><br>
        (a)	Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf
        <br><br>
        We may use third-party service providers to perform certain services on behalf of the Site, such as hosting the Site or Site features, providing website usage analytics, sending email or other communications, providing marketing assistance and data analysis, providing customer service, processing transactions, or performing other administrative services. We may provide these service providers with access to your Personal Information so that they can carry out the services they are performing for you or for Drury.
        <br><br>
        (b)	The Drury Gold Key® Club Credit Card
        <br><br>
        Drury may share your personal information and other information about you with Commerce Bank for purposes related to our cobranded Drury Gold Key® Club Credit Card.  For example, we may share information in order to send joint offerings, including information on how to apply for the Drury Gold Key® Club Credit Card, and in connection with your use of a Drury Gold Key® Club Credit Card, such as to maintain or service accounts and to effectuate transactions.
        <br><br>
        (c)	When You Agree to Receive Information from Third Parties or Request That We Share Your Information
        <br><br>
        You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from one or more third parties. If you agree at that time to have your Personal Information shared (by opting in or choosing not to opt out at that time), your Personal Information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party., If you later decide that you no longer want to receive communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties.
        <br><br>
        (d)	Administrative and Legal Reasons
        <br><br>
        We reserve the right to disclose any information (including Personal Information) if we believe such action is necessary: (i) to conform to legal requirements or to comply with legal process or a subpoena, or at the request of a governmental entity conducting an investigation; (ii) to protect and defend the legal rights or property of Drury, our Site or its users, or any other party; (iii) if we in good faith believe that such action is permitted by law; or (iv) in an emergency, to protect the health and safety of our users or the general public.
        <br><br>
        (e)	Business Transfers &amp; Transitions
        <br><br>
        Drury may share your information, including Personal Information, with its parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates, primarily for business and operational purposes. In the event Drury goes through a business transition (such as a merger, acquisition by another company, bankruptcy or sale of all or a portion of its assets, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process), your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. By providing your Personal Information, you agree that we may transfer such information to the acquiring entity without your further consent.
        <br><br>
        (f)	Sweepstakes, Contests, &amp; Promotions
        <br><br>
        We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a “Promotion”) that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the provisions, conditions or official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you (including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing materials). If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules (such as on a winners list).
        <br><br>
        (g)	Administration of the Drury Gold Key® Club Program Points System
        <br><br>
        If you choose to participate in Drury Gold Key® Club program points system, we may share your information with third parties in order for you to redeem your points or for us to otherwise administer the program’s points system.
        <br><br>
        (h)	Employment Applications
        <br><br>
        If you apply for a job through the Site, Drury or its service provider may ask you to provide self-identifying information (such as veteran status, gender, and ethnicity) in conjunction with laws and regulations enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) and other federal, state and local regulatory agencies. Providing such self-identifying information is voluntary, but if you do provide such information, Drury or its service provider may submit that information to the appropriate government or regulatory agencies to fulfill reporting requirements and use that information to defend against employment-related complaints.

        <a id="5"><span style="padding-top: 85px; margin-top: -85px;"><strong>5.	Third-Party Analytics Providers, Ad Servers, and Similar Third Parties</strong></span></a>
        <br><br>
        Drury works with network advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers, and other vendors to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Site (including pages viewed and the actions taken when visiting the Site), to serve our advertisements elsewhere online, and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Site and the effectiveness of our advertisements. Our service providers may collect certain information about your visits to and activity on the Site and other websites and services and may use this information to target advertising to you.
        <br><br>
        These service providers may set and access their own tracking technologies on your device (<a href="#1b-c">including cookies and local storage</a>) and may otherwise collect or have access to information about you. Some of these parties may collect Personal Information over time when you visit the Site or other online websites and services. Cookies, including those set by third-party network advertisers, may be used to (among other things): target advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, and conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may share Usage Information about visitors with third-party advertising companies, analytics providers, and other vendors for similar purposes.
        <br><br>
        For example, we use Google Analytics to collect data about traffic to our Site, to deliver advertisements when you visit other websites, and to share data about traffic to our website with Google and other Google Analytics program participants.  Additional information about how Google Analytics collects and shares data when you visit this website is available at <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html</a>. You can opt-out of Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.
        <br><br>
        Although we may use a variety of service providers to perform advertising services, some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You may want to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members. You may also want to visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and offers an “opt-out” by participating companies in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program.
        <br><br>
        If you are accessing the Site through an application (i.e., mobile phone or tablet) you can download the AppChoices application from your device’s application store (i.e., Google Play, Apple App Store, and Amazon Store). This DAA application allows participating companies to offer an opt-out of customized advertisements that are based on predictions about your interests generated from your application usage. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices">http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a>.
        <br><br>
        Please note that these companies may still collect information from you and opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to be served generic ads while online or on your device.
        <br><br>
        <a id="6"><span style="padding-top: 85px; margin-top: -85px;"><strong>6.	Protection of Personal Information by Drury</strong></span></a>
        <br><br>
        We employ commercially reasonable security methods and technologies to help secure your Personal Information. However, no system can be guaranteed 100% secure. We therefore cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, or that we transmit to you, or guarantee that it will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. You use the Site and provide us with information at your own initiative and risk.
        <br><br>

Also, it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases, and residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons.
        <br><br>
        Users who receive our newsletter and other marketing emails and who wish to remove themselves from that mailing list (i.e., opt out) can do so by following the link provided in an email received. You may also be able to change your preferences within the “My Account” portion of the Site. However, please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your use of our Site, service announcements, notices of changes to this Privacy Policy or other Site policies, or similar administrative or transactional messages. These transactional account messages may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from marketing communications.
        <br><br>
        <a id="8"><span style="padding-top: 85px; margin-top: -85px;"><strong>8.	Third-Party Links &amp; Content</strong></span></a>
        <br><br>
        The Site may contain links to other websites that Drury does not control, and the Site may contain advertising and other content hosted and served by third parties. Drury is not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party.
        <br><br>
        <a id="9"><span style="padding-top: 85px; margin-top: -85px;"><strong>9.	Users Residing Outside of the United States and Consent to Transfer</strong></span></a>
        <br><br>
        The Site is operated in the United States. If you are located in another jurisdiction, please be aware that information you provide to us will be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using the Site or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer, processing, and storage of your information in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside or are a citizen.
        <br><br>
        <a id="10"><span style="padding-top: 85px; margin-top: -85px;"><strong>10.	Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></span></a>
        <br><br>
        Drury reserves the right to change or modify this Privacy Policy in its discretion at any time and will notify you of material changes by posting the changed or modified Privacy Policy on our Site. We may also provide notice to you in other ways in our discretion, such as through contact information you have provided. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy unless otherwise specified and your continued use of the Site after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy (or such other act as specified in the revised Privacy Policy) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal Information was collected.
        <br><br>
        <a id="11"><span style="padding-top: 85px; margin-top: -85px;"><strong>11.	California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights</strong></span></a>
        <br><br>
        Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in California certain information relating to third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of Personal Information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as Drury does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing Personal Information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. As stated above in this Privacy Policy, Drury provides you with a choice prior to sharing your Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time Drury offers that choice, Drury does not share your information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes.
        <br><br>
        If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request by email to <a href="mailto:legal@druryhotels.com">legal@druryhotels.com</a> or write to us at: 721 Emerson Road, Suite 400, St. Louis, MO 63141 Attn: Legal Department. You must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field of your email or include it in your writing if you choose to write to us at the designated mailing address. You must include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per person each year.
