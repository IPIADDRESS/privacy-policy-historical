<h1>The Intermarkets privacy policy</h1>
Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting  the personal information you choose to share with us. We have adopted the  following privacy policy for the collection and use of all information  regarding Users and Subscribers, and their activities at our Publishers' Websites.  This policy tells you what information we may gather from you, how we may use  or disclose that information, and our efforts to protect it. In addition, our  advertising services may be delivered through our own domain located at: <a href="http://www.mercuras.com">www.mercuras.com</a>.&nbsp; Please read this policy carefully, and feel  free to contact us at info@intermarkets.net if you have any questions regarding  its contents.
<p> <span class="pgTitleBold">Information We May Gather<br>
      </span>Intermarkets may obtain the following types of non-personally  identifiable information from users and subscribers:</p>
                    <p><span class="pgTitleBold">Site Usage Data<br>
      </span>We collect non-identifiable information to measure how our Users and  Subscribers use our Publishers' Web sites. This information may include  statistics about the numbers and timing of unique visits to the Publishers'  site, repeat visits, and which pages are viewed.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><span class="pgTitleBold">IP Address Data<br>
      </span>We may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site,  track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate  use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable  information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><span class="pgTitleBold">Operating System and Web Browser Data<br>
      </span>Additionally, we may collect information pertaining to the type of  operating system and Web browser you are using and other non-personally  identifiable technical specification information to prevent the attempt to  deliver advertising that may not work on your computer.</p>
                    <p><span class="pgTitleBold">Use of Personal Information<br>
                      </span>Your registration, subscription, and any other data will be closely  protected.<br>
                      Intermarkets has no access to your subscription data. We may  provide our advertisers with non-identifiable, aggregated information about our  Publishers' Web site traffic.

                    <p><span class="pgTitleBold">Cookies<br>
                      </span>Intermarkets does not use “cookies,” which are small files that Web  sites send to your Internet browser for storage on your computer's hard drive.  However, in the course of serving advertisements to a Publisher's site our  third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your  browser.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      We use several third-party advertising companies to serve ads  when you visit our Publishers' Web sites. These companies may use information  (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about  your visits to the Publishers' sites and other Web sites in order to provide  advertisements on the Publishers' sites and other sites about goods and services  that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this  practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by  these companies, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">here.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><span class="pgTitleBold">Third Party Cookies</span><br>
  In the course of serving advertisements to the Publishers' sites, our third-party  advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.  Uses of the cookie may include:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Keeping track of how  many times we have served an advertiser’s banner to a particular user.</li>
                      <li>Keeping track of the  number of unique users that visit each of our&nbsp;websites. We provide this  information to advertisers so they may configure their ad campaigns  accordingly.</li>
                      <li>Keeping you from seeing  the same advertisement repeatedly.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><span class="pgTitleBold">Spyware or Adware<br>
      </span>These terms refer to applications that are downloaded to your  computer. These types of applications deliver ads (usually in the form of  pop-up type ads) based on your Web usage. We do not participate in any way with  spyware or adware applications, and we do not download these types (or any  types) of applications without your expressed acceptance. Cookies and .swf  files are not spyware or adware, and they are not harmful to your computer.</p>
                    <p><span class="pgTitleBold">What We Won't Do<br>
      </span>We do not engage in the collection, distribution, sale or use of  personally identifiable information about Web users, such as email address,  name, phone number and street address. We do not conduct individual web user  "profiling". We do not deliver or install "spyware" or any  other software on your computer to monitor your Web use.</p>
                    <p><span class="pgTitleBold">How Ads May Be Served<br>
      </span>When you visit one of the Publishers' Web sites, as the Publisher's  page is loaded on your computer, the Publisher's site may contact our domain at  www.mercuras.com or another third party ad server to deliver advertising on the  Web page you are viewing. That process may entail redirecting the request for  the ad to one or more additional, third party servers, and may include the use  of Java scripts. During the process of loading the ads, your computer may  connect to our servers to receive the advertising and/or to process the Java  script. At no time do our servers intrude on your computer to extract any  information other than the non-personally identifiable information described  above nor do we install any software of any kind on your  computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
                    <p><span class="pgTitleBold">Additional Information<br>
