	<p>If in the event that we sell our business, customer information may 
be one of the transferred business assets. If this happens, your 
information will still be subject to this policy.</p>

	<h2>Cookies and IP Addresses</h2>
	<p>When you visit one of our websites, we may send you a cookie. A 
cookie is a small file wich is placed on your computer or device.</p>
	
	<p>1. Essential Cookies</p>
	<p>These cookies are essential for the running of our websites. Without
 the use of these cookies parts of our websites would not function. For 
example The Times paywall uses cookies to help us identify which of our 
readers have a subscription in order to access paid for content held on 
the website.</p>
	<p>2. Analytical Performance Cookies</p>
	<p>We use these types of cookies to monitor our websites performance 
and how their users may use it. These cookies provide us with 
information that helps us provide better products to their users and 
also to identify any areas that may need maintenance. For example, we 
use performance cookies on The Sun's website to provide the most 
popular news articles further up the page of the website. </p>
	<p>3. Functional Cookies</p>
	<p>Functional cookies are used to remember your preferences on our 
websites. This can be anything from remembering your city in a weather 
forecast or saving your username.</p>
	<p>4. Behavioural Advertising Cookies/Third Party Cookies</p>
	<p>We, and our advertisers/sponsors, may use cookies to provide tailored advertising to you which we believe are relevant to you.</p>
	
	<p>Online behavioural advertising is a way of providing advertisements 
on the websites you visit and making them more relevant to your 
interests. This is done by grouping together shared interests based upon
 previous web browsing activity. Advertising is then displayed to you 
when you visit a website which matches these interests. </p>
	
	<p>Behavioural advertising is based upon your web browsing activity 
over a period of time - so it's different to advertising you may see 
when you're looking for something online using a search engine (eg 
Google) or on the website you may be visiting at a particular time.</p>
	
	<p>As an example, you may be doing research in order to buy a bicycle 
and read a number of different articles on a number of different 
websites. If a bicycle manufacturer was part of an advertising network, 
they may think that you are interested in buying a bicycle and serve you
 with one of their adverts for one of their bicycles. It is possible 
that from reading these articles elsewhere, you would see this advert on
 one of our or someone else's websites.</p>
	
	<p>We cannot control nor do we have access to any cookies placed on 
your computer by third party advertisers and sponsors. Audience Science,
 who generate these cookies have their own privacy policy at <a href="http://www.revenuescience.com/privacy.asp">http://www.revenuescience.com/privacy.asp</a> </p>
	
	<p>We may also track IP addresses. An IP Address is a number that can 
identify an Internet Service Provider and country location. It cannot 
provide personal information </p>
	
	<h2>How to control the use of cookies</h2>
	
	<p>You are not obliged to accept cookies and may modify your browser so
 that it will not accept cookies. The browser you use to surf the web 
not only allows you to see the cookies that you have got but also allows
 you to control their use. </p>
	
	<p>You can control them by allowing them, deleting them individually or
 deleting all of them. You can also set your browser to not accept 
cookies altogether. If this option is selected, you should be aware that
 many websites will not function properly or at all. It may be possible 
to set your browser to not accept cookies and ask for your consent 
before each cookie is set on your device. This gives you control over 
what is set on your device, however has the drawback of slowing down 
your browsing experience.</p>
	
	<p>There are different levels of control too. You are able to prevent 
just third party cookies being deployed, effectively opting out of 
behavioural advertising, and some even allow you to block specific 
companies you do not wish to deploy a cookie, instead of selecting all 
companies.</p>

	<h2>Web Beacons and URL tracking</h2>
	<p>As part of our email communications and website analyses, we may use web beacons and track URL's.</p>
	<p>Web beacons are electronic files that count users who access a 
website or page and can also allow us to see if a cookie has been 
activated. Web beacons on web pages or email communications allow us to 
see how successful an article may be or that an email message was 
successfully delivered and read.</p>
	<p>Tracked URLs will count the amount of clicks on a web page. This 
allows us to edit the site according to the popularity of the articles 
you read. </p>
	<p>You can't decline web beacons, however by preventing cookies being 
used on your computer, you can prevent web beacons from tracking your 
activity. For information about  managing your cookie options, please <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">click here.</a>
	</p><p>Please be aware that if you disable cookies, many services on 
our websites will not be available to you, particularly those that 
contain personalised content as outlined in the section <b>Personalised content</b>. </p> 

	<h2>Device Identifiers</h2>
	<p>Our Apps require access to the following services on your mobile 
device: UDID, MAC address, or other applicable device identifier. We 
send this information to our servers for the purpose of validating free 
trials. We do not share this information with any 3rd parties.</p>

	<h2>Personalised content</h2>
	<p>The content on our websites and in our email communications may be 
adjusted depending on what we know about the content, products and 
services that you like. This means we can highlight content and articles
 that we believe will be of interest to you.</p>
	<p>Advertising content may be adjusted depending on personal 
information. In some instances, this targeted advertising may be created
 by third parties and the information will be collected and held by 
these third parties outside the control of News International. </p>
	<p>We provide personalisation by using cookies, IP addresses, web 
beacons and URL tracking. A full explanation of how this works and how 
you can prevent the use of such activities, please see our <b>Cookies, and IP Address section</b>.</p> 


	<h2>Consent</h2>
	<p>By completing our registration forms with personal information or by the continued use of our services, you are consenting to:</p>
	<p>a) our processing your sensitive personal data such as health data for the above purposes; and</p>
	<p>b) the transfer and processing of your information in countries 
outside of the European Economic Area which may not provide the same 
level of data protection as the UK. If we do make such a transfer or if 
your personal information will be processed outside of the European 
Economic Area, we will put a contract in place to ensure your 
information is protected or where applicable covered by the US "Safe 
Harbor Program". </p>

	<h2>Marketing consent</h2>
	<p>If you are an existing customer we will keep you informed of product developments that relate to these products and services. </p>
	<p>When you give us your personal information, we will give you an 
option to receive additional ongoing marketing communications from us 
which may include offers and news of alternative products and services.</p>
	<p>We do not sell our customer data to other companies to use for their marketing purposes.</p>
	<p>All of our marketing communications will have a method to 
unsubscribe. You may also exercise your right to opt out of the use of 
your information for marketing purposes at any time by contacting us by 
one of the methods explained at the end of this notice.</p>
	<p>Please note: Many products or services include personalised 
communications as part of their package; users will be given the 
opportunity to control the receipt wherever possible. In the event that 
the product or service consists entirely of communication (e.g editorial
 bulletins) this may take the form of unsubscribing from the specific 
communication.</p>
	<p>If you purchase or redeem an offer with us, we may need to disclose 
your personal information to our partners, suppliers and 
subcontractors in order to process your order, fulfil deliveries, 
complete billing and invoicing transactions and to inform delivery and 
logistics planning. </p>
	<p>We may supply personal data to trusted suppliers for analysis 
purposes. This will be done under agreement with us and will be in line 
with this policy. </p>
	<p>We will work with other companies for promotional purposes where 
readers may be asked to opt in for future contact from that specific 
partner. With your permission we will transfer that customer data to the
 third party at which point it will fall under their own privacy and 
security controls. Members of the News International group of companies 
cannot be held liable for subsequent issues arising from third party 
usage of transferred data. </p>

	<h2>Disclosure</h2>
	<p>Your personal information will be disclosed where we are obliged or 
permitted by law to do so. If you post or send offensive or 
objectionable content anywhere on or to any of our websites or otherwise
 engage in any disruptive behaviour on any of our websites, we can use 
the information that is available to us about you to stop such 
behaviour. This may involve informing relevant third parties such as 
your employer and law enforcement agencies about the content and your 
behaviour.</p>

	<h2>Payment and credit checks</h2>
	<p>Customer data will be used to take payment for products and services
 and may be used to verify credit details related to this payment. 
Permission to do so is implicit in providing financial details to 
process payment. Direct Debit information may be retained for ease of 
renewal of services.</p>
	<p>If you apply for credit then to help us to make credit decisions 
about you, to prevent fraud, to check your identity and to prevent money
 laundering, we may search the files of credit reference agencies who 
will record any credit searches on your file. We may also disclose 
details of how you conduct your account to such agencies. The 
information will be used by other credit grantors for making credit 
decisions about you and the people with whom you are financially 
associated for fraud prevention, money laundering prevention and 
occasionally for tracing debtors.</p>

	<h2>Updating or deleting your personal information profile</h2>
	<p>When you register online with a News International group company, 
you can see, review and change your personal information by logging onto
 the website and going to "My Profile" or equivalent. Please ensure you 
update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Should 
you request that your account is closed and your personal information 
removed, please be assured that this will be done as soon as is 
reasonably possible. Personal information from closed accounts is 
retained in order to comply with legal obligations, prevent fraud, 
collect any fees owed or to resolve disputes.</p>
	<p>Personal, transactional and behavioural information will be stored 
against your personal profile. If you do not use your account or 
interact with us, then your profile will be held for three years and a 
further two years in an anonymised form for analysis purposes. It will 
then be securely deleted.</p>
	<p>When readers enter into a conversation with any of our titles, for 
example through the use of polls, comments, text messages, email, phone,
 radio or letters we reserve the right to display this content 
indefinitely in any relevant context subject to our editorial judgement.
 This will be anonymised in the case of testimonials or customer service
 conversations. </p>
	<p>Please remember that any information about yourself or your family 
that you submit in social media including chat rooms, blogs and forums 
will be viewed by other people. As such, this personal data may be 
viewed, collected and used by third parties over whom we have no 
control. We are not responsible for either the information you 
submit/post or otherwise make available in such public areas or any use 
that may be made of such information by any third party.</p>
	<p>When you give us information about another person, you confirm that 
they have appointed you to act for them, to consent to the processing of
 their personal data, including sensitive personal data and to the 
transfer of their information abroad and to receive on their behalf any 
data protection notices. </p>
	<p>When you request to have your profile removed from further marketing
 offers from us, you will be added to a suppression list to ensure your 
request is complied with. All personal data is processed in line with 
the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 and The Privacy and 
Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003.</p>

	<h2>Information Requests</h2>
	<p>You have a right to ask for a copy of your personal information from
 any News International group company which may hold about you (for 
which we charge a small processing fee) and to ask us to correct any 
inaccuracies in your personal information (which is free). To make sure 
we follow your instructions correctly and to improve our service to you 
through training of our staff, we may monitor or record telephone calls.</p>

	<h2>Notification of changes</h2>
	<p>From time to time, we may make changes to the Privacy Policy. This 
may be in relation to changes in the law, best practice, changes in our 
services or treatment of your personal information. We will always 
display clearly when the privacy policy was last amended on the website.
