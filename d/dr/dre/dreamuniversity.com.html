          <p><strong>We Value Your Privacy</strong> </p>
          <p> We value your privacy and understand that you are concerned about 
            privacy. We consider the information you choose to share with us 
            personal and confidential. Any information you provide us is held with 
            the utmost care, and is not used in ways you have not consented. A more 
            detailed explanation about how we safeguard your personal information is
            described below. Please contact us with any questions, comments or 
            suggestions about our privacy policy.</p>
          <p> <strong>Security</strong> </p>
          <p> We are committed to preventing others from unauthorized access to 
            the personal information you provide to us, and we maintain procedures 
            and technology designed for this purpose. We take several steps to 
            protect the information we have about you, including the following:</p>
          <ul type="disc" class="genericList">
            <li>We update and test our technology on a regular basis in order to 
              improve the protection of customer information.</li>
            <li>We require outside companies and independent contractors to whom we 
              provide customer information for marketing, servicing or processing 
              purposes to restrict the use of the information to those purposes and we
              prohibit independent use of such information.</li>
            <li>Access to your information is controlled by strict internal 
              procedures. We maintain policies about the proper physical security of 
              workplaces and records.<br>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong><br>
            Order Fulfillment</strong> </p>
          <p> As part of our normal order fulfillment process, we provide the 
            following information to our vendors who in turn provide that 
            information to the shipping provider.</p>
          <ul type="disc" class="genericList">
            <li>Ship to name</li>
            <li>Ship to address</li>
            <li>Ship to phone number</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong><br>
            Order Process</strong> </p>
          <p> During the order fulfillment process, we email you to update you on 
            the status of your order. These emails are typically related order 
            confirmation, shipping notification, delivery notification and shipment 
            delay notifications.</p>
          <p> <strong>Newsletters</strong> </p>
          <p> You can opt-in for our general newsletter and product notifications.</p>
          <p> <strong>Direct Mail</strong> </p>
          <p> When you supply us with your postal address or phone number online 
            you may receive periodic mailings or phone calls from us.</p>
          <p> <strong>Unsubscribe Policy</strong> </p>
          <p> We strive to only send e-mail to those who want to receive it. If 
            you would prefer not to receive future e-mails from us, reply to any 
            email with UNSUBSCRIBE as the subject.</p>
          <p> Note: You may not unsubscribe from order status emails. If you do 
            not wish to receive order status emails, please place your order via the
            telephone.</p>
          <p> <strong>The Information We Collect</strong> </p>
          <p> If you decide to register on our site, make a purchase request or 
            agree to participate in a promotion, we collect and store the following 
            types of information:</p>
          <ul type="disc" class="genericList">
            <li>Name</li>
            <li>Address</li>
            <li>E-mail address</li>
            <li>Telephone number</li>
            <li>Credit Card – We retain only a portion of the credit card number, 
              card type and expiration date. (For example: 1411XXXXXXXX1411)</li>
          </ul>
          <p><br>
            We need this information to fulfill your order. We may also use this 
            information to customize your experience using our website.</p>
          <p> If you order a gift to be sent directly to the recipient, we will 
            ask for the recipient's name, address and telephone number. Any order 
            status emails will be sent to you rather than the recipient. The 
            shipping carrier will need the recipient's phone number in case there 
            are difficulties delivering the order.</p>
          <p> <strong>Browser information collected on the web site</strong> </p>
          <p> We may gather general information about our website and visitors, 
            such as IP addresses, browsers, pages viewed, number of visitors, goods 
            and services purchased, etc., but in doing so we do not reference you by
            individual name, e-mail address, home address, or telephone number. We 
            use this data in the aggregate to determine how much our customers use 
            parts of our site so we can improve the customer experience on our site.
            We may provide this statistical information to third parties, but when 
            we do so we do not provide personally identifying information without 
            your permission.</p>
          <p> As part of our service, we use cookies to store and track 
            information about you on our website. A cookie is a small amount of data
            that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your 
            computer's hard drive. Generally, we use cookies to enhance your 
            experience on our site; remind us who you are and enable us to access 
            your account information so you do not have to re-enter it on subsequent
            visits; gather statistical information about usage by registered or 
            unregistered users, and research visiting patterns. We prefer you enable
            cookies on your computer. You will be able to place online orders with 
            us regardless of your whether cookies are enabled on your computer.</p>
          <p> <strong>The Way We Use Information</strong> </p>
          <p> Because our goal is to provide products that best meet your needs, 
            we evaluate your personal interactions with us in an effort to bring you
            the products which best suit your tastes. In addition, we use your 
            information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to 
            statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product 
            offerings and to customize our site's content, layout, and services.</p>
          <p> We may use your information to deliver information to you that, in 
            some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, new
            products, services and promotions. At times we may ask you to provide 
            us voluntarily with additional information regarding your personal or 
            business interests, experience or requests, which we may use to 
            customize our products and services for you.</p>
          <p> The email addresses that we collect are used by us to contact 
            consumers for marketing purposes and are not shared with other 
            organizations for commercial purposes unless you've requested to receive
            email offers from carefully selected marketing partners of Dream 
            University®.</p>
          <p> If you place a request for products or services, we use your 
            personal information to ship your order; if the products or services are
            from a retail partner, we may provide your relevant information to that
            retailer for purposes of the transaction. If you establish a credit 
            account with us or our providers, we collect additional information, 
            including billing information, credit card number and expiration date, 
            and tracking information from checks or money orders.</p>
          <p> We may also use or disclose information to resolve disputes or 
            investigate problems. We may disclose or access information whenever we 
            believe in good faith that the law so requires or if we otherwise 
            consider it necessary to do so to maintain service and improve our 
            products and services.</p>
          <p> We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our 
            servers, to manage our website and to enhance our site based on the 
            usage pattern data we receive.</p>
          <p> <strong>Children under 13</strong> </p>
          <p> We do not knowingly collect or use personal information from 
            children under 13 without obtaining verifiable consent from their 
            parents. We have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who 
            access our website, and so we carry out the same Privacy Policy for 
            individuals of all ages. If a child has provided us with personal 
            information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian
            should contact us to remove the information and opt out of promotional 
            opportunities.</p>
          <p> For more information about the Children's Online Privacy Protection 
            Act (COPPA), visit the FTC website: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">www.ftc.gov</a>.</p>
          <p> <strong>Marketing Partners</strong> </p>
          <p> The Privacy Policy of an advertiser or promotional service appearing
            at our site may differ from ours. We encourage you to read that policy 
            before responding to the offer. We are not responsible for the data 
            collection and use practices of nonaffiliated marketing partners to 
            which our web site may link.</p>
          <p> <strong>Changes to Our Policy</strong> </p>
          <p> The practices and policies contained in this disclosure are subject 
            to change. Any such changes will be communicated through our website. 
            The practices and policies in this disclosure replace all previous 
            notices or statements with respect to the same subject matter.</p>
          <p> <strong>Your Consent</strong> </p>
          <p> By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this 
            information in the manner we describe.</p>
          <p> <strong>How to Contact Us</strong> </p>
          <p> To update, correct or delete your personal information, please 
            contact us. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take
