He died of heart failure four days before St. Patrick's Day, a couple of months shy of his 79th birthday, and after a year of hospice care. He took his last breath quite peacefully while I sat by his bedside with my mother and Seamus, my parents' big, fluffy, orange and white cat. I was stunned by how clear it was that my father's spirit had left his body. Only his earthly container remained. A shell of him lay still and quiet and cool on the bed ... but he was gone. And so was a family history I'd neglected to plumb.   Some people seem to be supernaturally connected to loved ones who've gone on to the great beyond. Not so for me. Oh, I can imagine what my father might say or think about something, what movies he'd like to see, or what books he'd be reading if he were still here. And I've wondered how much he might know about our earthly lives here without him. There are things I hope he doesn't know and others I wish he did.   I wish he could have seen my daughter play point guard on her AAU basketball team and hear her play the guitar and sing songs she's written herself. I wish he -- a Fordham man -- had seen my son graduate from another fine Jesuit institution ... and I wish he'd seen that same grandson get married last year. I wish he'd lived to see the election of an African-American president...   But had he lived even six more months, he'd have been heartbroken by 9/11, not only because he was a pacifist, but because he was a native New Yorker, born and bred on the island of Manhattan.   I'm glad he didn't see the towers fall and I wonder if it's true what the book of Revelation says about heaven ... Will God wipe every tear from their eyes? Will there really be no more death or mourning or crying or pain...? I rationalize that if heaven is all it's cracked up to be, with everyone eternally happy, then my father has not been aware of things that might cause him grief -- not terrorist attacks, his daughter's missteps, a grandchild's illness, or my mother's debilitation from dementia.   What I wonder about more than any of this, though, is why I didn't query my father about his younger self when I had the opportunity. I was a reporter, trained to ask questions ... yet I didn't.   It's possible that that my father constructed unspoken and invisible barriers around his own family-of-origin issues, and that on some deep, mystic level I was discouraged from going there. But it's also true that I was wrapped up in childrearing and marriage and work and church committees and friends. I hadn't yet developed an interest in the past beyond my own girlhood experiences.   But now, I crave knowledge of earlier generations, and the dribs and drabs I've unearthed through census returns, ships' manifests and other public records are like crack. I get a hit; I want more.  There are revelations...  My grandfather eloped, leaving Northern Ireland for New York City in 1905. He'd lost his first wife and three children -- two infants and a 14-year-old son -- by the time my dad came along, his fourth and youngest child with wife number two.   And there are dead ends...  I've yet to find evidence of my grandfather beyond 1942 when he filed a WWII draft registration card. He was 55-years-old and working for the Otis Elevator Co.   I don't know how he died or when ... And there's nobody left to ask.   My dad told a lot of stories, but precious few about his childhood. I know he once stole a Charlotte Russe from the neighborhood bakery, running home lightning fast to avoid being caught ... that on wash days his mother made rice pudding ... and that he once hid under the kitchen table to avoid a whipping from his father -- my only memory of my dad ever mentioning his own.   So, Dad, I have a few questions...  How bad was it? Was your father an angry drunk? Is that why you never spoke of him? Was he bitter with grief from losing a wife and three children? How often was he out of work? What did he tell you of his own father? Or of his childhood in County Tyrone? How did he treat your mother? How did they meet? How and when did your father die and where is he buried? Did you have a favorite childhood meal? Or were you simply lucky for anything on the days there was enough to eat? Why did you enter the monastery at a time when others were joining the service? Did your mother pressure you into it? And how did she feel when you left religious life after 16 years? Why did you and Mom move so far away from your families?   There are years worth of questions. You might want to start asking them, even if you think you're not interested, because one day, it's likely you will find yourself trying to fill in the blanks to gain a greater understanding of those who came before. And if you wait too long like I did, it'll be too late.   So, if your parents -- or grandparents, aunt and uncles -- are still alive and compos mentis, and you haven't already done so, consider asking the questions. The secrets, stories and experiences carried from one generation to the next give us historical and personal context that goes far beyond why we have blue eyes or red hair or the Kelleher nose.  And while we're at it, we might begin to ponder the stories we want to tell to our children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews. Because ancestry.com is great ... but it's no substitute for a tale told with your uncle's impish grin, your grandmother's brogue, or a tear in your father's eye.

On Father's Day, here are some glimpses of Obama just being a dad.    He's really proud of his daughters        Despite living in the White House, Obama says that his two daughters, Malia, 16, and Sasha, 14, are actually pretty normal.   &quot;The truth is the girls are wonderful,&quot; Obama told &quot;Extra,&quot; earlier this month. &quot;You know they work hard, they work a lot harder than I ever did when I was a kid.&quot;  &quot;Most importantly, they're kind, they're respectful, they don't have an attitude,&quot; he said. &quot;Partly because maybe my mother-in-law was here, you know we say we don't want to see any attitude out of them. And they've been terrific.&quot;   He wants his daughters to make as much as their male counterparts   As president, Obama has backed legislation to get equal pay for women and has framed the issue as a personal one for him.  “Why would I want my spouse or my daughter discriminated against? That doesn’t make any sense,” he said in April.   He's got pretty good dating advice    Obama often jokes about the Secret Service detail that he has following his daughters around, but when it comes to dating, he has said that he wants to be hands off.   &quot;What I've told them before is, as long as that young man is showing you respect, and is kind to you, then I'm not going to be hovering over every second,&quot; he told television host Steve Harvey in 2013.     Obama also said that it was &quot;a little bit jarring&quot;  to see Malia in heels for the first time when she attended her first prom last year.    He helped coach Sasha's basketball team to a championship         In 2012, Obama said that he helped the head coach of Sasha's basketball team run through practice drills on their way to winning a tournament championship. Obama also once filled in coaching for the team on short notice.    His daughters still think he is embarrassing      Obama told Extra earlier this month that Sasha and Malia still are embarrassed by him. Some of that may have been on display at the annual Turkey pardon in 2014 when he asked them if they wanted to pet the turkeys and Malia simply said “no.”     He knows how to flaunt dad jeans        Enough said. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

He's never served himself first at the table, or wasted a single morsel of food on his plate. (As he'll turn 90 on his next birthday, this makes for quite a stack of plates.)   He's never complained about the long hours he worked to support his family.   He's never been a churchgoer, preferring to contemplate this nutty thing called life while out in the sunshine, clipping his hedges.   He's never rooted for a sports team, cheered for any politician or been dazzled by things other people possess.   He's never ordered a la carte, driven anywhere when he could walk instead, or used a power tool when a manual tool could get the job done.   He's never gotten less than a month's use out of a can of tennis balls, never treated an open bar as a chance to get loaded, never said &quot;no&quot; to a neighbor in need.   He's never gone to bed without asking himself: &quot;What did I accomplish today?&quot;  Just one more &quot;never,&quot; my favorite of all - he never made me think anything I dreamed of doing was out of reach.  All these &quot;nevers&quot; translate to one &quot;always.&quot; Tony Carillo has always been there for his loved ones, having wasted none of his steam on the small stuff.   Happy Father's Day, Dad.

Despite the evolution of women's and men's social roles, the father-daughter bond - whether strong and nurturing or broken or non-existing - still holds an enormous sway over women. No matter how much their fathers may have disappointed or hurt them, all the women I met felt a measure of loyalty and gratitude to them, and expressed their eagerness to stay connected to the men who were among the first loves in their life. Fathers matter a great deal not only in childhood but well into adulthood--and yet few women are truly aware of the ways in which their fathers impact them. Below I draw from the research I conducted while writing my book to address the issues that people are most interested in about dads and daughters.  Lessons fathers are better able to teach their daughters than mothers.  More and more, fathers are treating their little girls like they might have treated sons in the past: teaching them to fish, taking them camping, familiarizing them with things like car parts and power tools, and encouraging them to pursue careers in male-dominated fields. And more and more women are making their way in the world of work, often modeling themselves more on their fathers than on their mothers, and looking to their fathers for guidance in their careers. Of course, moms can teach these things, too -- both the fishing and the career-mindedness -- but fathers seem to play a particularly critical role in the development and choices of their daughters in the world of work. The best lesson that a modern father can teach his daughter is that long-held assumptions about parental roles and responsibilities are changing, and that there is no such thing any more as &quot;the wife's job&quot; or &quot;the husband's job.&quot;  As daughters enter into adolescence their relationships with dads change.   Traditionally, fathers and daughters have struggled to regain the connection they shared when the girl was very young: the time of shoulder rides and tickle attacks. But fathers are learning to be role models for their daughters throughout adolescence and into adulthood. The relationship will change as girls enter the adolescent years when they begin to separate from their parents and align more closely with their friends. But the goal of the relationship should remain consistent. Fathers should aim to continue acting as caring supporters who have time and interest to talk -- even if the daughter isn't interested herself. Continuing to act as a role model at home and at work will help provide daughters with the blueprints they need to have healthy relationships with men later on in life, whether as bosses, business associates, or boyfriends/husbands.  Fathers' roles change and they need to adapt to daughters' changing needs. All parents need to adapt to adolescence! But the best tack is to practice consistency -- being present, engaging in conversation, and trying one's best to prevent the awkwardness of adolescence from impacting their own actions or attitudes. The way a father treats his daughter, and his wife, will help set the pattern for the behaviors a daughter finds acceptable (or not acceptable) in her own romantic partners. Especially during adolescence, when daughters begin to enter their own romantic relationships, this strong modeling behavior can be crucial. The bottom line for fathers: Set a good example in how you treat women. In most cases, this is how your daughter will expect to be treated.  There are things a father can do if he feels like he has really botched an interaction with his daughter.   Hearing a father say, &quot;I was wrong, and I am sorry&quot; goes a long way. Daughters are traditionally very forgiving when it comes to their fathers. But a father owning up to his mistake provides a great example of how to address mistakes with maturity while also showing daughters that she is respected as a young adult.  Ways fathers can build trust and connection with their daughters during adolescence.   Being present and remaining consistent is the best way to build trust. Showing an interest in her life, without forcing her to reciprocate and without taking it personally when she seems uninterested, is key. That may mean volunteering for opportunities at her school or it may just mean asking her to go for a walk to get ice cream after dinner. Don't use every opportunity to &quot;talk.&quot; Be sure to have some moments that are just natural, two people hanging out.  Cultural trends fathers should be concerned about and address with their daughters.   I think that the prevalence, and permanence, of social media is the most troubling trend impacting teens. Learning to use social media and the Internet responsibly is an important skill for teens; that means restricting or constant monitoring of their online activity isn't the answer. Dads should aim to keep the lines of dialogue open, talking to teens about the appropriate use of social media, letting them know about the dangers and possible consequences of misuse and, even, letting them make their own mistakes, because that's often the best way to learn what not to do.  Strategies fathers can use to start conversations with their adolescent daughters who may be closed off or uninterested in talking.  It's entirely normal -- desirable, even -- for teenagers to begin pulling away from their parents and start connecting more closely with their friends. The best approach for a dad looking to keep the connection tight is often a casual approach: You can't force her to talk, but you can make it known that you're available and willing to talk whenever she's ready. Ask questions and be prepared to listen to the answers. Be interested, but don't pry too much. Create opportunities for interaction, but don't put a lot of pressure on the outcome. Some days will be easier than others.  There are things fathers can do when mothers and daughters get in fights.   Mother-daughter conflicts can be a source of great tension for dads. In most cases, it's preferable for both parents to be on the same side; at the very least, a father should try not to disagree with his wife in front of the child. Instead approach the situation as mediator. Ask to hear both sides, and then repeat what he hears. He might try his best to get each person to see the other one's side, while remaining neutral himself. This will also model to a teenager the importance of listening, versus reacting and responding. Later, he might offer to listen to his daughter's side in a one-on-one conversation. His allegiance will be with his wife, ultimately -- even if the two don't agree, talking about that disagreement in opinion will have to happen outside of earshot of the teenager. But it's important that a daughter feels that she is being heard and that, if a father is &quot;choosing&quot; to side with his wife, his daughter has a clear understanding of why that is.  Specific advice for single fathers.   Both mothers and fathers play a key role in a child's development. That said, the new American family is hardly traditional anymore, and kids aren't necessarily suffering as a result. It's very possible to raise exceptional, morally grounded children no matter what your family looks like. The development of a child's character depends less on whether there is a male figure or a female figure or two parents at all. That said, single parents often have to work harder to provide their children with role models and resources to make up for the missing gender, and so single fathers can and should seek out female role models that can be present and consistent --and positive -- in a daughter's life, whether that's an aunt, a friend, or a grandmother. Many daughters without mothers present in the home will also seek out female role models on their own. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.
