Brandy and Susan considered a few schools before choosing one that would best fit their family. They even tried to hold themselves to finding a school that would have at least one other LGBT family so their children would have a classmate and family to be able to relate to. “At the end of the day, it’s not so super important. I think it depends on your comfortability level,” Brandy said when looking for schools with other two-mom or two-dad families. She added, “For us, as long as the teachers, and other parents, and the kids are familiar with your family, and you have made them comfortable with your family, it really doesn’t make any difference to children.” They also share how they helped the director of their school and the teachers learn more about their family. They provided the administration with information about their family such as what their kids called them as parents and some great children’s books that would reflect their family. Susan added that she’s very mellow and not into focusing that she’s in a lesbian or two-mom relationship, however, she adds that as a parent you have to make sure your kids are armed and comfortable: “If suddenly it’s Mother’s Day and you have two dads, you’re jacked.” She explains that it’s important to speak with teachers so that when situations like that arise, they have it in their head not to exclude your children or any other children who come from a diverse family. Brandy and Susan also encourage LGBT parents to volunteer at the school and be present for events so that other families, parents, and administrators get to know you and feel comfortable around your family and your children. If you work, Brandy and Susan have other suggestions for you such as setting up play dates or throwing a fun, relaxed event for the class at the park such as Brandy did before school started this year. Check out the video below to see Brandy and Susan explain their approach and give some tips on how to navigate picking a school and starting the discussions with teachers.&nbsp; Alex Temblador lives in Texas and is a writer for The Next Family and FemPotential.&nbsp; Also on The Next Family:&nbsp; Two Moms Talk About Second Parent Adoption Lesbian Moms Give Tips On Picking A Donor&nbsp; White House Discussion On Gender Stereotypes &nbsp; -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Even the rain is comforting--warm spring showers that smell like new growth and possibility. Both of my daughters were born in spring. I was born in spring.  But I'm balancing an impossible reality this year. My teenage daughter has terminal cancer. My brain wants to leap forward in remembered anticipation of hot summer days, but the green sprouts, the returning birds, the longer days...all of it seems diminished, almost sinister. Cancer has once again twisted the natural order of things, turning spring into something menacing and dark.  Spring makes the passage of time too obvious, providing visual proof of how fast the days come and go. I mark each new week by the way the trees keep changing, but this doesn't give me comfort like it once did, because it also means my daughter's cancer is growing.  I'm reminded, with heavy certainty, that this will likely be her last spring. That puts a special kind of pressure on every single moment--a pressure that might shatter me.  This year it got warm too quickly in March and my neighbor's Magnolia tree began to bloom, but then it snowed and the flowers died on the branch. That's where they've remained--dark shadows of dead flowers that never fully opened. Why this year? My daughter deserves to see the flowers open until the petals drift down, covering the grass like pink frosting.  I wish I could flip the years back to the days of driveway chalk and blowing bubbles, to when spring held the promise of a dozen seasons stretched endlessly in front of us - me and the girls. Cancer wasn't supposed to happen to my child.  I'm the person you don't want to be. I'm the worst case scenario.   The other day an old friend of mine called to tell me she'd gotten fired that morning. We shared a laugh when I suggested she'd called me because I'm the one person who can help her put losing her job into perspective. She'll have more time with her 12-year-old daughter, after all. She can always get another job.  I've lost faith in spring blossoms--given up on seasonal rituals and milestones--even though I long for them in a way that's almost physically painful. I see them played out on Facebook, at my children's schools, on television...everywhere. My daughter is supposed to get her driver's license. She is supposed to go to prom. She is supposed to graduate from high school.  My daughter is supposed to grow up.   I've lost faith in &quot;supposed to's&quot; because nothing about what's happening to my child, to my family, makes any sense. Life is supposed to make sense, right? My family is maintaining a nearly impossible balancing act of trying to live each day without looking too far ahead in the midst of a world that obsesses over the future. Have you ever tried doing that? It's really hard.  I spend weekdays gazing out my office window as the minutes tick by, trying to get my mind to focus on work, on getting things done. I visualize the seconds pouring out of each day, overflowing into minutes, then hours--time I'll never get back. We use time up like it will never run out, but it does run out, doesn't it? Even in spring.  Everything seems pointless when I'm sinking into the darkest part of my life. I know that daily tasks are a way to keep the boat from sinking faster, but most days I want to give in, watch the boat fill up. I want to go down to the bottom of the ocean with it.   When people ask how I'm doing, I usually say, &quot;Fine.&quot; But more often than not, I'll start crying because my brain carries me forward to the place of unthinkable thoughts. I know it shows in my eyes--especially to other parents--and I don't blame them for backing away. No one wants to look at this place with me.  It's a foreign place where my daughter's room is empty, except for things she filled it with, things I know I can't bear to move. Empty without her, full of her memories. How can something be both empty and full?  When your mind can't tune out thoughts of death, then death becomes a filter for everything you see and do. I can't focus on the fact that the Magnolia tree is sprouting tiny green leaves. I can only see the shadowy silhouettes of dead flowers that never got a chance to bloom.  My daughter looks healthy. She feels wonderful. She's gained 14 pounds in the last two months, weight she desperately needed after an intense surgery followed by three weeks of chemotherapy in February. She's been smiling a lot, coming out of her room to ask for an iced green tea--her new favorite drink--and thoroughly enjoying it when she drinks it. She's wiser than me, at 14, she knows what's important.  It's the final cruelty of a disease that's offered up a thousand cruelties--watching my daughter heal yet again, letting my thoughts carry me forward to a place of miracles that don't exist for her. It's also the final gift that she is healing, that she feels good. I don't have a resolution to this pain because I'm embedded in it. All I can do is share something from a friend of mine who lost her husband to cancer five years ago. She mourns his loss each day.  &quot;You cannot carry this all alone. You have to lean, and share this load...I keep you in my heart and prayers, and continually ask the Universe to bless and protect your darling girl...and give you all peace and comfort despite this cruel storm that rages around you.&quot; -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Breaking typical morning routine protocol, I called my 7-year-old, Ivy, up on the bed with me to watch what turned out to be videos from when my daughter first learned the word &quot;mine&quot; and where her nose was. We watched the videos of a giggling girl with a healthy dose of jokester attitude and it reminded me of how grateful I am to be a mother. Motherhood is one of the scariest roles I have ever taken on, and it was great to take a few minutes this morning to look back all of the thing I loved about being a new mom.   I didn't know I loved the sound of a crying baby...  the sweet, helpless, infant-specific wail of fear and unrest  what do you do to help to satisfy  what if there is nothing to do,  would I then too just cry?  a warm bottle, a snug swaddle, a gentle tune mostly off key  a bellow only a loving parent's cradle can peace  soothing to cooing -- gently adrift off to sleep  these numbered days the true beginning of a love  that will last a forever.   I didn't know I loved the smell of a fresh pack of diapers...  alongside scentless wipes for the most sensitive of skin  how changing, powdering, wiping, and cream  result in a bright and glistening eyed giggle of glee  how mundane mothering tasks begin the bond  the chores and the hardships nothing to the knowing look that  I am her savior, protector, provider,  and of me she is in awe.   I didn't know I loved puddles of drool...  from a deeply sleeping, softly breathing, slightly snoring babe  a sweating tight snuggle making the contented sticky puddle  snorting motorcycle hands, gentle tossing, and satisfied sighs  her healing sweetness and hypnotic breath's gentle fall and rise  ninja-like transfers to the crib, followed by a light whisper of a kiss  breathe in smile -- purely content.   Each day a new day, a new milestone, a new depth to love  every puddle, every diaper, and the countless tears, I didn't know I could love so many things I had feared...

Go out without your spouse and remember what it felt like to be single. The axiom is 100 percent true: Absence makes the heart grow fonder and often leads to spouses actually missing each other -- a hard feeling to recapture after years of being together, said Jenny Block, the author of Open: Love, Sex and Life in an Open Marriage.&nbsp; &quot;It's important to take some time to get back to being who you were before you got married,&quot; she said. &quot;Reconnect with friends. Dive back into the hobbies and pastimes you enjoyed. Do you. Not 'couple you' or 'married you.' Just you.&nbsp;In the process, you may be surprised at how much you're reminded of why you fell in love with each other in the first place.&quot;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;Talk to your spouse in public the same way you did on your first date. If you love your partner, be respectful of them in public, said&nbsp;Deb Besinger, a life and relationship coach based in Raleigh, North Carolina. Quite simply, don't become the loudmouth couple at dinner who has no problem berating each other between bites of salmon. (Really, no one wants to be that couple.) &quot;Never name call or dishonor your spouse in public,&quot; Besinger cautioned. &quot;This seems like a no-brainer but it's harder to do when you're annoyed with your spouse than you realize.&quot;&nbsp; 3. Don't expect your spouse to fulfill your every need.&nbsp; These days, we depend on our spouses to fulfill and satisfy us in every way -- and that expectation is terrible for marriages,&nbsp;said&nbsp;Greg Cason, a Los Angeles-based psychologist. &quot;Marriages today are folding under the weight of our own expectations: Why do we expect our spouses to be our best friend, dinner companion, dance partner, sexual playmate, money-earner, maid, cook, fix-it person, confidant, caretaker, soul mate, biggest fan, stalwart supporter, chauffeur, dog-walker and bestie,&nbsp;among other things?&quot; If you're struggling to cut your partner some slack, Cason suggests reciting this Marriage Serenity Prayer: &quot;Grant me the serenity to appreciate what my spouse does provide, the courage to accept the things my spouse does not provide and the wisdom to get those needs met elsewhere.&quot; 4. Find your own definition of monogamy. Today, many couples are exploring versions of monogamy tailored to their own needs.&nbsp;While an open marriage isn't for everyone, there are happily married people who've pursued flings and relationships outside their marriages with their spouse's permission, said Susan Pease Gadoua, a marriage therapist and the co-author of The New I Do, Reshaping Marriage for Skeptics, Realists and Rebel. &quot;When couples fall out of love or lust, they think the only 'right'&nbsp;option is to end it,&quot; she said.&nbsp;&quot;But some partners become monogamish (a term coined by Dan Savage): they give each other permission to go outside the marriage in order to get their sexual needs met.&quot;&nbsp; 5. Stop holding your spouse to an impossible standard.&nbsp; Your spouse is a flawed, imperfect person who acts out when they're&nbsp;hangry&nbsp;and will disappoint you time and time again.&nbsp;The same holds true for you. Don't set yourself up for failure by expecting each other to be soulmates who rarely fight and read each other's minds,&nbsp;Block said.&nbsp; &quot;Marriage is not about perfection: It's not about finding someone who completes you and makes you feel like a princess,&quot; she said.&nbsp;&quot;Marriage is about being perfectly imperfect for and with one another. It's about loving each other and the life you have built together because of all the delightful imperfections, not in spite of them.&quot;&nbsp; 6. Take a vacation from your marriage. It's not going to kill you to spend a weekend -- or a few weeks -- away from your spouse. In fact, it could benefit your marriage, especially if you're experiencing a rough patch, Cason said.&nbsp; &quot;Sometimes what you really need is a break,&quot; he said. &quot;Some couples schedule one weekend a year to take a real break from each other. Others, a week or so. If things are very bad, consider living separately for a few months. Work with a therapist to set up rules including how much contact to have with each other and what you're going to tell your mothers when they ask about it.&quot; 7. Recognize that you're not immune to infidelity.&nbsp; Anyone is susceptible to cheating. If you're in it for the long haul,&nbsp;it's almost inevitable that one or both of you may struggle to stay faithful, whether it's the temptation of an&nbsp;emotional affair&nbsp;or something more physical, Besinger said.&nbsp; &quot;While no one wakes up one morning and decides, 'this is the day I'm going to cheat on my spouse,' the perfect storm of circumstances, emotions and opportunity can cause an affair to happen for just about anyone.&quot;&nbsp; To stave off infidelity as much as possible,&nbsp;try having an open, honest discussion about it: What's missing from your relationship that might potentially cause you to cheat? How would you handle the fallout of an affair?&nbsp; &quot;Talk about it and become very intentional about preventing the opportunity,&quot; she said. &quot;Be honest with each other: if something unavoidable came up, how would we handle it and if we stayed together, what would our future look like?&quot; -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.
