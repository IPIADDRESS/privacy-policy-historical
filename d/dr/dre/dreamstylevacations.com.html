        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Important Read This</strong></p>
        <p align="justify" class="style23">This Privacy Policy describes the terms of our   commitment to your privacy.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>PERSONS OR PARTIES COVERED&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>This   Privacy Policy is intended to cover all visitors to this website, all   subscribers to lists or newsletters whether paid or unpaid, all members or   affiliates whether paid or unpaid, and all customers.&nbsp; Persons who visit or view   this website, whether intentionally or unintentionally, whether solicited or   unsolicited, are described herein as "Visitors" and are parties to this Privacy   Policy.&nbsp; Subscribers to lists or Newsletters are referred to herein as   "Subscribers" and are parties to the Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Persons who join an   organization or marketing endeavor (e.g. "affiliates") promoted by this website   are called "Members" herein and are covered by this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Finally,   anyone who orders, attempts to order, or receives a product sold (recipients) or   advertised on or delivered from this website, even at no cost, is called a   "Customer" herein and is subject to this Privacy Policy not only by passive   acceptance, but by virtue of the Purchase Agreement contract.&nbsp; The website, its   agents, owners, operators, and employees are referred to collectively herein as   "Website," "Site," and/or "Seller".</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>PERSONS EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE ARE   STILL COVERED</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">In the event that a person excluded from this   website because of the Terms of Use or from denial of service by the website,   who nonetheless unlawfully views this site, that person remains subject to the   terms of this Privacy Policy and is in violation of the Terms of Use.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>PERSONS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE ARE EXCLUDED   FROM THIS WEBSITE</strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><u>This website is not lawfully accessible to   persons under the age of 18 or who are otherwise covered by the provisions of   the Child Online Privacy Act of 1998 (COPA).&nbsp; If you are under the age of 18 you   must leave this site immediately.&nbsp; Fraudulent use of this website may make you   subject to civil or criminal sanctions.</u></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>VIEWING AND/OR USE AND/OR COMMUNICATION IS   CONSTRUED AS ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">Acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy is   a portion of the consideration required for your right to visit the website.&nbsp; If   you do not accept these terms, you have no right to visit this site and you are   fraudulently using this site.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>A NOTE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS (ONLINE   PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 --OPPA)</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">It is the intent of the Privacy Policy to comply   with the California Act.&nbsp; Various provisions throughout this Privacy Policy   address requirements of the act.&nbsp; In summary, you must presume that we collect   electronic information from all visitors.&nbsp; This is not usually personally   identifiable.&nbsp; If you purchase a product or service via this website (and   thereby become covered by the Act), the purchase agreement you electronically   sign prior to purchase allows the website to collect and archive all the   personal information you provide and to transmit and/or transfer that personal   information to third parties.&nbsp; There is no way you can modify this information   and you have no right to do so.&nbsp; Under the terms of the purchase agreement, you   have no right to view or receive any information about our database.&nbsp; In the   event that the website, under advice of counsel agrees to divulge information,   the requesting party must submit whatever information is demanded by the website   in order to insure that the website is releasing information to the correct   party.&nbsp; Other provisions of the OPPA may exempt this website from complying.&nbsp;   While we take measures to ensure that outside parties do not have access to any   information we have about you, we do not warranty that outside parties will not   breach our system and thus have access to your information.&nbsp; (You should know   that merchant service providers do not allow us access to your credit card   information.)&nbsp; This Privacy Policy also is subject to change without notice.&nbsp;   You are required to read it prior to using the website.&nbsp; By interacting with the   website you agree to the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy.&nbsp; By using   the website or purchasing a product through this website, you waive the right to   use state or federal court systems to address complaints and, instead, agree to   use the American Arbitration Association located in a city and county specified   herein.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS   WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">This website routinely collects information about   its visitors, subscribers, members, and customers.&nbsp; This information is obtained   in various ways, such as:</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER   INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 'REGISTRATION'</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">Registration means that the Visitor, Subscriber,   Member or Customer takes active, positive steps to communicate information to   this website.&nbsp; This can include pages or 'pop ups' where you register for a   newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it can include your participation in   visitor surveys; it can include requesting information from the website via   email, mail, or courier; it may be from joining an affiliate program or other   membership organization, paid or unpaid; it may be from ordering a product.</p>
        <p align="justify">Occasionally complete credit card information may   be provided to the website via fax or a fill-in form rather than regular secure   merchant service processing.&nbsp; This information is kept at the highest level of   security and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service provider or   for the purpose of communication with the customer.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>ONLINE ORDERING</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication   provided by shopping cart services supporting merchant service companies like   Visa and Master Card provides information to the website but does not provide   complete credit card numbers.&nbsp; In the process of online ordering, the customer   provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone number, CVV2 (back of   card) number, and, occasionally a member password.&nbsp; You should consider all this   information available to the website.&nbsp; This information is used to deliver the   product, but under the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for general   solicitation purposes.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">Website visitors who wish to communicate with the   website do so under two conditions:&nbsp; one, they give their permission for contact   by the website; two, they are subject to any ‘submission’ provisions of the   Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; While your email   address may or may not be used to solicit you, it is added to the website's   general solicitation database.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>CUSTOMER EMAIL OR   TESTIMONIALS</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">If you are a customer and send an email to the   website, or if you communicate with the site by phone or mail, the website   collects information about your communication and by communicating with the site   you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise use any   information collected as the site sees fit.</p>
        <p align="justify">Any communication which, in its sole discretion,   the site deems to be a testimonial, may be publicized for commercial   purposes.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR   INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS, OR SITE ADVERTISERS</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">Visitors clicking on banners or pop-ups or   hyperlinked advertising, appearing on this website must assume that information   is being collected about them.&nbsp; This site is not responsible for the use of   information collected in such a fashion.&nbsp; Visitors must assume that (1)   information will be collected, (2) that ‘cookies’ will usually be placed on   their hard drive, (3) that website does not have any control over what happens   with this information, (4) that website takes no responsibility over the   accuracy or content of advertisers, (5) that website is not responsible for   downloads from third party advertisers that contain viruses or worms or other   computer code that causes their computer or software harm, and (6) that website   assumes no responsibility for the data that is garnered from the click itself or   that the advertiser collects. </p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM REFERRING EMAIL   OR REFERRING URLS</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">If you send a friend an email from this site or if   you send the url or one of our web pages to a friend, you must assume that some   data is collected about your IP address or your email address and that of your   friend.&nbsp; You must assume that referred emails or web pages may appear to come   from your email.&nbsp; You must accept fully responsibility for referring pages or   email to a friend and agree to indemnify this site for any damage, intentional   or unintentional that results from said referrals.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VOLUNTARY   VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER OR CUSTOMER SURVEYS</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">Unless otherwise specified in the survey, you must   assume that any information provided to the website as part of a survey in which   you participate may be used for general solicitation for commercial purposes and   that such information will be shared with joint venture partners, affiliates,   marketing organization or used by the site itself for product design or   solicitation purposes.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ELECTRONIC MEANS   AND 'COOKIES'</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">Many websites, including this one, collect   information about your computer, your email address, your IP address.&nbsp; You must   assume that your web-viewing or web-use activity is monitored, tracked, and   information collected.&nbsp; This information is not usually of a personal nature,   but it may help define your viewing habits and product preferences even though   the website may or may not have any idea who you are.</p>
        <p align="justify">"Cookies" is web jargon for bits of computer code   placed on your hard drive.&nbsp; Websites use this to keep you 'logged in', to keep   track of search criteria, to monitor use, to password protect use of the site or   use of products sold by the site.&nbsp; Cookies can also be used to obtain   information about your computer configuration or your use of your computer.</p>
        <p align="justify">Cookies can be used to electronically gather   information about you.&nbsp; Again, it may or may not be personal information, but it   is information and by using this site you are expressly giving permission to use   'cookies' and to use the information gathered from their use to benefit you.&nbsp;   You also give permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and use any information   collected for product design, product offers to you, and general commercial   solicitation purposes by this site or joint venture partners, affiliates, and   marketing organizations.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>HOW INFORMATION MAY BE USED</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">The use of information as described below may or   may not be how information that is collected is customarily used by this site.&nbsp;   While actual use of any information collected may be used quite conservatively,   you must assume that it is not.&nbsp; You must assume that information collected is   shared with other persons or entities for commercial purposes.&nbsp; While this is   uncommon in practice, you must assume that it is as you make your decision   whether or not to view or interact with this website.&nbsp; This type of shared   information may include your name, address, phone number, email address and   buying habits, as well as other information.&nbsp; This information may be used for   general commercial solicitation by this website or other persons it is sold to,   rented to, or shared with.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>INFORMATION THAT IS NOT   SHARED</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">Credit card information or other financial   information is not usually known to the website.&nbsp; However, in the event that it   is made known, that information is never revealed to anyone except to processing   authorities or law enforcement agencies.&nbsp; However, the provider of such   information gives express permission to use it in fraud investigation or for   litigation.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>BULLETIN BOARDS AND PUBLIC   FORUMS</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">Visitors, subscribers, members, or customers who   use any site provided bulletin boards or other public forums, such as chat   rooms, do so at their own risk.&nbsp; You may not assume that the site monitors these   services or protects you in any manner from information you post publicly or   share with anyone else via these services.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>SPAM&nbsp; </strong></p>
        <p align="justify">By providing to this website information that   forms the basis of communication with you, such as an email address, you waive   all rights to file complaints concerning unsolicited email or spam from this   website since, by providing such information, you agree to receive communication   from us or other marketing organizations.&nbsp; However, all email communication with   you shall contain an 'unsubscribe' link where you may notify the website that   you no longer wish to receive solicitations or information from the website and   your name will be removed from the general solicitation database.</p>
