<h3 title="1. Information Collected by DreamBox Learning">1. Information Collected by DreamBox Learning</h3>
<p>
    In order for a child to participate in the DreamBox Learning Beta Program, the DreamBox 
	Learning Free Trial Program, the DreamBox Learning Elementary School Math Program, including 
	the K-2 Math Program, and/or other DreamBox Learning products (the "Programs"), the parents 
	or a legal guardian or of that child or an authorized school official must first register 
	at the DreamBox Learning website. If you do not register at our website, you and your child 
	will not be able to use the Programs. This registration process will require you to provide 
	your name, mailing address, email address, phone number and, if payment will be required 
	for the Programs, your credit card information, including billing address. Once you have 
	registered, you may then sign up your child or children for the Programs by providing your 
	child's first and last name, gender, date of birth, their current school grade level, and 
	the relationship of the child to you. We call this information "Registration Information." 
	We will also require a process to verify your consent to the registration of your child and 
	to the collection of your child's Registration Information.
</p>
<h3 title="2. How DreamBox Learning will use the information collected from you">2. How DreamBox Learning will use the information collected from you</h3>
<p>
    <span class="underline">Mailing Address:</span>
    Your mailing address may be used to allow DreamBox Learning to mail you and/or your child 
	various Program materials and ancillary program products.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="underline">Email Address:</span>
    Your email address will serve as your login username. Your email address may be used to send 
	a confirmation email at registration, as well as information and updates to the Programs. We 
	will also email your child's personal reports to you, with further information about the 
	progress your child is making on the Programs. We may use the email address as an additional 
	means of communicating with you about the Programs and DreamBox Learning, including notifying 
	you of updates to the Web Site or its related policies.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="underline">Credit Card Information:</span>
    With your consent, we may use and save your credit card information to bill you for each 
	child that you register for the Programs.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="underline">Phone Number</span>: Your phone number will serve as an alternate 
	way of contacting you for the same purposes as the email address.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="underline">Child's Name:</span>
    Your child's name will be used to customize your child's participation in the Programs, as 
	well as to personalize the reports and updates about your child's progress in the Programs. 
	In addition, we may mail related material to your child using his/her name, care of you, at 
	the mailing address that you provide.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="underline">Relationship to Child:</span>
    Your relationship to the Child will be used for profile and tracking purposes and to 
	personalize your child's reports.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="underline">Child's Date of Birth:</span>
    We will use a child's age to group Performance Data of children of similar age so we can 
	assess performance by age, and improve the program.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="underline">Child's School Grade Level:</span>
    We will use a child's grade level to group Performance Data of children of similar grade 
	levels so we can assess performance by grade level, and improve the program.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="underline">Child's Gender:</span>
    We will use a child's gender to personalize the Program's experience. In addition, we will 
	use a child's gender to group Performance Data of children of the same gender so we can 
	assess performance by gender, and improve the program.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="underline">Secondary Uses:</span>
    Registration Information and other information may be used by us for demographic profiling 
	and targeted advertising, although in such cases, the information will be aggregated as 
	ANONYMOUS statistical information.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="underline">Participation History:</span>
    The details of any order you place and the Programs you or your child choose will be 
	collected for customer service, marketing and business purposes.
</p>
<h3 title="3. Information DreamBox Learning collects directly from your child">3. Information DreamBox Learning collects directly from your child</h3>
<p>
    DreamBox Learning collects information directly from your child, over the internet, in the 
	form of the interactions that your child makes when participating in the Programs. We refer 
	to the data resulting from such participation, which includes but is not limited to data on 
	when your child starts and stops a lesson, the responses your child makes to questions asked, 
	the timing of your child's responses, your child's choice of character and customizations, 
	and the choice of lessons to play as "Performance Data." We will use Performance Data to 
	(1) measure your child's performance in each lesson of the DreamBox Learning Programs and 
	to adapt the Programs to his or her learning needs, (2) analyze your child's Performance 
	Data, and provide you with periodic progress reports about your child's performance in the 
	Programs, and (3) improve the Programs.
    If we ever need to collect information that is not Performance Data directly from your 
	child, DreamBox Learning will seek your authorization prior to collecting such additional 
	information from your child.
    In addition, we may aggregate your child's Performance Data with the Performance Data of 
	other children participating in the Programs for marketing and other business related 
	purposes. Aggregate information will be ANONYMOUS and will not identify your child.
</p>
<h3 title="4. Opting-out of providing the information we request">4. Opting-out of providing the information we request</h3>
<p>
    Because the DreamBox Learning Programs are individualized and customized for each child, 
	all the information we request from you and your child is required for you and your child 
	to participate in the Programs, with the exception of certain information to be used for 
	our marketing purposes to you only. At any time, you may revoke your consent to allowing 
	your child to participate in the DreamBox Learning Programs or refuse to allow DreamBox 
	Learning to further use or collect your child's personal information. Any ANONYMOUS 
	performance data will be retained, but we will no longer use any identifiable information 
	regarding you or your child that you have provided. However, if you do any of the 
	foregoing, you and your child will not be able to participate in the Programs.
</p>
<h3 title="5. Reviewing and changing your information">5. Reviewing and changing your information</h3>
<p>
    You may review and modify your Registration Information at any time by accessing our website 
	using your password.
</p>
<h3 title="6. Consent">6. Consent</h3>
<p>
    In order to use the Programs, you will be asked to submit certain personal information about 
	your child and you and to authorize DreamBox Learning to use that information in a limited 
	number of ways. We will require you to review and submit a Parental Consent as part of the 
	registration process, which will require you to consent to our collection and use of 
	information directly from your child over the Internet as described above.
</p>
<h3 title="7. Password Protection">7. Password Protection</h3>
<p>
    You will be asked to select a password to access the Programs through our website, and this 
	password will be used to allow your child to use the Programs. Your password should be 
	kept confidential. Your password will also allow you to review and change the information 
	we collect about you and your child or children.
</p>
<h3 title="8. Protecting your information.">8. Protecting your information.</h3>
<p>
    No data transmissions over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, 
	we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do 
	so at your own risk. DreamBox Learning has multiple security measures in place to protect 
	the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that this Program is hosted in the United States. If you are visiting from the 
	European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ 
	from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States, 
	which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU or other regions and by providing 
	your personal data you consent to the use of your personal data for the uses identified above 
	in accordance with this Privacy Policy; and the transfer of your personal data to the United 
	States as indicated above.
</p>
<h3 title="9. Your information and third parties">9. Your information and third parties</h3>
<p>
    Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, DreamBox Learning WILL NOT disclose the information 
	that it obtains from you to third parties without your express written permission, or where 
	we believe, in good faith, that the law requires us to disclose the information.
</p>
<p>
    DreamBox Learning WILL NOT sell, trade, or assign any unaggregated personal information that 
	it collects to third parties outside of DreamBox Learning. We, however, may aggregate the 
	information that we collect from users of our website to create demographic profiles and 
	performance profiles regarding the progress of children who use the Programs. DreamBox 
	Learning may share aggregated information with advertisers, marketing professionals, or 
	potential investors. This aggregated information will be compiled and reported in the form 
	of ANONYMOUS group statistics only.
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, as DreamBox Learning continues to develop its 
	business, it might sell some or all of its assets. In such transactions, customer information 
	is generally one of the transferred business assets. An acquiring company would be required 
	to protect all information that DreamBox Learning collects from users of our website and 
	Programs in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h3 title="10. Unsolicited third-party promotional emails">10. Unsolicited third-party promotional emails</h3>
<p>
    DreamBox Learning will not send you unsolicited third-party promotional emails.
</p>
<h3 title="11. Use of cookies">11. Use of cookies</h3>
<p>
    As a standard practice, DreamBox Learning uses "cookies". A cookie is a small amount of 
	data sent to your browser from our web server and stored on your computer, then sent back 
	to the server by your browser each time you access our website. Cookies enable us to track 
	usage of our website. In addition, cookies are required for the operation of the Programs. 
	Please note that if you refuse the DreamBox Learning cookie (by turning cookies off in 
	your browser or by clicking "don't accept" if you have set your browser to warn you before 
	accepting cookies), our Programs will not work.
</p>
<p>
    Cookies cannot be used to gather personal information from your computer.
</p>
<h3 title="12. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act">12. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
<p>
    Congress has enacted a law called the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 
	(COPPA) which is designed to protect children's privacy during use of the Internet. 
	DreamBox Learning has implemented practices consistent with the guidelines provided by 
	the Federal Trade Commission to date.
</p>
<p>
    DreamBox Learning will never knowingly request personally identifiable information or 
	private content from anyone under the age of 13 without parental consent. If you subscribe 
	to our Programs, provided you are 18 years of age or older, you will be asked, at the time 
	of registration, whether you consent to allowing users under the age of 13 to use your 
	subscription and to be subject to this Privacy Policy. You must be the parent or legal 
	guardian to grant such consent. If we receive this parental consent, we may receive personal 
	information from children under the age of 13 listed on your subscription account in order 
	to provide our Programs and services to them. DREAMBOX LEARNING DOES NOT SHARE CHILDREN'S 
	PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES. If you are a parent or legal 
	guardian of a user under 13 you may, at any time, revoke your consent to allow your child 
	to use the Programs under your subscription, refuse to allow DreamBox Learning to further 
	use or collect your child's personal information, or direct DreamBox Learning to delete 
	all identifiable information regarding your child that you have provided. To do so, please 
	contact our Privacy Officer at the contact information below. However, if you do any of 
	the foregoing, your child will not be able to use the Programs.
</p>

</p>
<h3 title="13. The Children's Internet Protection Act">13. The Children's Internet Protection Act</h3>
<p>
    The Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) is a federal law enacted by Congress in 
	December 2000 to address concerns about access to offensive content over the Internet 
	on school and library computers. CIPA imposes certain types of requirements on any school 
	or library that receives funding support for Internet access or internal connections from 
	the "E-rate" program — a program that makes certain technology more affordable for 
	eligible schools and libraries. Our Programs do not provide links to external resources 
	or chat rooms, and do not contain any offensive or inappropriate matter. As a result, any 
	school or library that uses DreamBox Learning Programs will be fully compliant with CIPA. 
	If you would like more information about CIPA, please go to 
	<a href="http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/cipa.html" title="more information about CIPA" target="_blank">http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/cipa.html</a>.
</p>
<h3 title="14. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act">14. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</h3>
<p>
    The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a Federal law that protects the 
	privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds 
	under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.
</p>
<p>
    FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These 
	rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school 
	beyond the high school level.
</p>
<p>
    DreamBox Learning is fully compliant with FERPA. Specifically:
</p>
<p>
    Any sensitive online information is transmitted over secure channels.
</p>
<p>
    All student data are stored in ways that are not publicly accessible.
</p>
<p>
    Security audits are regularly performed to ensure data integrity.
</p>
<p>
    DreamBox Learning does not share student information with any third parties. If a school 
	requests that student data should be sent to a third party, with parental consent, DreamBox 
	Learning would send the data to the school and never directly to the third party.
</p>
<p>
    If you would like more information about FERPA, please go to <a href="http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html" title="more information about FERPA" target="_blank">http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html</a>.

<h3 title="15. Amendments">15. Amendments</h3>
<p>
    DreamBox Learning may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you by 
	email regarding any material changes to our privacy and security practices. Please review 
	all revisions to the Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our website(s) and the Programs 
	after the date DreamBox Learning has emailed such notices will be deemed to be your agreement 
	to the changed terms.
