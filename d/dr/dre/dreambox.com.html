            <h2>DreamBox Learning feels strongly about protecting your privacy and the privacy of your students.</h2>
<p>
  DreamBox Learning WILL NOT sell, trade, or assign any unaggregated, personally-identifiable
  personal information that it collects to third parties outside of DreamBox Learning. If you
  have any questions, concerns or comments regarding this privacy policy, you may contact us
  at the email and address posted at the end of this policy statement. We are committed to
  addressing your privacy or security questions or concerns.
</p>
<h3>1. Information Collected by DreamBox Learning</h3>
<p>
  In order for a student to participate in the DreamBox Learning Beta Program, the DreamBox
  Learning Free Trial Program, the DreamBox Learning Elementary School Math Program, including
  the K-3 Math Program, and/or other DreamBox Learning products (the “Programs”), the parents
  or a legal guardian or of that student or an authorized school official must first register
  at the DreamBox Learning website. If you do not register at our website, you and your student(s)
  will not be able to use the Programs. This registration process will require you to provide
  your name and email address. For home accounts we require your phone number and, if payment will be required
  for the Programs, your credit card information, including your billing address. Once you have
  registered, you may then sign up your student(s) for the Programs by providing each
  student’s first and last name, gender, their current school grade level, and
  for home accounts, their date of birth. We call this information “Registration Information.”
  We will also require a process to verify your consent to the registration of your student and
  to the collection of your student’s Registration Information.
</p>
<h3>2. How DreamBox Learning will use the information collected from you</h3>
<p>
  <span class="underline">Email Address:</span>
  Your email address will serve as your login username. Your email address may be used to send
  a confirmation email at registration, as well as information and updates to the Programs. In some cases we
  will also email your student’s personal reports to you, with further information about the
  progress your student is making on the Programs. We may use the email address as an additional
  means of communicating with you about the Programs and DreamBox Learning, including notifying
  you of updates to the Web Site or its related policies.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="underline">Student’s Name:</span>
  Your student’s name will be used to customize your student’s participation in the Programs, as
  well as to personalize the reports and updates about your student’s progress in the Programs.
  In addition, in some cases we may mail related material to your student using his/her name, care of you, at
  the mailing address that you provide.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="underline">Phone Number:</span>
  Your phone number will serve as an alternate way of contacting you for the same purposes as the email address.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="underline">Credit Card Information:</span>
  In some cases, with your consent, we may use and save your credit card information to bill you for each
  student that you register for the Programs.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="underline">Student’s Date of Birth:</span>
  We will use a student’s age to group Performance Data of children of similar age so we can
  assess performance by age, and improve the program.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="underline">Student’s School Grade Level:</span>
  We will use a student’s grade level to group Performance Data of children of similar grade
  levels so we can assess performance by grade level, and improve the program.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="underline">Student’s Gender:</span>
  We will use a student’s gender to personalize the Program’s experience. In addition, we will
  use a student’s gender to group Performance Data of children of the same gender so we can
  assess performance by gender, and improve the program.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="underline">Mailing Address:</span>
  Your mailing address may be used to allow DreamBox Learning to mail you and/or your student various
  Program materials and ancillary program products.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="underline">Secondary Uses:</span>
  Registration Information and other information may be used by us for demographic profiling
  and targeted advertising, although in such cases, the information will be aggregated as
  ANONYMOUS statistical information. DreamBox Learning WILL NOT sell, trade, or assign any
  unaggregated personal information that it collects to third parties outside of DreamBox Learning.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="underline">Participation History:</span>
  The details of any order you place and the Programs you or your student choose will be
  collected for customer service, marketing and business purposes.
</p>
<h3>3. Information DreamBox Learning collects directly from your student</h3>
<p>
  DreamBox Learning collects information directly from your student, over the internet, in the
  form of the interactions that your student makes when participating in the Programs. We refer
  to the data resulting from such participation, which includes but is not limited to data on
  when your student starts and stops a lesson, the responses your student makes to questions asked,
  the timing of your student’s responses, your student’s choice of character and customizations,
  and the choice of lessons to play as “Performance Data.” We will use Performance Data to
  (1) measure your student’s performance in each lesson of the DreamBox Learning Programs and
  to adapt the Programs to his or her learning needs, (2) analyze your student’s Performance
  Data, and provide you with periodic progress reports about your student’s performance in the
  Programs, and (3) improve the Programs.
  If we ever need to collect information that is not Performance Data directly from your
  student, DreamBox Learning will seek your authorization prior to collecting such additional
  information from your student.
  In addition, we may aggregate your student’s Performance Data with the Performance Data of
  other students participating in the Programs for marketing and other business related
  purposes. Aggregate information will be ANONYMOUS and will not identify your student.
</p>
<h3>4. Opting-out of providing the information we request</h3>
<p>
  Because the DreamBox Learning Programs are individualized and customized for each student,
  all the information we request from you and your student is required for you and your student
  to participate in the Programs, with the exception of certain information to be used for
  our marketing purposes to you only. At any time, you may revoke your consent to allowing
  your student to participate in the DreamBox Learning Programs or refuse to allow DreamBox
  Learning to further use or collect your student’s personal information. Any ANONYMOUS
  performance data will be retained, but we will no longer use any identifiable information
  regarding you or your student that you have provided. However, if you do any of the
  foregoing, you and your student will not be able to participate in the Programs.
</p>
<h3>5. Reviewing and changing your information</h3>
<p>
  You may review and modify your Registration Information at any time by accessing our website
  using your password.
</p>
<h3>6. Consent</h3>
<p>
  In order to use the Programs, you will be asked to submit certain personal information about
  your student and you and to authorize DreamBox Learning to use that information in a limited
  number of ways. We will require you to review and submit a Parental Consent as part of the
  registration process, which will require you to consent to our collection and use of
  information directly from your student over the Internet as described above.
</p>
<h3>7. Password Protection</h3>
<p>
  You will be asked to select a password to access the Programs through our website, and this
  password will be used to allow your student to use the Programs. Your password should be
  kept confidential. Your password will also allow you to review and change the information
  we collect about you and your student or students.
</p>
<h3>8. Protecting your information.</h3>
<p>
  No data transmissions over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently,
  we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do
  so at your own risk. DreamBox Learning has multiple security measures in place to protect
  the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that this Program is hosted in the United States. If you are visiting from the
  European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ
  from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States,
  which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU or other regions and by providing
  your personal data you consent to the use of your personal data for the uses identified above
  in accordance with this Privacy Policy; and the transfer of your personal data to the United
  States as indicated above.
</p>
<h3>9. Your information and third parties</h3>
<p>
  Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, DreamBox Learning WILL NOT disclose the information
  that it obtains from you to third parties without your express written permission, or where
  we believe, in good faith, that the law requires us to disclose the information.
</p>
<p>
  DreamBox Learning WILL NOT sell, trade, or assign any unaggregated personal information that
  it collects to third parties outside of DreamBox Learning. We, however, may aggregate the
  information that we collect from users of our website to create demographic profiles and
  performance profiles regarding the progress of students who use the Programs. DreamBox
  Learning may share aggregated information with advertisers, marketing professionals, or
  potential investors. This aggregated information will be compiled and reported in the form
  of ANONYMOUS group statistics only.
</p>
<p>
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, as DreamBox Learning continues to develop its
  business, it might sell some or all of its assets. In such transactions, customer information
  is generally one of the transferred business assets. An acquiring company would be required
  to protect all information that DreamBox Learning collects from users of our website and
  Programs in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h3>10. Unsolicited third-party promotional emails</h3>
<p>
  DreamBox Learning will not send you unsolicited third-party promotional emails.
</p>
<h3>11. Use of cookies</h3>
<p>
  As a standard practice, DreamBox Learning uses “cookies”. A cookie is a small amount of
  data sent to your browser from our web server and stored on your computer, then sent back
  to the server by your browser each time you access our website. Cookies enable us to track
  usage of our website. In addition, cookies are required for the operation of the Programs.
  Please note that if you refuse the DreamBox Learning cookie (by turning cookies off in
  your browser or by clicking “don’t accept” if you have set your browser to warn you before
  accepting cookies), our Programs will not work.
</p>
<p>
  Cookies cannot be used to gather personal information from your computer.
</p>
<h3>12. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
<p>
  Congress has enacted a law called the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998
  (COPPA) which is designed to protect children’s privacy during use of the Internet.
  DreamBox Learning has implemented practices consistent with the guidelines provided by
  the Federal Trade Commission to date.
</p>
<p>
  DreamBox Learning will never knowingly request personally identifiable information or
  private content from anyone under the age of 13 without parental consent. If you subscribe
  to our Programs, provided you are 18 years of age or older, you will be asked, at the time
  of registration, whether you consent to allowing users under the age of 13 to use your
  subscription and to be subject to this Privacy Policy. You must be the parent or legal
  guardian to grant such consent. If we receive this parental consent, we may receive personal
  information from children under the age of 13 listed on your subscription account in order
  to provide our Programs and services to them. DREAMBOX LEARNING DOES NOT SHARE CHILDREN’S
  PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES. If you are a parent or legal
  guardian of a user under 13 you may, at any time, revoke your consent to allow your student
  to use the Programs under your subscription, refuse to allow DreamBox Learning to further
  use or collect your student’s personal information, or direct DreamBox Learning to delete
  all identifiable information regarding your student that you have provided. To do so, please
  contact our Privacy Officer at the contact information below. However, if you do any of
  the foregoing, your student will not be able to use the Programs.
</p>
<p>

  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm" target="_blank" title="more information about COPPA">please go to http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm</a>.
</p>
<h3>13. The Children’s Internet Protection Act</h3>
<p>
  The Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) is a federal law enacted by Congress in
  December 2000 to address concerns about access to offensive content over the Internet
  on school and library computers. CIPA imposes certain types of requirements on any school
  or library that receives funding support for Internet access or internal connections from
  the “E-rate” program — a program that makes certain technology more affordable for
  eligible schools and libraries. Our Programs do not provide links to external resources
  or chat rooms, and do not contain any offensive or inappropriate matter. As a result, any
  school or library that uses DreamBox Learning Programs will be fully compliant with CIPA.
  If you would like more information about CIPA, please go to
  <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/cipa.html" target="_blank" title="more information about CIPA">http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/cipa.html</a>.
</p>
<h3>14. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</h3>
<p>
  The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a Federal law that protects the
  privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds
  under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.
</p>
<p>
  FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children’s education records. These
  rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school
  beyond the high school level.
</p>
<p>
  DreamBox Learning is fully compliant with FERPA. Specifically:
</p>
<p>
  Any sensitive online information is transmitted over secure channels.
</p>
<p>
  All student data are stored in ways that are not publicly accessible.
</p>
<p>
  Security audits are regularly performed to ensure data integrity.
</p>
<p>
  DreamBox Learning does not share student information with any third parties. If a school
  requests that student data should be sent to a third party, with parental consent, DreamBox
  Learning would send the data to the school and never directly to the third party.
</p>
<p>
  If you would like more information about FERPA, please go to
  <a href="http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html" target="_blank" title="more information about FERPA">http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html</a>.
</p>
<h3>15. Amendments</h3>
<p>
  DreamBox Learning may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you by
  email regarding any material changes to our privacy and security practices. Please review
  all revisions to the Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our website(s) and the Programs
  after the date DreamBox Learning has emailed such notices will be deemed to be your agreement
  to the changed terms.
