<p>Third party links This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  </p>
<p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personal information.  </p>
<p>This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.</p> 
<p>In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, we may choose various third party Web sites to link to, and/or frame within the Site. We also participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer e-commerce and other services and features to our visitors and account holders. However, even if the third party is affiliated with us, we have no control over these linked sites, each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us. Data collected by our co-brand partners or third party Web sites (even if offered on or through our site) may not be received by us. As such, we have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such Web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of the DRIVERS-LICENSES features and the links placed upon each of them and therefore request any feedback on not only the DRIVERS-LICENSES features, but for sites each links to as well (including if a specific link does not work).</p>
<p>Further, any linking with any other Web site is neither an endorsement of that site nor any of the products or services which may be offered on that site. We make no representation or warranty regarding any third party Websites or their use of your PERSONAL INFORMATION.</p>

<h4>Surveys</h4>
<p>From time-to-time, we request information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as your email address), and demographic information (such as interests or age level). Survey information may be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the DRIVERS-LICENSES Features and services.

<h4>Your Consent</h4>
<p>By submitting a quote request, you authorize us to provide your information to insurance agents, both local and national. You also authorize this Site to provide your information to one of our third party agent networks in the event that our primary agent network has few or no agents in your zip code. You authorize these agent networks to share your information with their vendors, suppliers, and insurance carriers in order to generate information for your quotes. By submitting a quote request, you acknowledge that this Site's service requires you to agree that our partner companies may obtain a consumer report or credit score from a consumer reporting agency (also known as a credit bureau) and that these partner companies do not have the right to obtain a consumer report or credit score without your written instruction which you are granting by clicking the submit button. Accordingly, by submitting a quote request you instruct consumer reporting agencies to provide a consumer report or credit score on you to these partner companies if requested within a reasonable date from the time you submit information to this Site. In the event that one of our partner companies obtains this credit information such partner company will not share this information with any other party, including insurance carriers, but insurance carriers may elect to obtain credit information on their own in connection with the quoting and underwriting of the requested insurance. Where permitted by law, some insurance companies or their agents may confirm your information, through the use of consumer reports, which may include credit score and driving record.</p>

<h4>Anti-Spam Policy</h4>

If you feel you have been sent spam, please email us at <a href="mailto:info@Drivers-licenses.org">info@Drivers-licenses.org</a> and we'll immediately take steps to solve the problem. We hold the privacy of all users in the highest regard, as well as the recipients of emails sent by our advertisers. </p>

<h4>The Federal CAN-SPAM Act</h4>
<p>The Federal CAN-SPAM Act, put into law in 2003, dictates rules in sending commercial email. We vigorously follow these rules and add a few more for added safety.</p>

<h4>California Privacy Rights</h4>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, permits our Web site users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the PERSONAL INFORMATION (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, should you be a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to: Drivers-licenses.org at  3313 W.
