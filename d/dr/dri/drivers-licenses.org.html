			 your IP address, UDID or other unique identifier ("<strong>Device Identifier</strong>"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically
			assigned to your Device used to access the Site, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;

	subsequent technology and methods later developed):
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><em>Cookies</em></strong>
		. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a
		Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local
		storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available
		as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use
		will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective
with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe's web site <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">www.adobe.com</a>. Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your
		Device, some parts of our Site may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Site your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser
		settings and limitations.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong><em>Web Beacons</em></strong>
		. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in our Site's pages
		and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a
		web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Site, to
		monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links
		were actually viewed.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong><em>Embedded Scripts</em></strong>
		. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on.
		The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to
		the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong><em>Browser Fingerprinting</em></strong>
		. Collection and analysis of information from your Device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data,
		for purposes of identification.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong><em>ETag, or entity tag</em></strong>
		. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the
		resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag
		tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash and/or HTML5 cookies.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong><em>Recognition Technologies</em></strong>
		. Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about
		users and devices (<em>e.g.</em>, that a user of multiple devices is the same user).
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><em>Strictly Necessary</em></strong>
		. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our Site, including cookies
		required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of Site functionality.
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><em>Performance‑Related</em></strong>
		. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Site, including as part of our analytic
		practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered through the Site.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong><em>Functionality‑Related</em></strong>
		. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are required to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing the Site, including
		identifying you when you visit our Site or keeping track of our specified preferences, including in terms of the presentation of content on our Site.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong><em>Targeting‑Related</em></strong>
		. We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content relevant to your interests on our Site and third‑party sites based on how you interact with
		our content. This includes using Tracking Technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the content that have been delivered to you.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Site. Further, third parties may use Tracking
	Technologies in connection with our Site, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web
	sites or online services. We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them. However, you consent to potentially
	encountering third-party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Site and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to
	the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.
</p>
<h4>

</h4>
<p>
	We may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Site, such as when they submit your information to us. Additionally, we may,
	from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Site with outside records from third parties for various purposes,
	including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. To the extent we
	combine information we receive from those sources with your Personal Information we collect on the Site, it will be treated as Personal Information and we
	will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise. In no other circumstances do our statements under this
	Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.
</p>
<h4>
	<a class="anchor" id="dinformation"></a>
	<strong>(d)</strong>
	<strong>Interactions with Third Party Services </strong>
</h4>
<p>
	The Site may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Site and your account on a third-party web site, application or
	other service. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us. For
	example, we may provide third-party sites' interfaces or links on the Site to facilitate your sending a communication from the Site. For example, we may
	use third parties to facilitate emails, Tweets or Facebook postings. These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such
	communications or other activities and these third parties' practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy. Company may not control or have access to your
	communications through these third parties. Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and

	Site.
</p>

	<a class="anchor" id="einformation"></a>
	<strong> (e) Information You Provide About a Third Party </strong>

	that person or we explicitly say otherwise. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Site, your email address, mobile
	number, name or user name and message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s).
</p>
<h4>
	<a class="anchor" id="finformation"></a>
	<strong>(f) California Do Not Track Disclosures</strong>
</h4>
<p>
	Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of
	information about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services (<em>e.g.</em>, browser do not
	track signals). Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms.
</p>
<h4>
	<strong>(g) </strong></h4>
	<p>
	Company has received TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy statement and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe
	program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this

	<a class="anchor" id="adsinfo"></a>
	<strong>4. Ads and Information About You</strong>
</h3>
<p>
	We and third parties, such as network advertisers and ad exchanges, may serve advertisements across the Internet and may use third party analytics service
	providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party sites and viewing of ads and of our
content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your activities across the Internet and mobile media ("	<strong>Behavioral Ads</strong>"). Behavioral Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which we believe you might be
	interested. If you object to receiving Behavioral Ads from us on third party sites, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below.
	Our third party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own technologies
	on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information via a Device Identifier. These third party technologies may be set to, among other things:
	(a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements; and (c) understand the
	usefulness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and
	may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by
	third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously
	described activities.
</p>
<p>
	Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that
	such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any
	available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party's terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed
	regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third party advertisers or
	advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.
</p>
<p>
Some third parties may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available	<u><a href="#chart">here</a></u>.Further, while sites use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a>, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative ("<strong>NAI</strong>") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the "opt-out" procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will	be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change	web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. You may also opt-out of receiving Behavioral Ads on participating sites and	services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance ("<strong>DAA</strong>") website at <u><a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a></u>. Similar limitations may apply to the DAA opt-out. We are not responsible for effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties' opt-out options or programs.

	associate their Tracking Technologies with you, independently collect information about you, including Personal Information, and may or may not have their
	own published privacy policies. We are not responsible for these third-party privacy policies or the practices of Third-Party Owners. Be sure to review any
