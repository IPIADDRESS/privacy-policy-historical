<h4>Automatic Information</h4>
<p>In the process of operating our Web site(s) and interacting with you we may automatically collect and analyze a variety of information. This information may include but is not limited to, the internet protocol (IP) address, computer and connection setting browser plug-in types and versions operating system and platform; purchase and participation history; products you viewed or searched for; and the ways you used to contact us. Additionally, we may use pixel tracking technology to track the completion of transactions with us or our advertisers, the source information for those transactions, and your IP address, date/time stamp, browser type, and referring URL.</p>
<p>We also may use browser data such as cookies or software tools to measure and collect session information. Cookies are small bits of electronic information that a Web site can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit to the site. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many Web sites use them. Cookies allow us to better customize visits to our site to the visitor's individual preferences.

If you choose, there are utilities available for purchase from independent software providers to install on your computer as well as tools/preferences you can choose through most web browsers to make website visits anonymous. However, if you employ one of these utilities while using our site, we will be unable to generate your form/s. Notwithstanding anything else herein, we may partner with third party advertisers who may (themselves or through their partners) place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.

<p>We share your personal information with third parties only in ways that are described in this privacy statement.  </p>
<p>We may provide your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. </p>

<h4>Third party links </h4>
<p>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  </p>
<p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.  </p>
<p>This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site. </p>
<p>In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, we may choose various third party Web sites to link to, and/or frame within the Site. We also participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer e-commerce and other services and features to our visitors and account holders. However, even if the third party is affiliated with us, we have no control over these linked sites, each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us. Data collected by our co-brand partners or third party Web sites (even if offered on or through our site) may not be received by us. As such, we have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such Web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of the DRIVERS-LICENSES features and the links placed upon each of them and therefore request any feedback on not only the DRIVERS-LICENSES features, but for sites each links to as well (including if a specific link does not work).</p>
<p>Further, any linking with any other Web site is neither an endorsement of that site nor any of the products or services which may be offered on that site. We make no representation or warranty regarding any third party Websites or their use of your PERSONAL INFORMATION.</p>

<h4>Distribution Partners</h4>
<p>Website operators that license our ad serving technology pass information to us so that we may serve advertisements to you. The information passed may include, but is not limited to, your IP address, e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number(s), date of birth, and gender. </p>

<h4>Publisher Partners </h4>
<p>When you complete a registration or offer form that is hosted by one of our website publisher partners on our behalf, the website publisher partner may submit all or a portion of the information that you submitted on the form to us. This information may include, but is not limited to: your IP address, e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number(s), date of birth, gender, and payment information; information about your background, interests, health, education, career goals, and shopping preferences; and any other information you provide to our website publisher partner. </p>

<h4>Marketing Partners</h4>
<p>We may receive information about you, including but not limited to your IP address, e-mail address, first name, last name, mailing address, and telephone number(s), from third party marketing partners that provide us with consumer data to manage on their behalf. </p>

<h4>Surveys</h4>
<p>From time-to-time, we request information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as your email address), and demographic information (such as interests or age level). Survey information may be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the DRIVERS-LICENSES Features and services. We may also use information from these surveys to better distribute market and provide products and services to new and existing users.</p>

<h4>Your Consent</h4>
<p>By submitting a quote request, you authorize us to provide your information to insurance agents, both local and national. You also authorize this Site to provide your information to one of our third party agent networks in the event that our primary agent network has few or no agents in your zip code. You authorize these agent networks to share your information with their vendors, suppliers, and insurance carriers in order to generate information for your quotes. By submitting a quote request, you acknowledge that this Site's service requires you to agree that our partner companies may obtain a consumer report or credit score from a consumer reporting agency (also known as a credit bureau) and that these partner companies do not have the right to obtain a consumer report or credit score without your written instruction which you are granting by clicking the submit button. Accordingly, by submitting a quote request you instruct consumer reporting agencies to provide a consumer report or credit score on you to these partner companies if requested within a reasonable date from the time you submit information to this Site. In the event that one of our partner companies obtains this credit information such partner company will not share this information with any other party, including insurance carriers, but insurance carriers may elect to obtain credit information on their own in connection with the quoting and underwriting of the requested insurance. Where permitted by law, some insurance companies or their agents may confirm your information, through the use of consumer reports, which may include credit score and driving record.</p>

<h4>Anti-Spam Policy</h4>
<p>We have crafted a strong, zero-tolerance anti-spam policy to protect you. If you feel you have been sent spam, please email us at <a href="mailto:info@drivers-licenses.org">info@drivers-licenses.org</a> and we'll immediately take steps to solve the problem. We hold the privacy of all users in the highest regard, as well as the recipients of emails sent by our advertisers. </p>

<h4>The Federal CAN-SPAM Act</h4>
<p>The Federal CAN-SPAM Act, put into law in 2003, dictates rules in sending commercial email. We vigorously follow these rules and add a few more for added safety.</p>

<h4>Communicating with Children</h4>
<p>Our intention is to fully comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). Per COPPA guidelines, we do not knowingly collect PII from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian is made aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with PII through any point of contact, contact us and we will delete the information about the child referenced from our files.</p>
