<p>We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address you submitted to us) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding this information or our privacy practices, please contact us via email at <a href="mailto:info@Drivers-Licenses.org">info@Drivers-Licenses.org</a>.</p>

<h4>What information does Drivers-Licenses.org collect?</h4>
<p>We collect certain types of information and ask for PERSONAL INFORMATION such as your full name, age, gender, telephone number, ID number, date of birth, mobile telephone number (if you have a mobile phone), e-mail address, home address and/or zip code ("PERSONAL INFORMATION"). We may collect such PERSONAL INFORMATION when you fill out the License Easy Guide™. The following sections describe what type of information we collect, when we collect it and how we use it.</p>

<h4>Information you give us</h4>
<p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. For example, you provide information when you fill out the Drivers-Licenses.org License Easy Guide™. </p>

<h4>Automatic Information</h4>
<p>In the process of operating our Web site(s) and interacting with you we may automatically collect and analyze a variety of information. This information may include but is not limited to, the internet protocol (IP) address, computer and connection setting browser plug-in types and versions operating system and platform; purchase and participation history; products you viewed or searched for; and the ways you used to contact us. Additionally, we may use pixel tracking technology to track the completion of transactions with us or our advertisers, the source information for those transactions, and your IP address, date/time stamp, browser type, and referring URL.</p>
<p>We also may use browser data such as cookies or software tools to measure and collect session information. Cookies are small bits of electronic information that a Web site can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit to the site. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many Web sites use them. Cookies allow us to better customize visits to our site to the visitor's individual preferences. In addition, they allow us to pre-populate your form/s based on the information you provide to us. If cookies are disabled in your browser, we will be unable to generate your form and you may receive an error. If you choose, there are utilities available for purchase from independent software providers to install on your computer as well as tools/preferences you can choose through most web browsers to make website visits anonymous. However, if you employ one of these utilities while using our site, we will be unable to generate your form/s. Notwithstanding anything else herein, we may partner with third party advertisers who may (themselves or through their partners) place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. These cookies enable more customized ads, content or services to be provided to you. To trigger these cookies, we may pass an encrypted or "hashed" (non-human readable) identifier corresponding to your email address to a Web advertising partner, who may place a cookie on your computer. We do not receive or record any PERSONAL INFORMATION in the cookies we use. Although most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent that or to notify you when you are sent a cookie.</p>
<p>The use of third party cookies is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>

<h4>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h4>
<p>Our third party tracking utility partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a users computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers personally identifiable information. </p>
<p>We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails so that we know which e-mails have been opened. We use this information to monitor the effectiveness of our e-mail campaigns and to validate our results to our marketing partners. </p>
<p>We may also use log files, which are used to track and monitor traffic patterns on our site. </p>
