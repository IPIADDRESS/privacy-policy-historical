			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			
			<p>Our privacy is important to MaxPro Software, Inc. (“MaxPro”). This Privacy Policy describes the information practices for the MaxPro Sites, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. As described below, this statement also applies to your other interactions with MaxPro, such as when you license software subject to an End-User License Agreement or enter into Terms of Service for a MaxPro offering, or provide information to MaxPro at a trade show or other event.</p>

			<p><strong>What Information We Collect:</strong> This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected by or submitted to MaxPro (or carefully selected third parties acting on MaxPro's behalf), including personal information. "Personal information" is data that reasonably can be used to identify or describe an individual. You do not need to provide us personal information to simply browse our site.</p>
			
			<p>MaxPro collects personal information when:</p>
			
			
				<p>1. you make purchases of products or services;</p>
				<p>2. you register products online;</p>
				<p>3. you request support for a MaxPro product;</p>
				<p>4. you request free software downloads;</p>
				<p>5. you create a user account (login user name and password) on a MaxPro Site;</p>
				<p>6. you register for webcasts, seminars and roundtables;</p>
				<p>7. you request information or materials (e.g., whitepapers or newsletters);</p>
				<p>8. you participate in surveys and evaluations;</p>
				<p>9. you participate in promotions, contests or giveaways;</p>
				<p>10. you apply for a job, or submit your resume to MaxPro;</p>
				<p>11. you submit questions or comments to us.</p>
			
			
			<br>
			<p>MaxPro may also collect personal information from individuals (with their consent) at conventions, trade shows and expositions.</p>
			
			<p>The types of personal information collected may include (but are not limited to):</p>
			
			
				<p>1. your first and last name;</p>
				<p>2. your title and your company's name;</p>
				<p>3. your home, billing, or other physical address (including street name, name of a city or town, state/province, postal code);</p>
				<p>4. your e-mail address;</p>
				<p>5. your telephone number;</p>
				<p>6. (for job applicants submitting electronic information) your educational background, employment experience, and job interest;</p>
				<p>7. any other identifier that permits MaxPro to make physical or online contact with you;</p>
				<p>8. any information that MaxPro collects online from you and maintains in association with your account, such as: (a) your MaxPro username, (b) your MaxPro password, and/or (c) your credit card account information.</p>
			
			
			<p>Use of Your Personal Information: MaxPro collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve its sites and deliver the services or carry out the transactions you have requested. These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service; making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.</p>
			
			<p>We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. Some MaxPro services may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the service. We may also contact you to inform you of other products or services available from MaxPro and its affiliates.</p>
			
			<p>Personal information collected on MaxPro Sites and services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which MaxPro or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using a MaxPro Site or service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>
			
			<p>Sharing of Your Personal Information: MaxPro will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others. MaxPro shares personal information with companies working on our behalf and MaxPro-owned business entities. Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own marketing purposes unless you have provided consent.</p>
			
			<p>Some MaxPro services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both MaxPro and the other company may receive information collected as part of the co-branded services.</p>
			
			<p>In some cases MaxPro uses contractors to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is MaxPro's practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with MaxPro's policies. MaxPro may also allow carefully selected MaxPro partners to participate in limited marketing campaigns solely to promote MaxPro's products and services to you.</p>
			
			<p>If you request something from a MaxPro Site (for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials), we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information with others, such as MaxPro's business partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, and postal or government authorities (e.g., Customs authorities) involved in fulfillment. As part of a transaction, we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.</p>
			
			<p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>
			
			<p>We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on MaxPro; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of MaxPro (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of MaxPro services or members of the public.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Your Choices:</strong> MaxPro provides a number of ways for you to 'opt-out' of receiving additional information from us or having us provide your personal information to our partners. We may offer you these choices at the time you give us your information.</p>
			
			<p>If you do not wish to continue receiving certain marketing materials (e.g., e-mail messages), you can opt-out of receiving these materials by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the materials. This option does not apply to communications primarily for the purpose of administering orders, contracts, support, product safety warnings, software updates, or other administrative and transactional notices.</p>
			
			<p>How to Update Your Information: Here are some ways you can modify the contact information that you have provided to us:</p>
			
			
				<p>1. Email Newsletters: Should your email address change, you may manage your subscription by unsubscribing to our newsletter and re-subscribing with your new email address.</p>
				<p>2. Specialized Areas: Specialized areas of our web site that require you to register may identify, at the point of collection, the ways available for you to update your information.</p>
			
			
			<p>Safeguarding Your Personal Information: We recognize industry standards and employ security safeguards to protect information from unauthorized access and misuse. We use the most accurate and current information you provide in order to process your request. Furthermore, whenever you transmit sensitive information, such as credit card information, to us through our web site, we provide you access to our secure server that allows encryption across the Internet.

All acceptable browsers do provide detailed information on security levels in "Properties" or "Document Information" from the browser's menu bar. See your browser's "Help" tab or documentation for more information.</p>
			
			<p>If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone, you should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.</p>
