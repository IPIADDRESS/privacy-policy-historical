				<p style="font-size:14px;">Our privacy is important to MaxPro  Software, Inc. (“MaxPro”).  This Privacy Policy describes the  information practices for the MaxPro Sites, including what type of  information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and  with whom the information is shared. As described below, this  statement also applies to your other interactions with MaxPro, such  as when you license software subject to an End-User License Agreement  or enter into Terms of Service for a MaxPro offering, or provide  information to MaxPro at a trade show or other event. </p>
			
					<p><strong>What Information We Collect:</strong> This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected by or  submitted to MaxPro (or carefully selected third parties acting on  MaxPro's behalf), including personal information. "Personal  information" is data that reasonably can be used to identify or  describe an individual. You do not need to provide us personal  information to simply browse our site.</p>
					<p><strong>MaxPro collects personal information  when:</strong></p>
					<p>•you make purchases of products or  services;</p>
					<p>•you register products online;</p>
					<p>•you request support for a MaxPro  product;</p>
					<p>•you request free software downloads;</p>
					<p>•you create a user account (login  user name and password) on a MaxPro Site;</p>
					<p>•you register for webcasts, seminars  and roundtables;</p>
					<p>•you request information or materials  (e.g., whitepapers or newsletters);</p>
					<p>•you participate in surveys and  evaluations;</p>
					<p>•you participate in promotions,  contests or giveaways;</p>
					<p>•you apply for a job, or submit your  resume to MaxPro;</p>
					<p>•you submit questions or comments to  us.</p>
					<p>MaxPro may also collect personal  information from individuals (with their consent) at conventions,  trade shows and expositions.</p>
					<p><strong>The types of personal information  collected may include (but are not limited to):</strong></p>
					<p>•your first and last name;</p>
					<p>•your title and your company's name;</p>
					<p>•your home, billing, or other  physical address (including street name, name of a city or town,  state/province, postal code);</p>
					<p>•your e-mail address;</p>
					<p>•your telephone number;</p>
					<p>•(for job applicants submitting  electronic information) your educational background, employment  experience, and job interest;</p>
					<p>•any other identifier that permits  MaxPro to make physical or online contact with you;</p>
					<p>•any information that MaxPro collects  online from you and maintains in association with your account, such  as: (a) your MaxPro username, (b) your MaxPro password, and/or (c)  your credit card account information.</p>
					<p><strong>Use of Your Personal Information: </strong>MaxPro collects and uses your personal information to operate and  improve its sites and deliver the services or carry out the  transactions you have requested. These uses may include providing you  with more effective customer service; making the sites or services  easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the  same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving  our products, services and technologies; and displaying content and  advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.</p>
					<p>We also use your personal information  to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service  communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders,  information on technical service issues, and security announcements.  Some MaxPro services may send periodic member letters that are  considered part of the service. We may also contact you to inform you  of other products or services available from MaxPro and its  affiliates.</p>
					<p>Personal information collected on  MaxPro Sites and services may be stored and processed in the United  States or any other country in which MaxPro or its affiliates,  subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using a MaxPro  Site or service, you consent to any such transfer of information  outside of your country.</p>
					<p><strong>Sharing of Your Personal  Information: </strong>MaxPro will not sell, rent or lease your personal  information to others. MaxPro shares personal information with  companies working on our behalf and MaxPro-owned business entities.  Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your  personal information to third parties for their own marketing  purposes unless you have provided consent.</p>
					<p>Some MaxPro services may be co-branded  and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for  or use such services, both MaxPro and the other company may receive  information collected as part of the co-branded services.</p>
					<p>In some cases MaxPro uses contractors  to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its  behalf. It is MaxPro's practice to require such suppliers to handle  information in a manner consistent with MaxPro's policies. MaxPro may  also allow carefully selected MaxPro partners to participate in  limited marketing campaigns solely to promote MaxPro's products and  services to you.</p>
					<p>If you request something from a MaxPro  Site (for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific  marketing materials), we will use the information you provide to  fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information  with others, such as MaxPro's business partners, financial  institutions, shipping companies, and postal or government  authorities (e.g., Customs authorities) involved in fulfillment. As  part of a transaction, we may also contact you as part of our  customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.</p>
					<p>We occasionally hire other companies to  provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the  processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support,  hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical  analysis of our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain  only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They  are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and  are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>
					<p>We may access and/or disclose your  personal information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a)  comply with the law or legal process served on MaxPro; (b) protect  and defend the rights or property of MaxPro (including the  enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to  protect the personal safety of users of MaxPro services or members of  the public.</p>
					<p><strong>Your Choices:</strong> MaxPro provides a  number of ways for you to 'opt-out' of receiving additional  information from us or having us provide your personal information to  our partners. We may offer you these choices at the time you give us  your information. </p>
					<p>If you do not wish to continue  receiving certain marketing materials (e.g., e-mail messages), you  can opt-out of receiving these materials by following the unsubscribe  instructions provided in the materials. This option does not apply to  communications primarily for the purpose of administering orders,  contracts, support, product safety warnings, software updates, or  other administrative and transactional notices.</p>
					<p><strong>How to Update Your Information</strong>:   Here are some ways you can modify the contact information that you  have provided to us:</p>
					<p>•Email Newsletters: Should your email  address change, you may manage your subscription by unsubscribing to  our newsletter and re-subscribing with your new email address.</p>
					<p>•Specialized Areas: Specialized areas  of our web site that require you to register may identify, at the  point of collection, the ways available for you to update your  information.</p>
					<p><strong>Safeguarding Your Personal  Information</strong>:  We recognize industry standards and employ security  safeguards to protect information from unauthorized access and  misuse. We use the most accurate and current information you provide  in order to process your request. Furthermore, whenever you transmit  sensitive information, such as credit card information, to us through  our web site, we provide you access to our secure server that allows  encryption across the Internet. Browsers offer varying degrees of  security, particularly in regard to encryption. Even the same version  of a browser can come with different levels of encryption. For your  protection, make sure your browser is set and configured to support  Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 2.0/3.0 and employs 128-bit encryption. All  acceptable browsers do provide detailed information on security  levels in "Properties" or "Document Information"  from the browser's menu bar. See your browser's "Help" tab  or documentation for more information.</p>
					<p>If a password is used to help protect  your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to  keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with  anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone, you should always  log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your  information from subsequent users.</p>
					<p><strong>Enforcement</strong>:  MaxPro regularly  reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to  direct any questions or concerns regarding this statement or MaxPro's  treatment of personal information by contacting us at the link or  address indicated below. </p>

We use this data  to better understand web site usage in the aggregate so that we know  what areas of our web site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of  visits to those areas).
