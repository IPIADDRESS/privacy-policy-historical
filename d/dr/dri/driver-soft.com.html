Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset   your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.   However, Driver-Soft.com features and services may not function properly if your   cookies are disabled. </p>

    When you use Driver-Soft.com, our servers   automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a   website. These server logs may include information such as your web request,   Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of   your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. </p>
  <p align="left">Driver-Soft.com processes personal information on our servers in   the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process   personal information on a server outside your own country. We only process   personal information to provide our own services. </p>
  <p align="left">Choices for personal information<br>
    When you sign up for a   particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal   information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose   for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. </p>
  <p align="left">If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other   than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we   will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information   for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for   purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific   service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. </p>
  <p align="left">Information security <br>
    We take appropriate security measures to   protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or   destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection,   storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical   security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store   personal data. </p>
  <p align="left">We restrict access to personal information to Driver-Soft.com.   employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to   operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by   confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including   termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. </p>
  <p align="left">Data integrity <br>
    Driver-Soft.com processes personal information   only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this   Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data   collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect,   store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our   services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we   process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update   or correct their personal information whenever necessary. </p>
  <p align="left">Changes to this policy<br>
    Please note that this Privacy Policy may   change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy   without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor.   Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are   significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain   services, email notification of Policy changes). Each version of this Policy   will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will   also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. </p>
