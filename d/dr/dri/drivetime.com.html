<h1>Our Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
      At DriveTime, we believe that the confidentiality and protection of your personal information is one of our fundamental responsibilities. We want you to know that you can count on us to protect the privacy and security of your customer information and to provide you with the responsive, professional service you deserve.
      </p>
      <p>
      While you can visit and browse through the DriveTime.com website without disclosing who you are or providing any other personal information about yourself, some key features of the site require us to collect information from our users. By using this site, you agree to the terms of this privacy policy.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Information Collection and Use</strong><br>
      We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law. Nonpublic, personal information includes any information about you that you or someone else has provided to us and that is not publicly available as well as information about your transactions with us. This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Information we receive from a consumer-reporting agency.
      </li><li>Your payment history if you have previously purchased a vehicle from us.
      </li><li>Information we collect from you via the credit application page located at <a href="/getapproved/default.aspx">http://www.drivetime.com/getapproved/</a>.
      </li></ul>
      <p>
      We may, however, disclose certain information to government agencies, consumer-reporting agencies, and other outside parties as permitted or required by the Federal Privacy Act and other applicable laws. These disclosures are typically made for specific, limited purposes, such as verifying individuals‚Äô identities, reducing fraud and identity theft, verifying information or credit approvals, and reporting transactions to credit reporting agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
      DriveTime is also committed to preventing others from gaining unauthorized access to your customer information, and we enforce our privacy policies through the use of processes, procedures, and technology specifically designed to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
      In addition, we restrict access to your information by our employees and agents to that of business purposes only. Agents may include third parties who help service your account or help provide our products and services to you. We may also enter into joint marketing arrangements with other parties to make you aware of products or services we think you might be interested in. We require any party who has access to your information to maintain the confidentiality of the information and not use it for their own purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you specifically request us to provide nonpublic personal information to anyone, such as mortgage companies or other lenders, we will provide the information only upon your written or verified email authorization.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Encrypted Data Transmission</strong><br>
      This Web site secures your private information using a VeriSign SSL Certificate. Information exchanged with any address beginning with ‚Äúhttps‚Äù is encrypted using SSL before it is transmitted.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>About Cookies</strong><br>
      A cookie is a small text file containing information that a Web site stores on your computer's hard disk so the site can remember something about you at a later time. Cookies can make a Web site more useful by allowing the site to personalize information for visitors and by storing information about user preferences on a particular site so that the user does not have to re-enter information, etc., each time he or she returns to the site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major Web sites such as DriveTime.com use them to provide useful features for their customers. The cookie information does not include personal data such as name, age, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address.
      </p>
      <p>
      Most browsers are automatically set up to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set your browser to reject cookies. However, you might not be able to use certain features on the site.

      <p>
      <strong>Log Files</strong><br>
      DriveTime uses Google Analytics to analyze traffic to this Web site in order to help us understand our customers‚Äô and visitors' needs and to continually improve our site for them. The data they collect on our behalf may include search engine referral, affiliate referrals, traffic driven by banner ads or other online promotions, how visitors navigate around the site, and the most popular pages. We also collect certain technical information, such as the browser version and operating system. Google Analytics collects only anonymous, aggregate statistics. For example, we do not tie a specific visit to a specific IP address and we do not correlate this tracking with personally identifiable information.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Assistance to Victim of Identity Theft</strong><br>
      If you suspect that someone has had unauthorized access to your account with us or access to your personally identifiable information, you should report this crime to your local law enforcement agency and to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). To speak with a trained FTC telephone counselor, call toll-free 1-877-IDTheft (1-877-438-4338). Or, to enter information about your complaint into a secure FTC online database, visit <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/" target="_blank">www.consumer.gov/idtheft</a>. The site also provides links to consumer education materials.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Ways to Limit Direct Marketing You May Receive from Outside Sources</strong><br>
      There are outside agencies and companies that compile mailing lists for purchase by marketers. You may wish to have your name removed from many of these lists by following the procedures outlined below:
      </p>
      <ul>		<p>
      <strong>Direct Marketing Association and Member Companies</strong><br>
      To remove your name and direct mail or telemarketing lists of members of the Direct Marketing Association, send a written request with your name, address, and Social Security Number (if it was included in the mailing you received) to the Direct Marketing Association. The Direct Marketing Association is responsible for notifying its members (i.e., the agencies and companies that compile mailing lists) that you want your name removed from the lists they sell. Your name and address remains in their consumer exclusion files for five years.
      </p>
      <p>
      You must register yourself; they cannot process any request from us. You may visit their Web site at <a href="https://www.dmachoice.org" target="_blank">www.dmachoice.org</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Credit Reporting Agencies (Credit Bureaus)</strong><br>
      National consumer credit reporting agencies may also sell or share your name and certain other information to various outside companies for marketing purposes. You may direct these agencies not to do so by calling their toll-free telephone number at 1-888-567-8688 (1-888-OPTOUT)
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Federal ‚ÄúDo Not Call‚Äù Registry</strong><br>
      The FTC has implemented a Do Not Call Registry, effective October 1, 2003. To register for the Telemarketing Do Not Call list, visit the FTC‚Äôs Web site at <a href="http://www.donotcall.gov" target="_blank">www.donotcall.gov</a>.
      </p>
      </ul>
