<p><strong>Scope – What Does This Policy Cover?</strong><br>
This Privacy Policy applies only to your use of Our Site. It does not extend to any websites that are linked to from Our Site (whether We provide those links or whether they are shared by other users). We have no control over how your data is collected, stored or used by other websites and We advise you to check the privacy policies of any such websites before providing any data to them.</p>
<p><strong>1. The types of information we collect from you</strong><br>
There are two types of information that we collect about our users: personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“NPII”). Where the information is linked to your PII, that combined information is treated as PII.</p>
<p><strong>A. PII</strong> – refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are such as your name, address, email address, telephone, and other personal information.<br>
<strong>B. NPII</strong> – refers to information that does not in and of itself allow us to identify a specific individual such as your “log files” which tell us your IP address, which website your came from before ours or go to after, which browser you use, your browser language, the date and time of your requests, and the other similar activities. NPII may be analyzed and/or compiled on an aggregate or personal basis.</p>
<p><strong>2. When and what information we collect from you</strong><br>
We may collect information from you when you: visit our websites; download or use our products; request service or support; and pay for products and services.</p>
<p><strong>A. Website Use</strong> – AbeApps Pte Ltd. may collect information through the use of cookies, log files, web analytic tools, subscription sign ups, contact us forms, and other means of communication as may be made available on our websites.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong>– When you use our websites we may store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of our websites. A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer’s hard drive (if your web browser permits) that can be later retrieved to identify you to us. Our cookies consist of identification numbers only. We are able to look up information about your preferences, origin, and other information about you and your devices in order to save you time by eliminating the need to enter the same information repeatedly. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits. However, some parts of our websites may not work properly and some services may not be available if you decline to accept our cookies. If a third party ad serving company is used to display advertisements on our websites they may, as a part of their service, place a separate cookie on your computer. However, these companies will not be given any of your PII without your consent.</p>
<p><strong>Log Files</strong> – AbeApps Pte Ltd. maintains log files of the traffic that visits our websites. For example, our servers may automatically record the information you or your browser send when you visit a website. Those log files may include information such as your requests, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your requests, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your system.</p>
<p><strong>Web Analytics Tools</strong> – AbeApps Pte Ltd. or third parties we have contracted or sub-contracted may employ the use of website analytic tools. These tools help us understand and measure the effectiveness of our website and our advertising in various ways. For example, these tools may count the number of individuals who visit our website from a particular advertisement or who make a purchase from our website after viewing a particular advertisement or they may tell us when a web page is viewed and provide a description of the page where the tool is placed. To do so these tools may use a cookie or other tracking mechanism, or collect your IP address or user agent information (further defined below). You may be able to block this collection of information by denying cookies.</p>
<p><strong>Subscriptions</strong>– Our websites may make available news, offers, and information by subscription including emails, newsletters, and blogs. You may be asked for PII in relation to these subscriptions. The information you provide will be used to deliver the information you have requested through these subscriptions. We will not use this information for direct marketing purposes unless you agree also known as “opting in”. You are free to cancel your subscriptions at any time by clicking unsubscribe on the subscription or contacting us via the information provided herein.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Us Forms &amp; Communications</strong>– There are many opportunities to contact us via our websites. There may be links that allow you to reach us by email, by clicking a report button, by requesting online support services, live chat and other similar activities. We may collect information according to the nature of the reason you have contacted us. For example, your email address and name if you ask for support via email in order to reply, your telephone number if you request a call back, or we may ask you to allow remote access to the software and your computer files to assess a solution to a technical support request.</p>
<p><strong>Other</strong> – AbeApps Pte Ltd. may also collect PII when you input such information on other parts of our website. For example, if you begin to register and/or download a product on our website but do not complete the action, you may be sent reminder communications that your action was not complete. By your initiation of such actions and use of our website, you consent to receive such communications.</p>

<p><strong>Limited Functionality and/or Duration Products</strong> – Typically, we do not require you to register PII in order to download and use trial versions of our products for the applicable trial period. However, in some cases, particularly with full functionality trials, we may ask you to register PII before you can download and use the product. Later, when you download and run such products we may collect information such as your IP address and/or Media Access Control address, the Machine/Install ID of the computer on which the product is installed, preferred language, your user agent (information such as browser information, your operating system, plug-ins you have installed such as Flash, and computer type), devices you have attached to your computer, your hardware and software and have access to your entire system registry (which may include programs you have on your computer, user files, recent websites you have visited, browsing history, etc.) and other general statistical information.</p>

In any event, We will conduct an annual review to ascertain whether we need to keep your data. Your data will be deleted if we no longer need it in accordance with the terms of our Data Retention Policy. Our Data Retention Policies are:</p>
<p><strong>[Your data will only be stored within the European Economic Area (“the EEA”) (The EEA consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein).]</strong></p>
<p><strong>OR</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Some or all of your data may be stored or transferred outside of the European Economic Area (“the EEA”) (The EEA consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). You are deemed to accept and agree to this by using Our Site and submitting information to Us. If We do store or transfer data outside the EEA, We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated as safely and securely as it would be within the EEA and under the GDPR.

<p><strong>A. How our systems combine information and how we store, transfer, retain, and protect your information?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Systems</strong> – All PII is recorded in our ecommerce system and all NPII is stored in a separate tracking system. A user’s PII and NPII are linked by way of the fact that their information in both<br>
systems is categorized under the same unique identification number (UID). Due to the shared UID number in these systems, all information collected and stored in both systems is treated by AbeApps Pte Ltd. as PII. However, neither system is able to use nor automatically access the information stored in the other. Where the NPII collected is disassociated from the UID, the information collected is treated as<br>
NPII. Where such Mix Panel is a third party application utilized by AbeApps Pte Ltd. for the purpose of securely hosting Customer Relations Management (CRM). AbeApps Pte Ltd. analyzes data collected on an aggregate basis to optimize ecommerce flow and marketing campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Storage of Your Information</strong> – Information that we collect may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which we, our subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors, representatives, agents, or resellers maintain such information. PII on our servers is only accessible from our physical premises, premises of our subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors, representatives, agents and authenticated networks and personnel. Access is limited to authorized personnel only, and company networks are password protected and subject to additional policies and procedures for security. By your use of our product you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Data Transfer</strong> –Information may be transferred to the AbeApps Pte Ltd. group in the United States or other countries that may have less protective data protection laws than the region in which you are situated and be accessible by AbeApps Pte Ltd. employees or contractors exclusively to be used in accordance with the purposes outlined in this policy. For the same purposes the information may be shared with partners and vendors that process information on behalf of AbeApps Pte Ltd., including, for instance, banking and credit card partners to process payments made by you on our site. AbeApps Pte Ltd. has taken steps so that the collected information, if transferred, receives an adequate level of protection.</p>
<p><strong>Data Retention</strong> – In general, AbeApps Pte Ltd. will retain your PII for as long as you are a user of our products and thereafter for internal reporting and reconciliation purposes as necessitated by legal requirements and to provide you with any feedback or information you might request or require. After this time period we may delete orde-identify the information from our systems. Please note that if we remove your PII from our systems as described above, because we keep track of past transactions, we cannot delete information associated with those transactions. Additionally, it may be impossible to completely delete your information because of our data backup processes.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong> –We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the information we maintain and ensure it is used in accordance to the terms of this policy. Our security controls are designed to restrict access to the information to authorized personnel only. We test our website for security vulnerabilities. When you make payment on our websites using your credit card, we use SSL encryption in the transmission to AbeApps Pte Ltd. of the credit card number.</p>
