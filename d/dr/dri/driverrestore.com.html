This policy applies to information we obtain from individuals interacting with 383 Media, its websites, products, services, and applications, including without limitation online activities, phone contacts, offline contacts, and software reporting links (together referred to as “product”). This policy does not apply to information we obtain in our capacity as an employer.</p>
<p>This policy is available for your review through links on our websites, references in our end user license agreements and website terms and conditions, and incorporating it into other legal documents as necessary.</p>

<h3>1. The types of information we collect from you </h3>
<p>There are two types of information that we collect about our users: Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“NPII”). Where the information is linked to your PII, that combined information is treated as PII. </p>
<ul class="list-style">
<li>
  <b>A. PII – </b>refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are such as your name, address, email address, telephone, and other personal information. </li>
<li>
<b>B. NPII – </b>refers to information that does not in and of itself allow us to identify a specific individual such as your “log files” which tell us your IP address, which website your came from before ours or go to after, which browser you use, your browser language, the date and time of your requests, and the other similar activities. NPII may be analyzed and/or compiled on an aggregate or personal basis.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. When and what information we collect from you</h3>
<p>We may collect information from you when you: visit our websites; download or use our products; request service or support; and pay for products and services.</p>
<ul class="list-style">
<li>
<b>A. Website Use –</b> 383 Media may collect information through the use of cookies, log files, web analytic tools, subscription sign ups, contact us forms, and other means of communication as may be made available on our websites.<p></p>
<ul class="list-style">
<li>
<b>Cookies –</b> When you use our websites we may store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of our websites. A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer’s hard drive (if your web browser permits) that can be later retrieved to identify you to us. Our cookies consist of identification numbers only. We are able to look up information about your preferences, origin, and other information about you and your devices in order to save you time by eliminating the need to enter the same information repeatedly. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits. However, some parts of our websites may not work properly and some services may not be available if you decline to accept our cookies. If a third party ad serving company is used to display advertisements on our websites they may, as a part of their service, place a separate cookie on your computer. However, these companies will not be given any of your PII without your consent.</li>
<li>
<b>Log Files –</b>  383 Media maintains log files of the traffic that visits our websites. For example, our servers may automatically record the information you or your browser send when you visit a website. Those log files may include information such as your requests, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your requests, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your system.
</li>
<li>
<b>Web Analytics Tools –</b>  383 Media or third parties we have contracted or sub contracted may employ the use of website analytic tools. These tools help us understand and measure the effectiveness of our website and our advertising in various ways. For example, these tools may count the number of individuals who visit our website from a particular advertisement or who make a purchase from our website after viewing a particular advertisement or they may tell us when a web page is viewed and provide a description of the page where the tool is placed. To do so these tools may use a cookie or other tracking mechanism, or collect your IP address or user agent information (further defined below). You may be able to block this collection of information by denying cookies.</li>
<li>
<b>Subscriptions–</b>  Our websites may make available news, offers, and information by subscription including emails, newsletters, and blogs. You may be asked for PII in relation to these subscriptions. The information you provide will be used to deliver the information you have requested through these subscriptions. We will not use this information for direct marketing purposes unless you agree also known as “opting in”. You are free to cancel your subscriptions at any time by clicking unsubscribe on the subscription or contacting us via the information provided herein.</li>
<li>
<b>Contact Us Forms &amp; Communications–</b>  There are many opportunities to contact us via our websites. There may be links that allow you to reach us by email, by clicking a report button, by requesting online support services, live chat and other similar activities. We may collect information according to the nature of the reason you have contacted us. For example, your email address and name if you ask for support via email in order to reply, your telephone number if you request a call back, or we may ask you to allow remote access to the software and your computer files to assess a solution to a technical support request. </li>
<li>
<b>Other – </b>383 Media may also collect PII when you input such information on other parts of our website. For example, if you begin to register and/or download a product on our website but do not complete the action, you may be sent reminder communications that your action was not complete. By your initiation of such actions and use of our website, you consent to receive such communications.<p></p>
</li><li></li></ul>
</li>

<ul class="list-style">
<li>
<b>B. Download or Use our Products </b> – Dependent on whether the product is a free, trial, or purchased version, 383 Media may collect different types of information from you. The products may access such information through submission or processes initiated in the products by you or through internal automatic scanning and assessment functions and may submit collected data to 383 Media or its affiliates via internal automatic submission functions.<p></p>
<ul class="list-style">
<li>
<b>Limited Functionality and/or Duration Products – </b>Typically, we do not require you to register PII in order to download and use free or trial versions of our products for the applicable free or trial period. However, in some cases, particularly with full functionality trials, we may ask you to register PII before you can download and use the product. Later, when you download and run such products we may collect information such as your IP address and/or Media Access Control address, the Machine/Install ID of the computer on which the product is installed, preferred language, your user agent (information such as browser information, your operating system, plug-ins you have installed such as Flash, and computer type), devices you have attached to your computer, your hardware and software and have access to your entire system registry (which may include programs you have on your computer, user files, recent websites you have visited, browsing history, etc.) and other general statistical information.</li>
<li>
<b>Purchased Products –</b> Upon purchase of the product you will be asked to provide information such as your first and last name, email address, postal code, phone numbers, other contact information and your payment information to complete purchase of the product. Additionally, when you download and run such product we may collect information such as your IP address and/or Media Access Control address, the Machine/Install ID of the computer on which the product is installed, preferred languages, your user agent (information such as browser information, your operating system, plug-ins you have installed such as Flash, and computer type), devices you have attached to your computer, your hardware and software, status information about the installation or operation of the product, and have access to your entire registry (which may include programs you have on your computer, user files, recent websites you have visited, browsing history, etc.) and general statistical information. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="list-style">
<li>
<b>C. Request Service or Support –</b> We may collect PII and NPII from you in the course of providing our services or support. We may ask you to provide information about your computer, your internet access or service provider, IP address, information about your hardware and software, URLs of sites you have visited, files stored on your computer, and information about senders and receivers of email messages, and other similar NPII. We may request PII such as names, home or work address, email address, telephone number, or other information by which we may identify you. This information may be collected from you verbally, from your computer, or by way of electronic communication (including communication between your computer and ours, automated communications, and email). In your quest for support we may also offer you the option of allowing one of our agents to take remote control of your computer wherein that agent will have access to your entire system.
 </li>
</ul>
<h3>3. How we use your information</h3>
<p>Such information and access may be used depending on the product and to the extent permitted by law, including without limitation:  </p>
<ul class="list-style">
<li> – to deliver the services and support, or carry out, the transactions you have requested; </li>
<li> -to send communications to you, such as product safety information, your status (for example, order confirmation, registration status, license expiration), information about products and services available from 383 Media and its corporate affiliates, promotional offers and surveys; </li>
<li> -customize, analyze and improve our products, services (including the content and advertisements on our website), technologies, communications and relationship with you; </li>
<li> -enforce our conditions of sale, website terms and/or separate contracts (if applicable) with you; </li>
<li> -to track, analyze and publish reports on security risk trends using statistical information derived from the data<br>
prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities; </li>
<li> -protect the security or integrity of our websites, our business, or our products or services; or </li>
<li> -as otherwise reasonably necessary to ensure optimal product performance, meet your needs and/or requests, or as disclosed to you at the time of collection.</li>
<h3>4. How our systems combine information and how we store, transfer, retain, and protect your information </h3>
<ul class="list-style">
<li>
<b>Our Systems –</b> All PII is recorded in our ecommerce system and all NPII is stored in a separate tracking system.
