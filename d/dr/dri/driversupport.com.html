                <p><strong>Why Driver Support Collects Device Hardware and Software Inventory Information</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Driver Support collects your device’s hardware and software
                    inventory information in order to deliver our driver and other
                    device-associated recommendations, download access, and installation
                    automations provided in our software.&nbsp; The hardware and software
                    inventory data is essential for our software and servers to match the
                    best updates for a particular system on an ongoing basis.&nbsp; We
                    retain this information in order to continuously improve our matching
                    intelligence based on aggregating and normalizing the data collected
                    across all systems.
                </p>
                <p><strong>What Information We Collect</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Driver Support collects your Personal Information at a variety of
                    points, including when you place an order, (which may require you to
                    provide personal information, including a credit card number, to our
                    commerce providers) register software, request services or take part in
                    other activities on our Web site. For example, we often ask for your
                    Personal Information when you are conferring with one of our customer
                    support technicians, downloading a new product or program update,
                    registering your software or purchasing a product. During these
                    interactions we will collect Personal Information relevant to your
                    transacting with Driver Support, such as your name, mailing
                    address, e-mail address, shipping address and credit card information

                    own, such as the activation code or key code, date of purchase and
                    information relating to a support issue. We use this information for
                    billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing
                    an order, we will use this information to contact you. When you
                    register, you will be provided with an option to opt-out of receiving
                    promotional information on our products and services. We will not use
                    your personal information for anything other than what you have intended
                    it for. Please be aware that if you prefer not to provide us with your
                    Personal Information, because such information may be necessary for us
                    to provide certain services, we may not be able to, or may choose not
                    to, make such services available to you.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Device Hardware/Software Inventory and Performance Information</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The scanning technology present in our software is designed to collect all
                    hardware ID’s and software signatures present in the system and passes
                    this data back to our servers.&nbsp; We use this information so that our
                    servers can respond back to our software with a list of recommended
                    drivers and other software relevant to the discovered hardware.&nbsp;
                    Additional scanning technology present in our software is designed to collect cpu, memory, disk, network, and boot-time related data which is also passed back to our servers.&nbsp;We use this information so that our servers can respond back to our software with potential performance improvements that may be available to the user with the software.&nbsp;
                    While in trial-mode (pre-purchase) this information is not tied in any
                    way to any personal information.&nbsp; Post-purchase and after
                    activation of the software the inventory data is linked to your personal
                    information so that it can be shown as historical information in the
                    software, used as part of our free driver backup service, &nbsp;as well
                    as historical scan information available in your personalized <a href="https://secure.driversupport.com/account/">https://secure.driversupport.com/account/</a>
                    web portal (all features of our software and services).&nbsp; This
                    information is also used to handle any technical, product, or customer
                    support requests that you may send to us.&nbsp; Please be aware that if
                    you prefer not to provide this inventory information, our software will
                    be unable to provide any of our services.

                <p>
                    Driver Support is committed to protecting your privacy. Driver Support will not, under any circumstances, share, rent or
                    sell your Personal Information in ways other than as outlined in this
                    privacy policy nor does Driver Support trade or exchange
                    mailing lists with any other organization. Furthermore, Driver Support only shares your Personal Information with our contractors
                    that assist us in our efforts to fulfill our obligations to you, and

                    commitment as Driver Support to protect your privacy and data.
                    We use credit card processing companies to bill you for goods and
                    services, an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf and
                    a customer support provider to supply live assisted-support. These
                    companies do not retain share, store or use personally identifiable
                    information for any other purposes.

                <p>
                    Driver Support
                    maintains this information; but we reserve the right to disclose your

                    judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our
                    Website. If you require assistance, and would like someone to follow-up

                    wish to periodically receive promotional information, such as general

                    website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Customers are provided the option to opt-out within each
                    e-mail. If you no longer wish to receive Driver Support

                </p>
                <ul class="inside">
                    <li>By clicking on the auto-unsubscribe link included in each e-mail</li>
                    <li>By contacting our technical support department at support@driversupport.com</li>

                    efforts to store the Personal Information we collect in a secure
