<p>
Drinknation.com hates spam, and we especially dislike people who send spam.  We also dislike global warming and urban sprawl, and our favourite color is blue.  However, only the spam part is important.  We realize that you, like us, are hard working (ok, maybe you're not like us), honest individuals who have allergic reactions to unsolicited email and invasions of privacy.  So here's the run down of how we treat privacy here at Drinknation.
</p>
<h1 class="minor">What we do with our information</h1>

<ul class="agree">
<li> Drinknation.com (hereafter also referred to as "we" and "us") does not collect personal information for purposes other than to provide informational services to visitors to Drinknation.com's web site.  We DO NOT release any information we may collect about visitors to the Drinknation.com web site to advertisers, promotional agencies, private organizations, public organizations, angry mobs, your shady cousin Bob who no one has heard from in eight years, or third parties of any kind including companies and organizations that may work with us now or in the future.  Any personal information that Drinknation.com has will NEVER be seen by anyone other than employees of Drinknation.com for the purposes of providing a service to those individuals or organizations who have requested it, and for which the information is required to perform that service.  Personal information will NEVER be willfully released publicly or privately in any form, now or at any time in the future.</li>

<li> Any personal information Drinknation.com collects is stored in a secure database on private servers, to which no one other than employees of Drinknation.com have access to.  Drinknation.com is committed to keeping this information secure.</li>

<li> Any personal information that we may have about an individual is purely voluntary, and will never be collected
without the consent and knowledge of the individual.  If at any time an individual wishes to view, correct, or have deleted 
or destroyed the information Drinknation.com has about them, they may do so by sending a request via our <a href="/drinknation_comments.php">feedback form</a>, and we'll be happy to comply!  In most cases, Drinknation.com will endeavour to have an 
interactive process available for such functions (ie. subscribing and unsubscribing to newsletters).</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="minor">What we collect</h1>
Drinknation.com collects very limited information about our users. We don't know if you have glasses, purple hair or wear a fez... honest.
  In fact, there's no reason people not wearing pants can't have a go at this web site, it's that crazy.

<ul class="agree"> 
<li><h2>Registered Accounts</h2> - As of June 2004, registered accounts on Drinknation.com became available.  These accounts provide a number of useful features, such as quick links and secure data, that could not be provided otherwise.  Account registrations are available to anyone with a valid email address, and no other information is required.  No personal information is required to be collected or stored with a registered account.  For more information, see our <a href="/whyregister.php">benefits of registration</a> page.
