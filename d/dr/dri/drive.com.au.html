<p>
This policy applies to f2 Limited, f2 Australia &amp; New Zealand Pty Limited and Personal Investment Direct Access Pty Limited ("f2").   The policy explains how f2 uses personal information collected through the f2 Network. For more information on the sites that comprise the f2 Network, visit <a href="http://www.f2.com.au">www.f2.com.au</a>.
</p>

<p>
f2 is bound by the National Privacy Principles contained in the Commonwealth Privacy Act, except for its activities carried on in the course of journalism. f2 is exempt from complying with the Privacy Act in relation to its journalism activities.  f2 has publicly committed to complying with the <a href="http://www.presscouncil.org.au/pcsite/priv_stand.html">Australian Press Council Privacy Standards</a> for the use of personal information in the course of journalism.
</p>

<p>
f2 may, from time to time, review and update this privacy policy statement to take account of new laws and technology and changes to f2's operations.  All personal information held by f2 will be governed by f2's most recent policy, posted on the f2 Network.
</p>


<p><strong><a name="personal">What kind of personal information f2 collects and how it is collected</a></strong><br>
f2 collects personal information from a variety of sources, including from members of the public, advertisers, prospective employees, mailing lists, recruitment agencies, contractors and business partners.
</p>

<p>
In general, the personal information f2 collects includes (but is not limited to) name, address, contact details, gender, occupation, in some cases membership of professional associations and, where relevant, financial information, including credit card information, banking details and income information.
</p>

<p>
<i>Personal Information you provide</i>:  We store the personal information you enter on the f2 Network or give to f2 in other ways.  We obtain most personal information through the f2 Network membership registration process and updates to membership details.  You may provide information when you request or acquire a product or service from f2 or its related companies, provide a product or service to f2, complete a survey or questionnaire, enter a competition, participate in forums or when you communicate with f2 by e-mail, telephone or in writing (for example if you contact customer service or provide feedback).
</p>

<p>
<i>Automatic collection</i>: Cookies: We may use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign your computer a 'User ID'.  Cookies do not contain information by which f2 can identify you.  They identify your computer to our servers.  You may configure your browser so that you are notified before a cookie is downloaded or so that your browser does not accept cookies.   f2 may use information contained in cookies to make assumptions about the user of the computer and to provide users of that computer with focused advertising which f2 believes may be of interest, based on that information.  To disable your cookies, please refer to the help menu within your Internet browser.
</p>

<p>
<i>Indirect collection</i>: f2 endeavours to collect personal information about an individual only from that individual.  In some circumstances f2 may obtain personal information from a third party.  If you provide personal information about another person to f2, f2 requires that you inform that person you have done so and provide them with a copy of this policy.
</p>




<p><strong><a name="use">How f2 uses the information you provide</a></strong><br>
f2 may use information it collects from you for the primary purpose for which it is collected and for such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose of collection.
</p>

<p>
f2 generally uses personal information to:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>provide you with products or services you have requested</li>
	<li>personalise and customise your experiences on the f2 Network;</li>
	<li>help f2 manage and enhance its services;</li> 
	<li>communicate with you; </li>
	<li>provide you with ongoing information about opportunities on the f2 Network in which f2 believes you may be interested;</li>
	<li>give you the opportunity from time to time to receive e-mail and 'e-newsletters' from f2.</li> 
</ul>

<p>
In most cases where f2 asks you to provide information about yourself, if you do not provide f2 with that information, f2 will not be able to provide you with the requested product or service.
</p>



<p><strong><a name="disclosure">Disclosure</a></strong><br>
f2 may disclose personal information to other companies in the Fairfax Group which may only use it as set out above.
</p>

f2 may also provide your information to: 
<ul>
	<li>third parties engaged by f2 to perform functions on its behalf, such as processing credit card information, mailouts, debt collection, marketing, research and advertising;</li>
	<li>third parties authorised by you to receive information held by Fairfax;</li>
	<li>NGA.NET Pty Ltd but only for the purpose of NGA.NET hosting job applications and resumes that you submit via the MyCareer site.</li>
</ul>

<p>
f2 uses DoubleClick International Asia B.V. to deliver the e-mails and e-newsletters you may ask to receive.  DoubleClick International generally sends this data to the United States and Canada, but may transfer it to other countries where appropriate. By requesting an e-mail or e-newsletter from f2, you agree that Doubleclick may use your personal information in this way. If you would like to know more about the information gathering practices and 'opt-out' procedures of DoubleClick International, visit:<a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;">http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;</a>
</p>

<p>
f2 shares web site usage information about visitors to the f2 Network who have received a targeted promotional e-mail campaign, with DoubleClick International B.V. for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, f2 and its third-party advertising company will keep information on the email campaign and some of the pages you visit on the f2 Network through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs).  For more information about our advertising company, visit <a href="http://www.privacychoices.org">www.privacychoices.org</a>.  To opt out of the targeting program, please visit <a href="http://www.privacychoices.org/optout.htm">www.privacychoices.org/optout.htm</a>
</p>

<p>
If f2 sells part of its business, personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the purchaser.
</p>

<p>
The f2 Network contains features where you are invited to send personal information to organisations other than f2.  The choice to send such information to these organisations is entirely yours.  You should be aware that any such information you choose to send will not be bound by this policy.
</p>

<p><strong>OfferWatch</strong><br>
OfferWatch is a service which provides access to special offers about products or services you have opted-in to receive.  In order to gain access to Offerwatch, you must be a member of f2 and must supply f2 with personal information, including your name, e-mail address, gender, date of birth, postcode, country of residence and annual income. f2 will treat your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy. f2 may disclose aggregated statistical information which does not identify you personally to advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional, and other purposes.  You can correct or change the information collected during subscription to OfferWatch at any time by following the instructions in our "My Member Details" area.  If you experience problems or have questions about OfferWatch, email f2 at privacy@f2network.com.au. 
</p>

<p><strong><a name="sensitive">How f2 treats sensitive information</a></strong><br>
<b>"Sensitive Information"</b> means information relating to a person's racial or ethnic origin, membership of political bodies, religion, membership of a trade union or professional or trade association, sexual preferences, criminal record and health. 
</p>

<p>
f2 may use and disclose Sensitive Information only for the purpose for which it was provided or a directly related secondary purpose or as allowed by law unless you have agreed otherwise.
</p>

<p><strong><a name="management">Management and security of personal information</a></strong><br>
f2 has appointed a Privacy Officer to oversee f2's management of personal information in accordance with this policy and the Commonwealth Privacy Act.
</p>

<p>
f2 protects the personal information f2 holds from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure by various means including firewalls, pass word access, secure servers and encryption of credit card transactions.
</p>

<p><strong><a name="update">Updating personal information</a></strong><br>
f2 endeavours to ensure that the personal information it holds is accurate, complete and up-to-date.  You can update your f2 membership information via the 'Update your details' section on any of the sites within the f2 Network.
</p>

<p>
You can generally update personal information that is not membership information on the website of the f2 Network where you submitted that information.  Otherwise, please contact f2 on privacy@f2network.com.au. Where personal information is no longer required by f2, it will be destroyed or de-identified.
</p>


<p><strong><a name="rights">Seeking access to the personal information f2 holds about you</a></strong><br>
You have the right to seek access the personal information held about you and to advise f2 of any inaccuracy.  There are some exceptions to this right set out in the Privacy Act.
</p>

<p>
If you make an access request, f2 will ask you to verify your identity and specify what information you require.  f2 may charge a fee to cover the costs of meeting your request. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Membership information:</i>  f2 Network Members can access the membership information f2 holds about them at any time via the 'Update your details' section on any of the sites within the f2 Network.
