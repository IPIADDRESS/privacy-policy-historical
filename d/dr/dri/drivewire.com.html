<p><i><a name="1">1. What information does drivewire.com collect from you?</a></i><br>
In order to better provide you with numerous products and services, drivewire.com collects two types of information 
about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary 
goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while 
using our site. 

</p><p>Personally Identifiable Information
This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is requested when 
you order a product or service, register for a Gift List, enter contests or sweepstakes, fill out surveys, and 
send us feedback. This information might include your name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, 
e-mail address, credit card or other payment information, and product details. With this information, drivewire.com 
can fill your orders and better provide you with personalized services. 

</p><p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information
This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information 
about you based upon where you shop on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both 
a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") 
that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") 
address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an 
identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, 
such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP 
address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your 
computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers
 require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop. 


</p><p><i><a name="2">2. Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</a></i><br>
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide drivewire.com's visitors with a superior 
customized online experience. We use the customer contact information to fill orders, contact purchasers to 
inform them of their order status, to send promotional information, to enhance the operation of our site and
 administer our systems. 

</p><p>Limited demographic data is also collected at our site from our third party advertising server, who provides
 us with the zip code and area code associated with a visitor's server, along with pages viewed on our site. 
 We review the actions of the drivewire.com visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers' preferences. 
 drivewire.com does research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and pages viewed based on the information 
 provided to us during ordering, a promotion, from our server log files, from contests, drawings or surveys. 
 We will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, to improve our marketing and promotional 
 efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve our product offerings, and to customize our Site's content, 
 layout, and services. We receive summary, but not individual, reports from our third party ad server, which tells 
 us how many ads were presented and clicked upon. 

</p><p>We gather information in the following ways: 
 
</p><p><b>Online Surveys and Polling</b><br>
In order to improve our services to you, we ask some of our customers to voluntarily complete surveys, which may be 
collected by an independent third party. Individual survey answers are confidential, although Non-Personally 
Identifiable Information is collected and disclosed to third parties. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, 
simply decline to participate when asked. 

</p><p><b>Contests and Sweepstakes</b><br>
When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask you for contact information such as your name, address and 
e-mail address in order to administer the contest, to send you promotional e-mails, notify winners and make the 
winners' list publicly available pursuant to certain states' laws. Your consent to such promotional use and disclosure
 of this information is a condition of your participation. As a condition of receiving any prize, you will be required
  to submit an Affidavit of Eligibility, for us to ensure that you are eligible to receive the prize according to the
   Contest Rules. 

</p><p><b>Newsletters &amp; Promotional E-mails</b><br>
We offer free newsletters and promotional e-mails as a service to our customers. We will send you newsletters 
and e-mails periodically listing current specials and deals. To stop receiving our newsletter, send an e-mail

in a file specific to you. If you contact us through our feedback area or by calling one of our customer service 
representatives, we may ask for your name and e-mail address in order to send you a reply. If other users or third

we provide them with your order information. 


</p><p><i><a name="3">3. With whom do we share your information?</a></i><br>
The information collected by drivewire.com is used only for the limited purposes of processing orders, keeping you

provide customer service and deliver promotional e-mails to you from drivewire.com. For example, we must 
release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment; and release your address 
information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered.

 apply our Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property, and safety of drivewire.com, our users, 
 or others. 
 
</p><p>Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, at present drivewire.com does not disclose its customers' 
Personally Identifiable Information to other merchants. In the future, with your permission, we may provide 
some customer information to companies with products or services that may be of interest to you. This would be for 
marketing purposes only and no credit card information would be given. 
Occasionally drivewire.com may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally 
Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable 
Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. 
drivewire.com fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for 
illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good 
faith believe to be unlawful.

update your information if it changes.
