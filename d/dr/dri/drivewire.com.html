      <b><a name="1">1. What
        information does Drivewire.com collect from you?</a></b> <br>
      <br>
      In order to better provide
      you with numerous products and services, Drivewire.com collects two types of
      information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and
      Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting
      information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized
      experience while using our site. <br>
      <br>
      Personally Identifiable
      Information This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who
      you are. Personal information is requested when you order a product or service,
      register for a Gift List, enter contests or sweepstakes, fill out surveys, and
      send us feedback. This information might include your name, billing address,
      shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other payment
      information, and product details. With this information, Drivewire.com can fill
      your orders and better provide you with personalized services. <br>
      <br>
      Non-Personally
      Identifiable Information This refers to information that does not by itself
      identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based
      upon where you shop on our site in several ways. This information is compiled
      and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may
      include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just
      came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your
      Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of
      documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an
      identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
      Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks
      like the web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP
      address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is
      automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web,
      allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP
      addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop. <br>

      <b><a name="2">2. Where
        do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</a></b> <br>
      <br>
      Our primary goal in
      collecting personal information is to provide Drivewire.Com visitors with a
      superior customized online experience. We use the customer contact information
      to fill orders, contact purchasers to inform them of their order status, to
      send promotional information, to enhance the operation of our site and
      administer our systems. <br>
      <br>
      Limited demographic data
      is also collected at our site from our third party advertising server, who
      provides us with the zip code and area code associated with a visitor's server,
      along with pages viewed on our site. We review the actions of the Drivewire.com
      visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers' preferences.
      Drivewire.com does research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and pages
      viewed based on the information provided to us during ordering, a promotion, from
      our server log files, from contests, drawings or surveys. We will use this data
      to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, to improve our marketing and
      promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve our product
      offerings, and to customize our Site's content, layout, and services. We
      receive summary, but not individual, reports from our third party ad server,
      which tells us how many ads were presented and clicked upon. <br>
      <br>
      <b>We gather information
        in the following ways: </b> <br>
      <br>
      <b>Online
        Surveys and Polling<br>
      </b>In order to
      improve our services to you, we ask some of our customers to voluntarily
      complete surveys, which may be collected by an independent third party.
      Individual survey answers are confidential, although Non-Personally
      Identifiable Information is collected and disclosed to third parties. If you do
      not wish to participate in a survey, simply decline to participate when asked. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Contests and
        Sweepstakes<br>
      </b>When you enter a
      contest or other promotion, we may ask you for contact information such as your
      name, address and e-mail address in order to administer the contest, to send
      you promotional e-mails, notify winners and make the winners' list publicly
      available pursuant to certain states' laws. Your consent to such promotional
      use and disclosure of this information is a condition of your participation. As
      a condition of receiving any prize, you will be required to submit an Affidavit
      of Eligibility, for us to ensure that you are eligible to receive the prize
      according to the Contest Rules. <br>

      Identifiable Information to third parties to charge your credit card, fill your
      order, deliver your order, provide customer service and deliver promotional
      e-mails to you from Drivewire.com. For example, we must release your credit
      card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment; and release your
      address information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered. <br>
      <br>
      We do not sell, trade, or
      rent your personal information to others. We may provide Non-Personally
      Identifiable Information about our customers' sales, traffic patterns, and
      related site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not
      include any Personally Identifiable Information. We may release account
      information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to
      enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property,
      and safety of Drivewire.com, our users, or others. <br>
      <br>
      Except as otherwise stated
      in this Policy, at present Drivewire.com does not disclose its customers'
      Personally Identifiable Information to other merchants. In the future, with
      your permission, we may provide some customer information to companies with
      products or services that may be of interest to you. This would be for
      marketing purposes only and no credit card information would be given.
      Occasionally Drivewire.com may be required by law enforcement or judicial
      authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate
      governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information
      upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement
      investigation. Drivewire.com fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in
      identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the
      right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good
      faith believe to be unlawful. <br>
      <br>
      You will be notified when
      any third party that is not our agent/service provider collects your personal
      information, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share
      your information with that party. <br>
      <br>
      We reserve the right to
      disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when
      we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply
