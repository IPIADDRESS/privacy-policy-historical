<b><font color="#CC3300"><a name="1">1. What information does drivewire.com collect from you?</a></font></b><br>
</p><p>
In order to better provide you with numerous products and services, drivewire.com collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site. 
</p><p>
Personally Identifiable Information This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is requested when you order a product or service, register for a Gift List, enter contests or sweepstakes, fill out surveys, and send us feedback. This information might include your name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other payment information, and product details. With this information, drivewire.com can fill your orders and better provide you with personalized services. 
</p><p>
Non-Personally Identifiable Information This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you shop on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.

<b><font color="#CC3300"><a name="2">2. Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</a></font></b><br>
</p><p>

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide drivewire.com's visitors with a superior customized online experience. We use the customer contact information to fill orders, contact purchasers to inform them of their order status, to send promotional information, to enhance the operation of our site and administer our systems. 
</p><p>
Limited demographic data is also collected at our site from our third party advertising server, who provides us with the zip code and area code associated with a visitor's server, along with pages viewed on our site. We review the actions of the drivewire.com visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers' preferences. drivewire.com does research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and pages viewed based on the information provided to us during ordering, a promotion, from our server log files, from contests, drawings or surveys. We will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve our product offerings, and to customize our Site's content, layout, and services. We receive summary, but not individual, reports from our third party ad server, which tells us how many ads were presented and clicked upon. 
</p><p>
We gather information in the following ways: 

</p><blockquote>

<b>Online Surveys and Polling<br></b>
In order to improve our services to you, we ask some of our customers to voluntarily complete surveys, which may be collected by an independent third party. Individual survey answers are confidential, although Non-Personally Identifiable Information is collected and disclosed to third parties. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, simply decline to participate when asked. 
<p>
<b>Contests and Sweepstakes<br></b>
When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask you for contact information such as your name, address and e-mail address in order to administer the contest, to send you promotional e-mails, notify winners and make the winners' list publicly available pursuant to certain states' laws. Your consent to such promotional use and disclosure of this information is a condition of your participation. As a condition of receiving any prize, you will be required to submit an Affidavit of Eligibility, for us to ensure that you are eligible to receive the prize according to the Contest Rules. 
</p><p>
<b>Newsletters &amp; Promotional E-mails<br></b>
We offer free newsletters and promotional e-mails as a service to our customers. We will send you newsletters and e-mails periodically listing current specials and deals. 
</p><p>
<b>Cookies<br></b>
We use cookies in the operation of our site; to find out what cookies are and how we use them, click here. Contact Information and Third Party Data If you contact drivewire.com or our customer service representatives by telephone, e-mail or letter, we may keep a record of your correspondence or comments. If you report a problem with our site, we may collect such information in a file specific to you. If you contact us through our feedback area or by calling one of our customer service representatives, we may ask for your name and e-mail address in order to send you a reply. If other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or purchases on our site, we may keep the information in a file specific to you. We use a third party to help us provide customer service. In order to help you most effectively, we provide them with your order information.

<b><font color="#CC3300"><a name="3">3. With whom do we share your information?</a></font></b><br>
</p><p>

The information collected by drivewire.com is used only for the limited purposes of processing orders, keeping you informed about your order status, for statistical purposes, for improving our site and its performance, and to notify you of products or special offers that may be of interest to you. We will disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties to charge your credit card, fill your order, deliver your order, provide customer service and deliver promotional e-mails to you from drivewire.com. For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment; and release your address information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered. 
</p><p>
We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We may provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers' sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information. We may release account information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property, and safety of drivewire.com, our users, or others. 
</p><p>
Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, at present drivewire.com does not disclose its customers' Personally Identifiable Information to other merchants. In the future, with your permission, we may provide some customer information to companies with products or services that may be of interest to you. This would be for marketing purposes only and no credit card information would be given. Occasionally drivewire.com may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. drivewire.com fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
