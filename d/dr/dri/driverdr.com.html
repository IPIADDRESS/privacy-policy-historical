Why DriverDR (Driver Doctor) Collects Personal Information
</span>
</p>
<br>
<p>
DriverDR (Driver Doctor) only collects your Personal Information where it is required to provide you the best services and products available. By maintaining an accurate customer database, we are able to send notifications via e-mail to keep you informed about the status of your orders or accounts and to provide updates and technical notices. These messages are essential to the maintenance of your subscription and the functionality of our products and services.

Why DriverDR (Driver Doctor) Collects Device Hardware and Software Inventory Information
</span>
</p>
<br>
<p>
DriverDR (Driver Doctor) collects your device’s hardware and software inventory information in order to deliver our driver and other device-associated recommendations, download access, and installation automations provided in our software. The hardware and software inventory data is essential for our software and servers to match the best updates for a particular system on an ongoing basis. We retain this information in order to continuously improve our matching intelligence based on aggregating and normalizing the data collected across all systems.
</p><p>
<br>
<span>
What Information We Collect
</span>
</p><p>
<br>
<strong>Personal Information</strong>
<br>
</p><p>
DriverDR (Driver Doctor) collects your Personal Information at a variety of points, including when you place an order, (which may require you to provide personal information, including a credit card number, to our commerce providers) register software, request services or take part in other activities on our Web site. For example, we often ask for your Personal Information when you are conferring with one of our customer support technicians, downloading a new product or program update, registering your software or purchasing a product. During these interactions we will collect Personal Information relevant to your transacting with DriverDR, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, shipping address and credit card information along with information about the DriverDR products you own, such as the activation code or key code, date of purchase and information relating to a support issue. We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. When you register, you will be provided with an option to opt-out of receiving promotional information on our products and services. We will not use your personal information for anything other than what you have intended it for. Please be aware that if you prefer not to provide us with your Personal Information, because such information may be necessary for us to provide certain services, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, make such services available to you.
</p><p>
<br>
<strong>Device Hardware and Software Inventory Information</strong>
<br>
</p><p>
The scanning technology present in our software is designed to collect all hardware ID’s and software signatures present in the system and passes this data back to our servers. We use this information so that our servers can respond back to our software with a list of recommended drivers and other software relevant to the discovered hardware. While in trial-mode (pre-purchase) this information is not tied in any way to any personal information. Post-purchase and after activation of the software the inventory data is linked to your personal information so that it can be shown as historical information in the software, used as part of our free driver backup service, as well as historical scan information available in your personalized web portal (all features of our software and services). This information is also used to handle any technical, product, or customer support requests that you may send to us. Please be aware that if you prefer not to provide this inventory information, our software will be unable to provide any of our services.
