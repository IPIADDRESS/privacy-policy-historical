	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
	
	<p>This privacy policy was last modified on 15th august 2008</p>

	<p><a href="#updates">RECENT UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</a></p>

	<p>DrivingSales, Inc. ("Company," "we," or "us")
	knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. This Privacy
	Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by Company when you
	use drivingsales.com and related services (the “Service”), how the information
	will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or
	deletion of information. We will not use or share your information with anyone
	except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

	<h3>Information We Collect</h3>

	<p><b>User-Provided Information:</b> You provide us information about yourself,
	such as your name and e-mail address, when you register with the Service. If
	you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email
	messages, your email address and our responses.</p>

	<p><b>Cookies Information:</b> When you visit drivingsales.com, we may send one
	or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric
	characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets
	Company help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A
	cookie does not collect personal information about you. Company uses both
	session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your
	hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your
	browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by
	following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and
	disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to
	refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some
	features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept
	cookies is disabled.</p>

	<p><b>Log File Information:</b> Log file information is automatically reported
	by your browser each time you access a web page. When you register with or view
	our site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web
	browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include
	information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP")
	address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks,
	domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>

	<p><b>Clear Gifs Information:</b> When you use the Service, we may employ clear
	gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of
	our users anonymously. No personally identifiable information from your Company
	account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear
	gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by
	recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve
	the effectiveness of our marketing, and make Company better for our users.</p>

	<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>

	<p>We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide
	to you the features and functionality of the Service. </p>

	<p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for
	posting to the Service (for instance, in User Content you post) becomes
	available to the public. If you remove User Content, copies may remain viewable
	in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your User
	Content.</p>

	<p>By providing Company your email address you consent to our using the email
	address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law,
	in lieu of communication by postal mail. You may not opt out of Service-related
	e-mails. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as
	newsletters, changes to features of the Service, or special offers. If you do
	not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by sending an email
	message to <a href="mailto:support@drivingsales.com">support@drivingsales.com</a>
	with the words "No email" in the subject field. Opting out may
	prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or
	offers. </p>

	<p>Company may use certain information about you and/or your User Content
	without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for
	purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or
	technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing advertisements and
	promotions. </p>

	<p>Company reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the User
	Content you post on the site. Company has the right to remove any such
	information or material for any reason or no reason, including without
	limitation, if in its sole opinion, such information or material violates, or
	may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Use Agreement or to protect or
	defend its rights or property or those of any third party. Company also
	reserves the right to remove information upon the request of any third party.</p>

	<p>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember
	information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the
	next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and
	information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our service; (d) monitor
	aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose or
	fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated
	with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP; and (f) help
	you efficiently access your information after you sign in.</p>

	<h3>How We Share Your Information</h3>

	<p><b>Personally Identifiable Information:</b> Company will not rent or sell
	your personally identifiable information to others. Company may share your
	personally identifiable information with third parties for the purpose of
	providing services to you. If we do this, such third parties’ use of your
	information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal
	information in locations outside the direct control of Company (for instance,
	on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>

	<p>You may elect to share your personal information (or authorize Company to do
	so) with other users of the Service.&nbsp; In such event, Company maintains no
	further control over and accepts no liability for how such personal information
	is used.</p>

	<p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings.
	Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred
	business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such
	information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution. </p>

	<p>Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, Company will not
	disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by
	law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform
	to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or
	investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal
	activities; (b) to enforce our <a href="http://www.drivingsales.com/termsofuse.php">Terms of Use</a>, take
	precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any
	third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies,
	or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or
	protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Company, our users or
	others.</p>

	<p><b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</b> We may share non-personally
	identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages
	and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties
	to help them understand the usage patterns for certain Company services.</p>

	<p>Company allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad
	networks, to serve advertisements on the Company site. These third-party ad
	servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the
	advertisements and links that appear on the site. They automatically receive
	your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such
	as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements
	and to personalize the advertising content.</p>

	<p>Company does not provide any personally identifiable information to these
	third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please
	note that if an advertiser asks Company to show an advertisement to a certain
	audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may
	conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
	</p>

	<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad
	servers or ad networks. The Company privacy policy does not apply to, and we
	cannot control the activities of, such advertisers. </p>

	<h3>How We Protect Your Information</h3>

	<p>Company uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical
	safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.
	We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you
	transmit to Company and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your
	transmission of information, Company makes commercially reasonable efforts to
	ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a
	guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or
	destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial
	safeguards. </p>

	<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as
	requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you
	access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your
	unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your
	email communications from Company, at all times.</p>

	<h3>Compromise of Personal Information</h3>

	<p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a
	breach of security, Company will promptly notify those persons whose personal
	information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification
	procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by
	applicable law.</p>

	<h3>Your Choices About Your Information</h3>

	<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information
	through the site, in which case Company may not be able to provide certain
	services to you. You may update or correct your account information and email
	preferences at any time by logging in to your account. You can review and
	correct the information about you that Company keeps on file by contacting us
	directly at <a href="mailto:support@drivingsales.com">support@drivingsales.com</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

	<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that
	reason, Company does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from
	anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you
	are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us,
	including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under
	age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Company. In the
	event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child
	under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that
	information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any
	information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@drivingsales.com">privacy@drivingsales.com</a>.</p>

	<h3>Links to Other Web Sites</h3>

	<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or
	from our Web site nor the information or content contained therein. Please
	remember that when you use a link to go from our Web site to another Web site,
	our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any
	other Web site, including those that have a link on our Web site, is subject to
	that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and
	policies before proceeding.</p>

	<h3>Notification Procedures</h3>

	<p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are
	required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you
	via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting
	of such notice on our Website page, as determined by Company in its sole
	discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing
	notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of
	notification as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

	<h3>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>

	<p>If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes
	on our website to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it
	and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy
	are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

	site, or your dealings with this Web site, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@drivingsales.com">privacy@drivingsales.com</a>, or send
