					We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website  visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal  information .  
					<p>(1) <strong>What information do we collect?</strong> We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:   <br>
					(a)information about your visits to and use of this website ; <br>
					(b) information about any transactions carried out between you and us  on or in relation to this website, including information relating to  any purchases you make of our goods or services; <br>
					(c)information that you provide to us for the purpose of registering  with us and/or subscribing to our website services and/or email  notifications; </p>
					<p>(2)<strong>Information about website visits</strong> We may collect information about you computer and your visits to this  website such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type,  referral source, length of visit and number of page views. We may use  this information in the administration of this website, to improve the  website's usability, and for marketing purposes. We use cookies on this  website. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser,  and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the  server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This  enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. We may  send a cookie which may be stored on by your browser on your computer's  hard drive. We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the  administration of this website, to improve the website's usability and  for marketing purposes. We may also use that information to recognise  your computer when you visit our website, and to personalise our  website for you. Our advertisers and payment processor may also send  you cookies. Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For  example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookie by clicking  “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all  cookies” using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a  negative impact upon the usability of many websites. </p>
					<p>(3)<strong>Using your personal data</strong> Personal data submitted on this website will be used for the purposes  specified in this privacy policy or in relevant parts of the website.  In addition to the uses identified elsewhere in this privacy policy, we  may use your personal information to  : <br>
					(a)improve your browsing experience by personalizing the website ; <br>
					(b)send information (other than marketing communications) to you which  we think may be of interest to you by post or by email or similar  technology; We will not without your express consent provide your  personal information to any third parties for the purpose of direct  marketing . </p>
					<p>(4)<strong>Other disclosures</strong> In addition to the disclosures reasonably necessary for the purposes  identified elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may disclose  information about you : <br>
					(a) to the extent that we are required to do so by law; <br>
					(b)in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings ; <br>
					(c)in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights  (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud  prevention and reducing credit risk); and  <br>
					(d)to the purchaser or seller (or prospective purchaser or seller) of  any business or asset which we are (or are contemplating) selling or  purchasing. Except as provided in this privacy policy, we will not  provide your information to third parties . </p>
					<p>(5)<strong>International data transfers</strong> Information that we collect may be stored and processed in and  transferred between any of the countries in which we operate in order  to enable us to use the information in accordance with this privacy  policy. If you are in the European Union, information which you provide  may be transferred to countries (including the United States) which do  not have data protection laws equivalent to those in force in the  European Union. You expressly agree to such transfers . </p>
					<p>(6)<strong>Security of your personal data</strong> We will take reasonable precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or  alteration of your personal information. Of course, data transmission  over the internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the  security of data sent over the internet. You are responsible for  keeping any receipt and/or serial numbers confidential . </p>
					<p>(7)<strong>Policy amendments</strong> We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time by posting a new  version on our website. You should check this page occasionally to  ensure you are happy with any changes . </p>
					<p>(8)<strong>Third party websites</strong> The website contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of third party websites . </p>
