<b><u>TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT MAY BE COLLECTED</u></b><br><br>
<p>
	The following are the types of information we may collect:
</p>
<p>
	<a name="2"></a>
	<b>Web Site Usage Information &amp; Device Identifiers</b>
</p>
<p>
	We may receive and store certain types of web site usage information whenever you visit or interact with the Web Site. For example, we may collect the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other similar information. We may also collect your IP address or some other unique identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable (collectively referred to herein as a "Device Identifier"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, your cell phone, or other device used to access the Internet, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. We may associate your Device Identifier with the personal information you provide.  When analyzed, web site usage information helps us determine how visitors arrive at the Web Site, what type of content is most popular, what type of content you may find most relevant and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising.
</p>
<p>

	A.	We may receive information about you from other sources; for example, we may obtain geographic or  demographic information, or information regarding your possible interests, from third parties, or we may receive information from a marketing partner in connection with a co-branded web site or promotion. We may use this information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you and to tailor content and ads we serve to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Web Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personal information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed by us at the time you provide your personal information
</p>
<p>
	<a name="4"></a>
	<b>Information from Other Sources</b>
</p>
<p>
	We may ask you to provide us with two types of information: (1) personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, e-mail address, cell phone number and physical address; and (2) demographic information, such as gender, zip code, information regarding your education or number of children, or similar information. We may collect this information at various places and forms on the Web Site, including registration forms for newsletters and other communications (e.g., whether by e-mail, mobile device, etc.); when you communicate or otherwise interact with us, when you request show tickets; when you submit information to us (whether or not the information is intended to be posted on the Web Site); when you enter or participate in contests or sweepstakes, surveys or voting; or when you purchase a product or service through the Web Site.  You may also be asked to choose a user name and password in order to identify yourself during future visits to the Web Site.  Do not use your real name or the name of any other actual person as your user name.

<b><u>THIRD-PARTY AD SERVING &amp; AUDIENCE AND TRAFFIC MEASUREMENT SERVICES</u></b><br><br>
<p>
	The Web Site may use third party network advertisers to serve advertisements on the Web Site and may use a traffic measurement service to analyze traffic on the Web Site.  Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the Web Site and other web sites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Although advertisers and other companies do not have access to cookies set by the Web Site, the Web Site's third party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser or they may otherwise have access to non-personal information. These third party cookies are set to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies and web beacons are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. While we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the Web Site, you may wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, which provides information regarding the "opt-out" procedures of certain third party ad servers we may use.
