<div align="left">DSW collects customer information
to enhance your shopping experience. This privacy policy is intended to
assist you in understanding what information we gather about you when
you visit one of our stores or our websites, how we use and share that
information, and the safeguards we have in place for that information.
This Privacy Statement applies to the information collected at any of

WE COLLECT</div>
<div class="questions" align="left">
1. General Browsing Information<br><br>
dsw.com gathers navigational information during each visitor’s use of
our website. In the process of gathering navigational information,
non-personally identifiable information (i.e. domain type, browser
version, service provider and IP address) may be collected. The
navigational information tells dsw.com about the use of our website by
visitors, including the areas of our site that are most visited or the
time of a last visit to a page on our site. It also tells us about the
technical efficiencies of our website and services (i.e. the time it
takes a visitor to connect to our website or download pages). The
navigational information helps us better understand a visitor’s
experience at dsw.com and improve upon that experience by recognizing
and delivering more of the features, services and products our visitors
prefer.<br><br>
2. Personal Information<br><br>
DSW may ask you to provide personal information when you establish or
update a dsw.com account, sign up for the DSW Rewards program or manage
your Rewards account, create a wish list, sign up for or manage your text alerts, place an in-store order, enter a contest or sweepstakes,
participate in a survey, shop online, check the status of an order or
review order history, provide a review about our products, purchase and
send a gift card or eGift Card, search for products on our site or
provide information about your shoe preferences.<br><br>
Categories of information collected include name, address, email
address, recipient’s name and email address, DSW Rewards number (which
can be associated with the personal information you provided when you
signed up for DSW Rewards or when you update the account), order
information, telephone number, credit card information, birth month and
day, your review of our products, saved searches, preferred brands,
messages or reminders you create.
</div>
<br>
<div class="csSectionHeader">
<a name="PersonalInformation" id="PersonalInformation"></a>OUR USE OF
PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</div>
<div class="questions" align="left">
DSW uses the personal information we collect from you in stores
or online at dsw.com for the following purposes:
<ul type="disc">
<li>to deliver products that you have ordered, fulfill requests
that you have created, and process your return or exchange;</li>
<li>to understand your needs and preferences, possibly through
surveys, product evaluations or cookies;</li>
<li>to develop, market and sell products and services to you and
to tailor your experience on the dsw.com website to your interests;</li>
<li>to contact you or the product recipient(s) in the event of
order or delivery difficulties;</li>
<li>to manage and develop DSW’s business and operations,
administer accounts, collect and process payments;</li>
<li>to respond to your inquiries;&nbsp;</li>
<li>to send our DSW Rewards members updates about the Rewards
program, their rewards, and our products, promotions and events; and</li>
<li>to deliver information through the various communication
channels you have provided to us about our products or website,
including adding you to a DSW email list or to our customer phone and
mail marketing list when you register for an account, sign up for DSW
Rewards or make a purchase.</li>
</ul>
<br>
If you create or modify a dsw.com account you may save personal
information in that account, such as name, shipping and billing
addresses, and credit card information, and we will access this saved
information to make your shopping quicker and easier. We also require
you to create and/or access your account to use various services on the
website, including creating a product review. Because you must create
or access your dsw.com account prior to creating a review, it is
possible that we could associate you with the review you provide.
Information you include in a product review may be used by us to
enhance and personalize our product offerings to you.<br><br>
If at any time you would like to stop future delivery of promotional
email (including DSW Rewards and wish list), please follow the removal instructions
located at the bottom of each message. Asking us to stop delivery of
future promotional email will not prevent you from receiving email
communications relating to any online order you place at dsw.com,
requests to participate in surveys about our products&nbsp; other
operational email communications or emails forwarded to you by a friend
that tell you about our products.</div>
<br>
<div class="csSectionHeader">
<a name="ThirdParties" id="ThirdParties"></a>INFORMATION WE SHARE WITH
THIRD PARTIES</div>
<div class="questions" align="left">We use third parties to help
us provide services to you such as fulfilling orders, processing
payments, monitoring online activity at dsw.com, conducting surveys,
maintaining our database, taking and processing gift card and eGift
Card orders, administering emails, and administering drawings or
contests. Third parties also provide aggregate, comparative information
on the performance of our site to us and a select group.<br>
<br>
If, after making a purchase at dsw.com, you choose to participate in a
survey or review you will be providing it to a third party whom we use
to process the product reviews. Product reviews that comply with the
review rules noted may be published on this website, and some may be
published through other communication channels, including, but not
limited to emails, television and catalogs. Published reviews may
identify the author’s review nickname and location or designate the
reviewer as a Rewards member or rate the reviewer. <br>
<br>
If you make a purchase on our website, create or modify an account,
sign up for DSW Rewards or modify your Rewards account after 4/7/2008,
your name, mailing address, phone number or purchase information may be
made available to other companies who may provide you with information
about their products or services. <br>
<br>
Email addresses collected in stores or on this website will be shared
with third party service providers. If you provide your email address
to us after 4/7/2008 (including updating your email information),
provided you have not opted out of receiving marketing emails from us,
your email address may also be shared with other companies, so that
those businesses may send you information about their products. <br>
<br>
In addition, DSW may participate with certain unrelated companies who
will link you to our website, which may include recognition of
purchases from dsw.com. dsw.com may share personally identifiable
information we collect from you with the company linking to our
website. dsw.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of the
companies providing these links and we encourage you to review the
privacy policy of each of these companies. <br>
<br>
You should be aware that we may disclose specific information about you
if necessary to do so by law or based on our good faith belief that it
is necessary to enforce or apply our <a href="/dsw_shoes/customer_service/terms_and_conditions.jsp">Site
Use Terms &amp; Conditions of Use</a>, conform or comply with the law or is
necessary to protect DSW, the users of our website or others.<br>
<br>
If DSW were ever merged with, acquired by or acquires another business
entity, some or all of the personal information collected about you
would be shared with this entity, as well as retained by DSW.</div>

<div class="questions" align="left"><strong>1. What are
cookies and how do we use cookies on our website?</strong>
<p align="left">dsw.com uses a browser feature known as a cookie. A
cookie is a data file that is stored by your Web browser on your
computer. Cookies are used to help track your clicks and pass
information as you navigate dsw.com. This allows dsw.com to make our
site more responsive to your needs by delivering a better and more
personalized experience to you. We also use a technology known as clear
gifs, which are typically stored in emails to help us confirm your
receipt of, and response to, our emails and provide you a more
personalized experience with us. dsw.com also uses cookies to keep
track of how many items you put into your shopping bag and to remember
you when you return to dsw.com. Cookies can allow us to associate
navigational information from browsing visits with personal information
you provide at our site.</p>
<strong>2. Do we share information from cookies with third
parties?</strong>
<p align="left">We may share non-transactional behavioral data
collected through the use of cookies after 4/7/2008 with other
businesses</p>
<strong>3. How do third parties use cookies on our site?</strong>
<p align="left">We carefully select third party advertising
companies and allow them to collect non-personally identifiable
information by placing cookies when you choose to visit them and when
you visit dsw.com. These selected companies may use information (not
including your name, address, credit card information, email address,
or telephone number) about your choice to visit and your visits to our
site and other websites to provide advertisements about DSW products
and services on this and other websites. These selected companies also
provide this information to us which we use to gauge the effectiveness
of the advertisements they place about our products and services and
for marketing purposes. If you would like more information about this
practice and to know your choices about no longer having information
from these third party cookies used by these companies or provided to
us, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click
here</a>.</p>
<p align="left">We have also selected companies that will assist us
in better understanding your use of our site. These companies will
place cookies on your computer upon a visit to our site to collect
information on our behalf and may also make use of web bugs. These
companies will use both third party and first party cookies. Blocking
cookies served from third party domains will not block the first party
cookies. The information these companies collect educates us on such
things as search engine referral, how you navigate around our site,
traffic driven by banner ads, responses to email, unique visitor
identification, and product browsing and purchasing information, and
allows us to better serve your interests and provide you with more
personalized product offerings. dsw.com does not allow these companies
to collect credit card, username or password information. The
information collected on our behalf is analyzed and returned to
dsw.com. Other than possibly allowing use of collected data on an
aggregate basis, the companies providing these services are required to
maintain all information collected and the analysis of this information
in confidence. As a visitor to dsw.com, you have the option to
deactivate the ability of these companies to analyze your browsing and
purchasing behavior on our site. You may also choose to continue to
benefit from the improved shopping experience which this analysis
allows us to provide to you. Since this opt-out relies on cookies, if
you delete your cookies, you will need to opt-out again. To learn more
about the various levels of privacy and confidentiality you can select
with respect to these companies and to exercise your choice, <a href="" onclick="javascript:popPrivacy();return(false);">click here</a>.</p>
