        <p>DSLExtreme is committed to protecting the privacy and security of
          the information provided by customers visiting our Web site or using
          our services. DSLExtreme may request information from people visiting
          our Web sites or using our services. DSLExtreme is the sole owner of
          the information collected. <strong>DSLExtreme respects your privacy
          and will not knowingly distribute or cause to be distributed your personal
          information to any entity for any reason.</strong> We will not collect
          any personally identifiable information unless the visitor/customer
          provides it to us voluntarily. Personally identifiable information
          includes a visitors/customer’s name, address, telephone number
          and e-mail address. DSLExtreme is dedicated to building a long-term
          relationship with all of our customers and visitors. We will not sell,
          share or rent this information to others in ways other than as disclosed
          in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Prequalification and Service Quotes:</strong> In some cases,
          a visitor may be required to complete a prequalification or inquiry
          form to order a product or to receive certain information. During the
          registration process, the visitor is required to give specific information
          such as name and e-mail address, mailing address, location and phone
          number. This information is used to pre-qualify and contact the visitor
          regarding services offered by DSLExtreme for which the visitor has
          expressed interest. </p>
        <p><strong>Ordering:</strong> When taking orders online, DSLExtreme will
          request certain information from a customer to complete an order. The
          customer's information will include name, address, telephone number,
          e-mail address, payment information and other information as may be
          requested by DSLExtreme in the order form. This information is used
          for billing purposes, fulfillment of orders, ongoing account maintenance
          and upgrades. </p>
        <p><strong>Security:</strong> When customers are asked to enter certain
          sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security
          number), that information is encrypted and is protected through a Secure
          Socket Layer (SSL). SSL negotiates and employs the essential functions
          of mutual authentication, data encryption and data integrity for secure
          transactions. While on a secure page, such as an order form, the lock
          icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer® and
          Netscape Navigator® becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or
          open, when you are viewing other Web sites. </p>
        <p>All customer/visitor information, not just the sensitive information
          mentioned above, is restricted to DSLExtreme developers, network operations
          personnel and other qualified employees (such as billing clerks or
          customer care representatives). Finally, the servers on which DSLExtreme
          stores personally identifiable information are kept in a secure location. </p>
        <p><strong>Cookies:</strong> A "Cookie" is a piece of information
          that is sent from a DSLExtreme Web server to a visitor's browser and
          stored on the visitor's hard drive. DSLExtreme uses Cookies when a
          visitor orders a product or registers for a specific program. The Cookie
          stores information that allows DSLExtreme Web sites to remember a visitor
          the next time he or she visits a particular DSLExtreme Web site. Cookies
          also allow us to tailor our Web sites to better match visitors' interests
          and preferences. Visitors may choose to disable Cookies by changing
          their browser settings; however, they may not be able to access some
          of the information on our Web sites. </p>
        <p><strong>Links:</strong> DSLExtreme Web sites contain links to other
          Web sites. DSLExtreme is not responsible for the privacy practices
          of these Web sites. We encourage our visitors and customers to read
          the privacy policy of each Web site they visit. This Privacy Policy
          applies solely to information collected on DSLExtreme Web sites.</p>
        <p><strong>Sharing:</strong> DSLExtreme may partner with other parties
          to provide specific services, such as billing solutions, which are
          designed to enhance the functionality of our products and services.
          When a customer signs up for these services, DSLExtreme will only share
          names or other contact information that is necessary for the third
          party to provide these services. </p>
        <p><strong>Special Cases:</strong> It is DSLExtreme’s policy not
          to use or share the personal information about visitors or customers
          in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing
          you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated
          uses. However, DSLExtreme may disclose personal information about visitors
          or customers, or information regarding your use of the Services or
          Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our
          sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including:
          to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act,
          regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information;
          to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or
          bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable
          Use Policy or other user policies; to operate the services properly;
          or to protect DSLExtreme and our customers.</p>
        <p><strong>Correction/Updating Personal Information:</strong> If a customer
          needs to update or change personal identification information, DSLExtreme
          will help the customer to correct, update or remove personal data provided
          to DSLExtreme. The customer can update or change personally identifiable
          information using the Account Manager on our website <a href="http://www.dslextreme.com/access/">http://www.dslextreme.com/access/</a> or
          by contacting our customer service department at 800-774-3379.</p>
        <p><strong>Responses to Email Inquiries:</strong> When Visitors or Members
          send email inquiries to DSLExtreme, the return email address is used
          to answer the email inquiry we receive. DSLExtreme does not use the
          return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return
          email address with any third party.</p>
        <p><strong>Notification of Changes:</strong> If we make any changes to
          the DSLExtreme Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on DSLExtreme
          Web sites so customers/visitors are informed. We will always use information
          in accordance with the DSLExtreme Privacy Policy. </p>
        <p><strong>Questions: </strong>Any questions or comments regarding privacy
