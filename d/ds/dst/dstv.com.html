                    <li> MultiChoice Africa ("MultiChoice") believes in protecting the personal information it collects from individuals that access or use ("users") the website situated at http://www.dstv.com ("the DStv website"). </li>
                    <li> By accessing the DStv website, users agree to be bound by the privacy policy effective at the time of such access. This privacy policy forms part of the MultiChoice website <a href="terms_conditions.aspx" target="_self">terms and conditions.</a> </li>
                    <li> MultiChoice reserves the right in its sole discretion to amend this privacy policy from time to time.  In this event, MultiChoice will post the revised policy on the DStv website.  Each time a user accesses the DStv website, the user agrees to be bound by the policy posted on the DStv website at the time. </li>
                    <li> MultiChoice will take all reasonable steps to use or disclose users' personal information only in the manner allowed by this policy. </li>
                    <li> In clauses 14, 15 and 22 "MultiChoice" includes companies in the Naspers/MIH Group of companies ("MultiChoice's affiliates"). </li>
                    <p><strong>Personal information</strong> </p>
                    <li> Personal information refers to all private information about an identifiable individual, such as a user's name, contact details, identity number,  income levels, age, personal views and preferences.</li>
                    <p><strong>Active collection of personal information </strong> </p>
                    <li> The DStv website actively collects personal information from users by asking users specific questions and by permitting users to communicate directly with MultiChoice, for example via e-mail, feedback forms, forums and/or chat rooms. </li>
                    <li> Some areas of this site may also require the user to submit information in order for the user to register for certain services or benefit from specified features (for example newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers, payment processing) or to participate in a particular activity (such as competitions or other promotions, an example being the "Sign Me In" function) (collectively referred to as the "value added services"). </li>
                    <li> In these situations, MultiChoice will ask the user for particular information, and inform the user at each information point what information is required and what information is optional.</li>
                    <p><strong>Passive collection of personal information</strong> </p>
                    <li> MultiChoice passively collects (i.e. without the user actively providing the information) personal information about a user as the user accesses and navigates through the DStv website using various technologies and means, such as navigational data collection and cookies. </li>
                    <li> A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier which MultiChoice's computer system transfers to a user's hard drive through the user's web browser when the user visits the DStv website.  It enables MultiChoice's system to recognise the user when the user visits the DStv website again and to improve our service to the user. </li>
                    <li> This enables MultiChoice to diagnose problems with its server, report and aggregate information, determine the fastest route for a user's computer to use in connecting with the DStv website, and better administer and improve the site.  It also enables MultiChoice to compile aggregate information about users' access to and use of the DStv website.  This information can be used to enhance the content of the DStv website and make it more user-friendly. </li>
                    <li> Please note that users may disable the use of cookies by configuring the user's browser accordingly.</li>
                    <p><strong>Consent to collection, use and storage of user's personal information</strong> </p>
                    <li> The user agrees that MultiChoice may collect, use and store the user's personal information
