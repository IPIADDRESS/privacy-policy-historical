<p class="MsoNormal">You do, however, have the right at any time to opt out of Doctors.net.uk contacting you in this way for marketing purposes.</p>
<h2>How does Doctors.net.uk use your personal data?</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to the specific uses mentioned elsewhere in this policy or in the Terms and Conditions (Clause 4 – Information for third parties), or for which you have given permission, Doctors.net.uk uses your personal data to provide services to you, to administer the site, to improve your browsing experience by personalising site content, to carry out membership administration, to let you know about other goods and services in which you may be interested, to inform you about changes and improvements to the Doctors.net.uk website and services, and for direct marketing purposes (but you do have the right to opt out of this).

<p class="MsoNormal">We may disclose information about you to any of our employees, officers, agents, suppliers or sub-contractors insofar as reasonably necessary for carrying out the purposes set out in this privacy policy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition, Doctors.net.uk may disclose your personal information:</p>
<ul class="list-1">
<li>to the extent that we are required to do so by law</li>
<li>in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings, and</li>
<li>in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights</li>
<li>when you provide consent to your personal data being passed to a third party</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition, Doctors.net.uk has agreements with sponsors and medical information companies, in relation to certain programs that we run on the website.
