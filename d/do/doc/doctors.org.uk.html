<p>Doctors.net.uk was set up to provide doctors with a service that they could trust. A central part of achieving such trust is the Doctors.net.uk privacy policy.</p>
<p>It is the rigorous enforcement of this policy that protects your privacy and ensures that your email remains free of the unwanted junk mail that over-runs so many typical email services.</p>
<p>Doctors.net.uk will never sell or pass on your email address without your permission and, in this context, “never” really does mean never.</p>
<h2>What information does Doctors.net.uk collect from you?</h2>
<p>We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal information:</p>
<ul class="list-1">
<li>information about your computer and about your visits to and use of the site</li>
<li>information that you provide to us for the purpose of registering with us</li>
<li>information that you provide to us for the purpose of subscribing to email notifications and/or newsletters</li>
<li>information that you provide to us as part of your participation in market research</li>
<li>any information that you choose to send to us</li>
</ul>
<p>as further described in the remainder of this privacy policy.</p>
<h2>How data is handled</h2>
<p>As described in the privacy policy (which you are recommended to read), you will occasionally be asked whether your personal data may be passed on to third parties, to help provide you with a better service. You will always be able to refuse permission if you so wish. Except as set out in the privacy policy, your personal data will not be passed on to any third parties.</p>
<p>Doctors.net.uk has, of course, notified under the Data Protection Act (Doctors.net.uk data registration number is Z5861600), but Doctors.net.uk's commitment to protecting your privacy goes further than that required by legislation. This is just one of the many benefits of a service that truly is run by doctors, for doctors.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the privacy policy - or any other aspect of the Doctors.net.uk service - please use the contact details below. For the purposes of the Data Protection Act, Doctors.net.uk Limited is the Data Controller.</p>

<h2>Consent</h2>
<p>Whenever you give Doctors.net.uk personal data, you are consenting to its collection and use in accordance with this privacy policy, including Doctors.net.uk contacting you by email and SMS to let you know about its services and to provide information (including promotional information) about other goods and services in which you may be interested. For example those of organisations such as professional colleges, DH, GMC, NICE, other government bodies, NHS Trusts, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, financial services companies and medical indemnity organisations.</p>
<p>You do, however, have the right at any time to opt out of Doctors.net.uk contacting you in this way for marketing purposes, except where this information is included in the Doctors.net.uk bulletin.</p>
<h2>How does Doctors.net.uk use your personal data?</h2>
<p>In addition to the specific uses mentioned elsewhere in this policy, or for which you have given permission, Doctors.net.uk uses your personal data to provide services to you, to administer the site, to improve your browsing experience by personalising site content, to carry out membership administration, to let you know about other goods and services in which you may be interested, to inform you about changes and improvements to the Doctors.net.uk website and services, and for direct marketing purposes (but you do have the right to opt out of this).</p>
<p>Doctors.net.uk may also use personal data to monitor the use of the site, to record traffic flows and to carry out research about member demographics, interests and behaviour. Doctors.net.uk does this to better understand the needs of members.</p>
<h2>To whom might Doctors.net.uk disclose your personal data?</h2>
<p>We may disclose information about you to any of our employees, officers, agents, suppliers or sub-contractors insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>In addition, Doctors.net.uk may disclose your personal information:</p>
<ul class="list-1">
<li>to the extent that we are required to do so by law</li>
<li>in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings, and</li>
<li>in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Doctors.net.uk has agreements with sponsors and medical information companies, regulating how they may use your personal data.</p>
<p>If you choose to participate in certain programmes run on the website (for instance by accessing the materials published in connection with it) your participation in that programme, together with your personal identifier, may be passed on to the sponsor of that programme or its associated companies and data processors. You will always be able to refuse permission for this data to be passed to the sponsor if you so wish. Some of the sponsors may be located outside the European Economic Area.</p>
<p>Sponsors undertake to use such data only for assessing your access (and the frequency of that access) to material provided by them via the Doctors.net.uk website for their internal auditing purposes.</p>
<p>Except as set out above, or with your permission, Doctors.net.uk will not disclose your personal data unless obliged to do so by law, or where Doctors.net.uk needs to do so in order to run its business (for instance where Doctors.net.uk outsources services for the processing of data.)</p>
<h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>Information that Doctors.net.uk collects may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate in order to enable us to use the information in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Information which you provide may be transferred to or accessed from countries (including the United States) which do not have data protection laws equivalent to those in force in the European Economic Area.</p>
<p>You expressly agree to such transfers of personal information.</p>
<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Doctors.net.uk respects the confidentiality of members and uses systems to help keep all data secure. With the increased use of electronic data collection, storage and distribution in the NHS, there is a need to ensure that information transmitted from doctor to doctor is only seen by those whom the sender intends to see it. As more data is generated, so the chance of it going astray increases. Any information exchange may result in a breach of security, but most complaints of a breach of confidence by health professionals are due to casual conversations in public places and not because of failures in electronic security.</p>
<p>Doctors.net.uk protects the confidentiality of information members send and receive by using a system of password protection for the website and a data storage solution with in-built security features. However, members are reminded of the GMC and BMA guidance that they should not send any patient identifiable data across the Internet and you should not post such information in the Forum area.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Doctors.net.uk will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. Doctors.net.uk will store all the personal information you provide on Doctors.net.uk's. secure (password- and firewall-protected) servers. Of course, data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure, and Doctors.net.uk cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.</p>
<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>Members set up an account using their GMC number to verify identity. Doctors.net.uk uses additional security details to verify your identity should you request support from the Doctors.net.uk Helpdesk. Doctors.net.uk also collects details about your seniority, specialty, clinical role and professional interests. This is used to tailor your experience of the Doctors.net.uk website.</p>
<h2>Updating profile information</h2>
<p>Doctors.net.uk gives members the option to change and modify information previously provided. To update profile information, click the 'Update Your Profile' link on your Homepage. In order to provide a service appropriate to your personal circumstances, you will be asked periodically to update information about your specialty, seniority and location. You are responsible for keeping your login details confidential.</p>
<h2>Member Directory</h2>
<p>The Member Directory on the website is available to all Doctors.net.uk members. This directory provides the full name, medical school, speciality and seniority of Doctors.net.uk members. Members are able to send and receive emails to and from other members, without any personal mail addresses being displayed. You may choose not to be listed in the Member Directory.</p>
