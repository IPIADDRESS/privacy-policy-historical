				provide our services. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" color="#000000">
				<span class="sub-header">Internal Service Providers for Our

				internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or 
				more aspects of the business, product and service operations 
				that we provide to you (e.g., search technology, authentication 
				systems, bill collection, and fraud detection) and therefore we 
				may provide some of your personal information directly to these 
				internal service providers. These internal service providers' 
				are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other 
				legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we 
				provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the 
				specific outsourced DocuSign related operation, unless you have 
				explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for 
				additional uses.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" color="#000000">
				<span class="sub-header">Legal Requests.</span> DocuSign 
				cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other 
				third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property 
				rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the 
				DocuSign community from bad actors. Therefore, in response to a 
				verified request by law enforcement or other government 
				officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged 
				illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your 
				name, city, state, telephone number, email address, UserID 
				history, fraud complaints, usage history without a subpoena. 
				Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy 
				and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we 
				will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law 
				enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, 
				court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except 
				when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information 
				is necessary to: prevent imminent physical harm or financial 
				loss; or report suspected illegal activity. Further, we can (and 
				you authorize us to) disclose your name, street address, city, 
				state, zip code, country, phone number, email, and company name 
				to DocuSign Internal Service Providers under confidentiality 
				agreement, as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or 
				appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, 
				intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful 
				activity. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" color="#000000">Due to the 
				existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of 
				your private communications and other personal information will

				password, including fees charged to your account, and all 
				actions taken with your account. Therefore we do not recommend

				If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial

				Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">We offer you 
				the ability to automatically review and change the information 
				you submit to us by logging into the Site and entering in the

				personal information based on your request because it is 
				difficult to authenticate your account manually. You can change 
				your password, contact information, financial information, and 
				user preferences by going the profile area. You must promptly 
				update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. 
				Changing your personal information will not impact any completed 
				transactions.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000">Upon your

				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" color="#000000">We will retain 
				in our files some personal information, and past document 
				transactions to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve 
				disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, 
				enforce our User Agreement and comply with legal requirements as 
				is permitted by law. Therefore, you should not expect that all 
				of your personal information will be completely removed from our 
				databases in response to your requests. However, such personal 
				information will be deactivated from member viewing and will 
				only be available to select DocuSign personal. </font></p>

				users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect 
				security" does not exist on the Internet. </font></p>
