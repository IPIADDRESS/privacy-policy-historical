		</h1>
      <!-- #EndEditable -->
      <!-- #BeginEditable "body1" -->
      <p>Overview </p>
		<p>The privacy practices of this statement apply to our services 
		available under the domain and sub domains of www.docusign.com (the 
		"Site") (including docusign.net, docusignexpress.com, and docusign-inc.com). 
		By visiting this website you agree to be bound by the terms and 
		conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree please do not use 
		or access our Site or products. </p>
		<p>This Privacy Policy describes the information, as part of the normal 
		operation of our services, we collect from you and what may happen to 
		that information. Although this policy may seem long, we have prepared a 
		detailed policy because we believe you should know as much as possible 
		about DocuSign's practices so that you can make informed decisions. </p>
		<p>By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in 
		registration, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your 
		personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This 
		Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the 
		DocuSign Terms of Use Agreement. This Privacy Policy is effective upon 
		acceptance in registration for new registering users, and is otherwise 
		effective on November 24th, 2003 for all users. </p>
		<p><b>1. Information We Collect. </b></p>
		<p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide 
		you with a safe, secure online application which will assist you in 
		sending and signing contracts. In order to do so, DocuSign must collect 
		information to identify users, and to allow our users to identify each 
		other. We only collect information about you that we consider necessary 
		for achieving this purpose. </p>
		<p>In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or 
		revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your 
		personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to use 
		our services, we may require you to provide contact and identity 
		information, billing information, shipping information and other 
		personal information as indicated on the forms throughout the Site. 
		Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields 
		are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by 
		choosing not to use a particular service or feature. </p>
		<p>Under some circumstances or users may require some additional 
		information in order to authenticate you such as, but not limited to: 
		your name, your address, or the last 4 digits of your social security 
		number. We may also use financial information, including credit card 
		information to verify the accuracy of your name, address, and other 
		information, as well as to bill you for your use of our services. Under 
		no circumstances will any of this information be used to generate a 
		credit scoring report that will show up against your credit. </p>
		<p>We automatically track certain information to increase security such 
		as IP addresses, email addresses, and other information. </p>
		<p>We may use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages 
		of the Site to help analyze our web page flow, measure effectiveness, 
		and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your 
		hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain 
		features that are only available through the use of a "cookie". We also 
		use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a 
		session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted 
		to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they 
		are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. 
		You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, 
		although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the 
		Site and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently 
		during a session. </p>
		<p>Additionally, the DocuSign Express™ client is loaded on your computer 
		if you wish to send documents for signature. This client is also 
		governed by this Privacy policy. </p>
		<p>If you establish a credit account with us to pay the fees we charge, 
		we collect some additional information, such as a billing address, a 
		credit card number and a credit card expiration date and tracking 
		information from checks or money orders. </p>
		<p>If you use DocuSign to send documents we will encrypt and store these 
		documents in an account and make the contents available only to those 
		whom you invite to view or sign these files. DocuSign employees do not 
		have access to this information, nor can they access your signature file 
		or other data, but it is stored in our system. </p>
		<p>If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, we 
		may collect such information into a file specific to you. </p>
		<p>If you register for DocuSign on another web site or use a web site 
		providing a service for DocuSign or a web site that helps facilitate 
		your activity on DocuSign, that web site may provide personal 
		information about you and your transactions back to DocuSign. </p>
		<p><b>2. Our Use of Your Information. </b></p>
		<p>We use your personal information to facilitate the services you 
		request. We use your personal information in the file we maintain about 
		you, and other information we obtain from your current and past 
		activities on the Site to: resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; help 
		promote safe exchange of documents for signature and delivery; collect 
		fees owed; authenticate users, inform you about online and offline 
		offers, products, services, and updates; customize your experience; 
		detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; 
		enforce our User Agreement; and as otherwise described to you at the 
		time of collection. At times, we may look across multiple users to 
		identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine 
		your personal information to identify users using multiple User IDs or 
		aliases. We may compare and review your personal information for errors, 
		omissions and for accuracy. </p>
		<p>If you choose to use our service and pay with credit card or 
		corporate invoice, we use your address and billing information to bill 
		you and provide associated support. </p>
		<p><b>3. Our Disclosure of Your Information. </b></p>
		<p>As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any of your personal 
		information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your 
		explicit consent. However, the following describes some of the ways that 
		your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of 
		business to provide our services. </p>
		<p>Internal Service Providers for Our Operations. We may use third 
		parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or 
		outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and service 
		operations that we provide to you (e.g., search technology, 
		authentication systems, bill collection, and fraud detection) and 
		therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to 
		these internal service providers. These internal service providers' are 
		subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal 
		restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them 
		for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced 
		DocuSign related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given 
		your prior permission to them for additional uses. </p>
		<p>Legal Requests. DocuSign cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, 
		as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual 
		property rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the 
		DocuSign community from bad actors. Therefore, in response to a verified 
		request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a 
		criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you 
		authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, 
		email address, UserID history, fraud complaints, usage history without a 
		subpoena. Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your 
		privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we 
		will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement 
		or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or 
		substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good 
		faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to: prevent 
		imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal 
		activity. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, 
		street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email, and 
		company name to DocuSign Internal Service Providers under 
		confidentiality agreement, as we in our sole discretion believe 
		necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, 
		intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity.
		</p>
		<p>Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all 
		of your private communications and other personal information will never 
		be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. 
		Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your 
		privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your 
		personal information or private communications will always remain 
		private, but you should know that we will take all reasonable steps to 
		provide you a highly secure environment. </p>
		<p><b>4. Your Use of Other Users' Information. </b></p>
		<p>In order to facilitate interaction among all DocuSign Express™ 
		members, our Product may allow you limited access other users' contact 
		and authentication status information. </p>
		<p>By entering into our User Agreement, you agree that, with respect to 
		other users' information that you obtain through the Site or through an 
		DocuSign-related communication or DocuSign-facilitated transaction, 
		DocuSign hereby grants to you a license to use such information only 
		for: (a) DocuSign-related communications that are not unsolicited 
		commercial messages, (b) using services offered through DocuSign (e.g. 
		document sending, signing, notarizing, etc), and (c) any other purpose 
		that a user expressly agrees to after you tell them the purpose you 
		would like to use it for. In all cases, you must give users an 
		opportunity to withdraw consent to sign electronically. In addition, 
		under no circumstances, except as defined in this Section, can you 
		disclose personal information about another user to any third party 
		without our consent and the consent of that user. You agree that other 
		users may use your personal information to communicate with you in 
		accordance with this Section. </p>
		<p>DocuSign and our users do not tolerate spam. Therefore, without 
		limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed to send any message to 
		another DocuSign user, (email or physical mail) without their express 
		consent. To report DocuSign related spam to DocuSign, please contact us 
		at info@docusign.com. </p>
		<p><b>5. Control of Your Password. </b></p>
		<p>You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and 
		password, including fees charged to your account, and all actions taken 
		with your account. Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your 
		DocuSign password to any third parties. If you lose control of your 
		password, you may lose substantial control over your personal 
		information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your 
		behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, 
		you should immediately change your password. </p>
		<p><b>6. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information.
		</b></p>
		<p>We offer you the ability to automatically review and change the 
		information you submit to us by logging into the Site and entering in 
		the new information yourself. Generally, we will not modify your 
		personal information based on your request because it is difficult to 
		authenticate your account manually. You can change your password, 
		contact information, financial information, and user preferences by 
		going the profile area. You must promptly update your personal 
		information if it changes or is inaccurate. Changing your personal 
		information will not impact any completed transactions. </p>
		<p>Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact 
		information, billing information, shipping information, and financial 
		information from our active databases. To make this request, email 
		sales@DocuSign.com. Such information will be deactivated as soon as 
		reasonably possible based on your account activity and in accordance 
		with our deactivation policy and applicable law. </p>
		<p>We will retain in our files some personal information, and past 
		document transactions to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve 
		disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce 
		our User Agreement and comply with legal requirements as is permitted by 
		law. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal 
		information will be completely removed from our databases in response to 
		your requests. However, such personal information will be deactivated 
		from member viewing and will only be available to select DocuSign 
		personal. </p>
		<p><b>7. Other Information Collectors. </b></p>
		<p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this 
		document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect 
		from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other 
		parties using our system, different rules may apply to their use or 
		disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Since DocuSign does 
		not control the privacy policies of third parties, or other individuals 
		actions, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party or 
		individuals. We encourage you to be sure the recipients are 
		authenticated to your satisfaction before you send them any documents.
		</p>
		<p><b>8. Security. </b></p>
		<p>Your information is stored on DocuSign Inc.'s servers located in the 
		United States. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect 
		your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized 
		access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption, 
		"firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers. We treat data as an asset that 
		must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many 
		different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized 
		access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect 
		security" does not exist on the Internet. </p>
		<p><b>9. Notice. </b></p>
		<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amend 
		terms on the Site. All amended terms shall automatically be effective 30 
		days after they are initially posted on the Site. In addition, we will 
		notify you in accordance with the law. </p>
