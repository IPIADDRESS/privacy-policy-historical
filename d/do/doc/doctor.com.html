    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>Last Updated: August, 26, 2012</h2><br class="cb">    <p></p><p> We value your right to privacy. This policygoverns the collection of personal information through the Doctor.com website(“Website”), the related &nbsp;platform (the “Platform”)and Doctor.com’s services generally (the “Services”) . This policy describesthe types of information we may collect from visitors and how that informationis used. Please read this policy carefully before providing us with anypersonal information. If you have questions about this policy, please&nbsp;<a href="http://www.doctor.com/contact_us">contact us</a>.</p>
<p> The policy was last  updated as of the date above and this represents the current policy in effect  and governing all personal information collected both before and after this  date (see below section&nbsp;<strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong>).</p>
<p> <strong>Information we collect</strong><br>
  <em>Unregistered  users</em>&nbsp;<br>
  You can register at Doctor.com to take advantage of personalization features.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  If you do not register, then the information we collect from you is limited. We  log your IP address in order to help diagnose problems with our server,  administer the WebsiteWebsite and track usage statistics. Your IP address may  vary each time you visit, or it may be the same. It would be extremely  difficult for us to identify you through your IP address, and we make no  attempt to do so. If you reached our site by clicking on a link or  advertisement on another site, we may log that information. All of this  information is collected and used only in the aggregate.<br>
  <br>
  We may place a small “cookie” file on your computer's hard drive. A cookie may  contain information that allows us to track your path through our Website and  to determine whether you have visited us before. Unless you register with us, the  cookie contains no personally identifiable information. We may use cookies to  help us understand how visitors use our Website, and to help us to improve. You  may elect not to accept cookies by changing settings in your browser.&nbsp;&nbsp; From  time to time our Website also may run usability testing to help us improve the  functions of the site for all users.&nbsp;  This may include recording random tests that track users’ actions and  movements on specific pages of the Website.&nbsp;  Our usability tests do not record fields that have personally  identifiable information entered by users in this Website.&nbsp; Our tests are also contained to our Website  and we do not track users behavior on other websites.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  <em>Registered users</em><br>
  If you choose to register with us, in addition to information that we collect  above you'll be able to add content to certain areas of our Website and also  participate with more of our site features. For example, you may enhance your  listing or you may participate in additional community or posting features. You  can provide your email address to receive newsletters and other information. If  you register with us, we will collect personal information from you in addition  to the non-personal information described above. That personal information may  include but is not limited to your name, email address, mailing address,  telephone number, doctor office information, work and educational history, user  name and password, as well as contact information. The information we collect  may vary, but we only collect the information that you manually enter into our  forms or otherwise authorize us to collect. We may store all or some of that  information in a cookie file on your hard drive, so that our system will  recognize you each time you visit our site. In that way, we can save your  preferences from visit to visit and present you with a customized Website,  without requiring you to log into our site every time you visit. The  information that you provide will also be used to enhance you listing if you  have one such that the public can better learn about you. To improve services  and enhance personalization, we may periodically obtain information about you  from other independent third-party sources and add it to your registration  information. Additionally, authorized personnel may update your registration  information to accurately reflect any new information included in  communications received from you.</p>
<p> If you reach our site through one of our partners and you choose to register  with us, we may be required to give our partner your registration information.</p>
<p>If you conduct personalized provider searches or sign  up for our medical team matching service and request to be matched with a team  of service providers meeting your criteria and preferences, we will collect  personal information from you regarding your personal health, medical concerns,  health insurance, and preferences about service providers and treatments, which  will be used to provide the Services.&nbsp; We  may also collect personal information from you if you utilize our appointment  or scheduling functionality on our Website or Platform.</p>
<p><strong>How we use the personal  information we collect</strong>&nbsp;<br>
  Registering allows you to personalize our Website so that it is most useful to  you. If you are a provider it allows you to edit and enhance your profile . &nbsp;Registering also allows you to log in to the  Website and the Platform to personalize your experience and gain access to information  you may have stored during previous use of the Services. We may use your  personal information to periodically contact you with news or important  information, to provide you with other information or invitations related to  your membership, and to request your feedback on our Website. In addition to  these periodic updates, we may email you additional marketing materials that  you have requested or that we believe would be of interest to you based upon  information you’ve provided . These marketing materials might include opt-in  newsletters and partner offers. You may opt-out of any or all marketing  communications in any commercial e-mail we send or at any time (opt-out links  are provided in all marketing-related emails and any fax or mail correspondence  we send you will also include opt-out instructions).<br>
  <br>
  We may also use certain information that you provide in order to present you  with advertising and offers that you may find interesting. This benefits both  of us. It benefits us because advertising helps pay the bills, and we can  charge our advertisers more if they know that their ads will be seen by  somebody more likely to find it useful. It benefits you because you see  advertising that is more likely to be interesting to you and because it permits  us to offer you a broader range of free services. Also information will be used  to help consumers more easily find the doctor that best meets their needs or  does not meet their needs.<br>
  Any information you provide pursuant to our  medical team matching service will be used to  match what you are seeking in a service provider to data we have gathered on  service providers in order to provide you with a list of service providers that  our systems determine to be the best match your preferences and criteria.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  You may choose to  participate in referral programs to friends or colleagues. In this case we will  contact those parties via the information that you give us or with messaging  sent from the “From” e-mail address you specify.</p>
<p> <strong>Disclosure of your personal information</strong><br>
  We may share some of your personally identifiable information with our parent  company, our subsidiaries and sister companies. We do not place restrictions on  the use of personal information by our parent company, subsidiaries, or  affiliates but require that they will treat it at least as protectively as they  treat information they obtain from their other users. They also will comply  with applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications,  and must give you an opportunity in any such email that they send to choose not  to receive such promotional e-mail messages in the future.</p>
<p> We may share your  personal information with service providers, if you authorize us to do so by  using our medical team matching service, if you request or schedule an  appointment through our Website or other services, or if you use any other tool  or feature of the Services that involves exchanging information with a  healthcare provider..&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  We also may share your personal information with third-parties engaged to  provide services to us (such as market research firms, marketing services  providers and advertising agencies). We will ensure those parties agree to use  any such personally-identifiable data solely for the purpose of providing the  specified services to us. &nbsp;We may also &nbsp;share &nbsp;personal information that is de-identified and  aggregated &nbsp;with third parties who are not  providing services to us, who may &nbsp;utilize such personal information for  advertising, data analysis, and analytics purposes.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  We must cooperate  with legal authorities, and may in some circumstances be required to disclose  personally identifiable information in response to requests from law  enforcement authorities, or in response to a subpoena or other legal process.  We can turn over information about you if we believe we must in order to  prevent a violation of the law, and by accepting this policy, you consent to  our doing so, in our sole discretion. You also consent to our disclosing  information about you in the course of legal proceedings if we are legally  required to do so, if we reasonably believe that doing so may mitigate our  liability, or if doing so will assist us in enforcing our legal rights. We also  may share your information in connection with a corporate transaction, such as  a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, and in the unlikely event  of bankruptcy.</p>
<p> <strong>Billing Information</strong><strong><br>
  </strong>Financial information including credit card and  bank account information, and other such billing information is not stored on  Doctor.com servers or in any Doctor.com databases unless you provide your  billing information to us outside of our normal secure billing process. When  you submit this information during checkout on the Doctor.com Website, the  information is encrypted and sent encrypted via a Secure Socket Layer (SSL)  connection to be processed by a secure third-party payment processing service  such as PayPal. Unless required by legal authorities, Doctor.com will never  share or disclose this information with any third-party aside from Doctor.com’s  payment processors, merchant accounts, and data security services.</p>
<p> <strong>Security of your personal information</strong><br>
  Any  information we collect from you will be collected pursuant to an SSL-secured  connection.&nbsp; We use commercially  reasonable efforts to implement all generally accepted, industry-standard best  practices for the protection of personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, no website or platform is &nbsp;entirely &nbsp;secure, and we cannot guarantee that&nbsp; your personal information will not be  intercepted or accessed by others.&nbsp; While  we have taken commercially reasonable precautions to protect the personal  information that you provide to us, you should exercise discretion in what you  provide to us, as there is always a risk that &nbsp;our Website or Platform&nbsp; may be compromised via a malicious attack, a  system failure, a&nbsp; human error, or another  vulnerability, which could result in the disclosure of personal information to  third parties. <br>
  Any third parties that we  share personal information with will be solely responsible for securing any  personal information that they receive from us.&nbsp;  All such personal information will be protected in accordance with such &nbsp;third parties’ security practices and  procedures then in-effect.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers</strong><br>
  Service  providers may be subject to certain obligations of patient confidentiality  pursuant to HIPAA, and are solely responsible for meeting all applicable HIPAA  obligations.</p>
<p> <strong>Newsletter E-mails, Faxes, and Postal Mail We Send to You</strong><br>
  At registration and at various times as you use our  Website, Platform, or Services, you will be given the option of receiving  recurring informational/promotional newsletters via email from Doctor.com  and/or directly from carefully chosen third parties. At any time you may choose  to Opt-In to receiving additional promotional emails from Doctor.com. In order  to subscribe to Doctor.com newsletters via email, you must provide us with your  contact information, such as your name and email address. You can unsubscribe  from the newsletters at any time by clicking on the "unsubscribe"  link at the bottom of any email newsletter or by contacting us. Once you have  submitted your unsubscribe request, please allow five business days for it to  be processed and for your email address to be removed from our list. .  Doctor.com may use third parties to help track activity or response to  promotion or trends. In some cases, this may occur when you click on a link or  an advertisement on the Website or in an e-mail or newsletter and your browser  may be momentarily directed to the website of a third party and such  redirection might occur fast enough that it is not apparent to you</p>
<p> <strong>E-mails, Faxes, and Postal Mail You Send to Us</strong><strong><br>
  </strong>This Privacy Policy does not apply to content,  business information, ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to us by  email, fax, or postal mail. If you want to keep content or business  information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not share  such information with Doctor.com.</p>
<p> <strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy<br>
  </strong>We reserve the right to change this policy should  we deem it advisable to do so. We will always post the latest date indicating  the most current policy in effect. Any update will automatically apply so we  encourage you to review. If we make material changes that will affect personal  information we have already collected from you, we will make reasonable efforts  to notify you of the changes and give you the opportunity to amend or cancel  your registration.</p>
