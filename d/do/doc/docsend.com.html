      <p>Last Modified: March 18, 2015 (“<b>Effective Date</b>“)</p>
<p>This privacy policy (“<b>Privacy Policy</b>“) is designed to inform you about DocSend, Inc.’s (“<b>DocSend</b>,” “<b>we</b>,” “<b>us</b>,” or “<b>our</b>“) policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information in connection with your use of the DocSend™ service. DocSend provides a web-based and mobile service designed to assist its users with sharing their information, content, materials, files and folders (together, their “<b>Stuff</b>“) and analyzing how their Stuff is viewed and/or received by their customers and others (the “<b>Service</b>“). Users can access the Service through our website <a href="https://docsend.com">https://docsend.com</a>, applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A “<b>Device</b>” is any computer used to access the DocSend Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the DocSend Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The Service is made available to users who have DocSend accounts (“<b>Users</b>“) via the web site located at https://docsend.com (the “<b>Site</b>“). DocSend Users use the Service to communicate with their customers, prospective customers, and other third parties that are not registered Users of the Service (“<b>Viewers</b>“).</p>
<p>The procedures for modifying or changing this Privacy Policy in the future are discussed in Section 13 of this document.</p>
<h3>1. The Information We Collect And Store</h3>
<p>We may collect and store both Non-Personally-Identifying information and Personally-Identifying Information from you. “<b>Non-Personally-Identifying Information</b>” is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity. “<b>Personally-Identifying Information</b>” or “<b>PII</b>” by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person or entity.</p>
<p>If you are located in a country in the European Union or elsewhere outside the United States of America, by using the Service, you specifically consent to the transmission and storage of your PII and Stuff into the United States of America.</p>
<h4>
<em>A. Our Collection and Storage of Personally-Identifying Information</em><br>
</h4>
<p class="slugline">Information You Provide as a User.</p>
<p>When you as a User register an account, you may be asked to disclose Personally-Identifying Information including without limitation, your name, phone number, email address, home address or business address. You may also choose to submit Personally-Identifying Information to us when you send us an email or use any interactive features that we may make available on the Service. For example, you may ask us to: (a) import your contacts by giving us access to your third party services (such as your email account) or (b) use your social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services. You may also provide us with your contacts’ email addresses when sharing folders or files with them or if you invite them to join DocSend, or choose to reveal Personally-Identifying Information in on-line for a, blogs, message boards, chatrooms that we may make available via the Service. In addition, if you sign up for our paid Service, you will be asked to provide additional information, including your credit card information, as described below in Section 8.</p>
<p>If you are a User, we may automatically collect information about your account and your interaction with and use of the Service. We collect this information in order to deliver the Service and to provide you with reporting and analytics relating to your use of the Service.</p>
<p>This information may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date and time you uploaded Stuff to our Service;</li>
<li>Whether or not Stuff was modified by you;</li>
<li>Number of times and length of time Stuff was presented by you using the Service;</li>
<li>Your phone number (if utilizing conference calling features); and</li>
<li>Your IP address and location.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is made available to Users via the Service and may be associated with other information about the User and its Viewers (including PII) that Users provide us.</p>
<p class="slugline">Information We Receive from Viewers.</p>
<p>If you are a Viewer, a User may request that you provide them with information (including PII) via the Services in order to view that User’s Stuff. DocSend stores this information on behalf of our Users. In the event you as a Viewer provide a User with this information, you do so in accordance with that User’s privacy practices and policies. DocSend is not responsible for the privacy practices of its Users, and does not access this information except with a User’s permission, in order to provide the Services and related support and assistance. If you are a Viewer of one of DocSend’s Users and would no longer like to be contacted by such User that uses DocSend’s Service, please contact the User that you interact with directly.</p>
<p class="slugline">Information We Receive from Third Parties.</p>
<p>We may also receive PII (such as your email address) through other Users, for example if they have tried to share something with you or tried to refer DocSend to you.</p>
<p class="slugline">Files.</p>
<p>We collect and store Personally Identifiable Information included in the files you upload, download, or access with the Service (“<b>Files</b>“). If you add a file to your account that has been previously uploaded by you or another user, we may associate all or a portion of the previous file with your account rather than storing a duplicate.</p>
<h4>
<em>B. Our Collection and Storage of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</em><br>
</h4>
<p class="slugline">Log Data.</p>
<p>When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol address (“<b>IP Address</b>“), operating system, browser type, the web pages you visited before you came to our website, the web pages you view immediately after leaving our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your Files, and other interactions with the Service.</p>
<p class="slugline">Cookies.</p>
<p>We also use “cookies” to collect information and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service.</p>
<p>IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE COOKIES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION PERSISTENT COOKIES AND SESSION ID COOKIES) PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSER TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING OUR SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF OUR SITE AND SERVICE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.</p>
<p class="slugline">Web Beacons.</p>
<p>A “<b>Web Beacon</b>” is an object that is embedded in a web page. It is usually invisible to you but allows site operators to check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email communication. We may place Web Beacons on pages of our website and in emails we send to you.</p>
<p>You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they may be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.</p>
<h3>2. How We Use Information</h3>

<h3>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
<h4>
<em>A. Our Sharing and Disclosure of Personally-Identifying Information</em><br>
</h4>
<p class="slugline">Your Use.</p>
<p>We will display your Personally-Identifying Information on your profile page and elsewhere on the Service according to the preferences you set in your account. You may access and change these preferences at any time as described in Section 4. Any Personally-Identifying Information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you. Please consider carefully what Personally-Identifiable Information you disclose in your profile page and your desired level of anonymity. You can review and revise your profile information at any time as described in Section 4. We do not sell your Personally-Identifying Information to third parties. We may also share or disclose your information with your consent, for example if you use a third party application to access your account (see below). Through certain features of the Service, you may also have the ability to make some of your information public. Public information may be broadly and quickly disseminated.</p>
<p class="slugline">Employees, Service Providers, Business Partners and Others.</p>
<p>We will disclose your Personally-Identifying Information to our employees, and we may use certain third party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve the Service (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the Service’s features). These third parties may have access to your Personally-Identifying Information for the purpose of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy. As of the Effective Date, we use Amazon’s S3 storage service to store some of your information (for example, your Files). You can find more information on Amazon’s data security from the S3 site at: <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/">http://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/security/">http://aws.amazon.com/security/</a>. In addition, as noted in Section 8, we use a third party credit card payment service to collect and process your credit card payments for any Service that you purchase for a fee (a “Purchased Service”). You can find more information on our provider’s privacy practices and other terms at <a href="https://stripe.com/us/terms">https://stripe.com/us/terms</a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy">https://stripe.com/us/privacy</a>.</p>
<p class="slugline">Third-Party Applications.</p>
<p>We may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access our Services through such an application. We are not responsible for what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you.</p>
<p class="slugline">DMCA Infringement Notifications, Notices of Violations of Website Terms of Service and Other Communications Directed to Us.</p>
<p>By submitting a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“<b>DMCA</b>“) Infringement Notification or other communication (including communications about content stored on or transmitted through this website or Service, you consent to have this communication forwarded to the person or entity who stored or transmitted the content addressed by your communications in order to facilitate a prompt resolution. For notices other than DMCA Infringement Notifications, upon request, we will edit out your name and contact information. However, DMCA Infringement Notifications (including any Personally-Identifying Information set forth in the notifications) will be forwarded as submitted to us without any deletions.</p>
<p class="slugline">Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of DocSend’s Rights.</p>
<p>We may disclose to parties outside DocSend files stored in your DocSend and information about you that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of DocSend or its users; or (d) to protect DocSend’s property rights. If we provide your DocSend files to a law enforcement agency as set forth above, we will remove DocSend’s encryption from the files before providing them to law enforcement. However, DocSend will not be able to decrypt any files that you encrypted prior to storing them on DocSend.</p>
<p class="slugline">Business Transfers.</p>
<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personally-Identifying Information or Files, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy.

For questions about your Personally-Identifying Information on our Service, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@docsend.com">privacy@docsend.com</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Data Retention</h3>

If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, you may delete your account by emailing <a href="mailto:support@docsend.com">support@docsend.com</a>.

<h3>8. Collection and Use of Information by Third Parties</h3>
<h4>
<em>A. General</em><br>
</h4>
<p>Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy with respect to Personally-Identifying Information that you provide directly to those third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves. We do not control the third-party sites that may be accessible through this Service. Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information you provide to third-party sites or gathered by the third parties that operate them. Before visiting a third-party site, whether by means of a link on this Service or otherwise, and before providing any Personally-Identifying Information to any third party, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that site, and should take those steps necessary to your discretion, to protect your privacy.</p>
<h4>
<em>B. Third Party Collection of Your Credit Card Information</em><br>
</h4>
<p>If you choose to subscribe to a Purchased Service, our third party credit card processor (<a href="https://www.stripe.com">Stripe</a>) will process your credit card. Accordingly, you authorize DocSend to collect, use, retain and disclose your credit card and other payment information to Stripe and represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to disclose such information to us. In addition, we may share your PII with trusted third parties who are integral to the operation of our Service, including but not limited to financial institutions, payment processors, verification services and credit bureaus, as well as any third parties that you have directly authorized to receive your PII. If you have questions about how Stripe protects the data it receives from DocSend Users, please refer to <a href="https://stripe.com/us/terms">https://stripe.com/us/terms</a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy">https://stripe.com/us/privacy</a>.</p>
<p>DocSend does not receive or store credit card information on our servers. We receive a transaction “token” and a one-time use ID number so we can validate that the transaction has been successfully completed. Areas of this Service that collect your Personally-Identifying Information use industry standard secure socket layer encryption; however, to take advantage of this your browser must support encryption protection.</p>
<h4>
<em>C. Other Third Party Collection of Other Information</em><br>
</h4>
<p>We may use third party companies including Google, KISSmetrics, and Intercom to provide us with analytics information. These companies may collect Personally-Identifying Information and Non-Personally-Identifying Information from you via our website and service. You can find out more information about what information Google collects and how it uses and discloses that information here: <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy</a>.

<h3>9. Security</h3>
<p>The security of your information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the Personally-Identifying Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:security@docsend.com">security@docsend.com</a>.</p>
<h3>10. Our Policy Toward Children</h3>
<p>Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. We do not knowingly collect Personally-Identifying Information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personally-Identifying Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@docsend.com">privacy@docsend.com</a>.</p>
<h3>11. Contacting Us</h3>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@docsend.com">privacy@docsend.com</a>.</p>
<h3>12. Online Tracking</h3>

<h3>13. Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time.
