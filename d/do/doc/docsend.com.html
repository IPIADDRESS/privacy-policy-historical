DocSend provides a web-based and mobile service (the “<strong>Service</strong>”) designed to assist users who have DocSend accounts (“<strong>Users</strong>”) with sharing their information, content, materials, files, and folders (together, their “<strong>Content</strong>”) and analyzing how their Content is viewed and/or received by their customers, prospective customers, and other third parties that are not registered Users of the Service (“<strong>Viewers</strong>”).</p><p>Users can access the Service through our website located at <a href="https://www.docsend.com">https://www.docsend.com</a> (“<strong>Site</strong>”), applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A “<strong>Device</strong>” is any computer used to access the DocSend Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device.</p><h4>Scope</h4><p>This Privacy Policy governs your access of the DocSend Service, regardless of how you access it, and explains what data we collect when you use the Site and/or the Service, why we collect the data, how it is used, and your rights and choices. This policy applies to personal data and other information collected by us from or about: (i) visitors to, or users of, our Site, (ii) prospective clients, (iii) current clients, (iv) job applicants.</p><p>While providing our Service, we collect information related to Viewers on behalf of our Users. Our use of information on behalf of our Users is governed by our contract with the applicable User and the User’s own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or privacy practices of Users or other third parties.</p><p>DocSend complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks (“<strong>Frameworks</strong>”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the processing of personal data transferred from the EU and the United Kingdom and Switzerland to the U.S. (for these purposes, reference to the EU also includes the European Economic Area countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). DocSend has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (described below). If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the EU or Swiss Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Frameworks and to view our certification page, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.</p><p>By using our Site or the Service you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.</p><h4>1. Information We Collect</h4><p>When you interact with the Site or the Service and in connection with our events, and sales and marketing activities, we collect information that alone or in combination with other information could be used to identify you (“<strong>Personal Data</strong>”), as described below:</p><p><strong><em>A. Information You Provide as a User</em></strong><br> When you register an account as a User, you may be asked to provide Personal Data including without limitation, your name, phone number, email address, home address or business address.</p><p>You may also choose to submit Personal Data to us when you send us an email or use any interactive features that we may make available on the Service. For example, you may ask us to: (a) import your contacts by giving us access to your third party services (such as your email account) or (b) use your social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services.</p><p>You may also provide us with your contacts’ email addresses when sharing folders or files with them or if you invite them to join DocSend. In addition, if you sign up for our paid Service, you may be asked to provide additional information, including your credit card information, as described below.</p><p><strong><em>B. Events</em></strong><br> We may also collect data from you including without limitation when you attend one of our events, during phone calls with sales representatives, or when you contact customer support.</p><p><strong><em>C. Employment Applications</em></strong><br> When you apply for employment through the Site, our provider of recruiting services will collect your resume and any additional information that you elect to provide to us, including but not limited to your employment history and education. In addition, where permitted by law, we may use a third party to carry out a background check to determine your suitability for a position.</p><p><strong><em>D. Information We Receive from Viewers</em></strong><br> If you are a Viewer, a User may request that you provide them with information (including Personal Data) via the Service in order to view that User’s Content. In particular, in order to access Content that a User wants to share with Viewers, a Viewer may be asked to provide his or her email address upon opening a DocSend User’s link (or Viewers’ email address may be provided by the User). DocSend stores this information on behalf of our Users. In the event you as a Viewer provide a User with this information, you do so in accordance with that User’s privacy practices and policies. DocSend is not responsible for the privacy practices of its Users, and does not access this information except with a User’s permission, in order to provide the Service and related support and assistance. If you are a Viewer of one of DocSend’s Users and would no longer like to be contacted by such User that uses DocSend’s Service, please contact the User that you interact with directly.</p><p><strong><em>E. Content</em></strong><br> In providing the Service, we process on behalf of Users information included in the Content that Users (and as appropriate Users’ representatives, employees or other data subjects as elected by Users) upload, download, or access with, share, or send through the Service (“<strong>Content</strong>”).
