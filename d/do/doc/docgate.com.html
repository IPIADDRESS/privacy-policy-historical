		<h3>About DocGate and the Information We Collect</h3>

<p><em>Profile Information submitted by Members to DocGate</em></p>
<p>DocGate is an online social content networking community where people can submit, share, vote and discover the best contents they and their friends care about. To accomplish this, each DocGate Member creates his or her own profile, which contains the personal information that the Member chooses to include. This personal information includes such things as:</p> 
<p>First name or first and last names of the Member (depending on the options selected by the Member), 
Gender, age, martial status and other, similar personal information, 
Occupation, 
Schools attended or companies with whom the Member is associated, 
Location (e.g., city and state), and 
Photos, videos or other shared content uploaded by the Member to his or her profile, to the extent that it includes personal information.</p>

<p><em>Other Information submitted by Members to DocGate</em> </p>
<p>DocGate also collects Member-submitted account information such as name and email address to identify Members, send notifications related to the use of the DocGate service and conduct market research and marketing for DocGate's internal use only.  You should also be aware that Members may reveal other personal information while communicating on other areas of the DocGate website, e.g., while participating in discussions and/or posting information on <a href="#">DocGate Spaces</a>. This information, in turn, might be viewed by other Members or visitors to the DocGate website who are not Members.</p>

<p><em>Information Not Directly Submitted by Members or Other Website Users to DocGate</em></p>
<p>Finally, we also collect some information from Members, as well as from other visitors to the DocGate website, that is not personally identifiable, such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered from all Members and visitors to the website.</p> 

<br><h3>Use of Information Obtained by DocGate</h3> 
<p><em>Sharing by Members of Profile Information </em></p>
<p>The personal information of a Member contained in his or her profile will be shown to those people whom the Member chooses. Each Member has three options when choosing the level of sharing of his or her profile. They are:</p> 
<p>"Friends" which consists only of that Member's friends, 
"Friends of Friends" which consists of that Member's friends, as well as the extended group of people who are friends of that Member's friends, and 
"Anyone" which is all visitors to the DocGate website, whether or not they are DocGate members. </p>
<p><b>PLEASE NOTE THAT, REGARDLESS OF WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION A MEMBER CHOOSES TO INCLUDE IN HIS OR HER PROFILE, OR WHAT LEVEL OF SHARING HE OR SHE CHOOSES, CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT EACH MEMBER WILL BE INCLUDED IN THAT MEMBER'S "PUBLIC PROFILE," WHICH IS AN ABBREVIATED VERSION OF A DOCGATE PROFILE. A LIST OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN EACH PUBLIC PROFILE CAN BE FOUND IN THE DocGate <a href="/docgate/terms.html">TERMS OF SERVICE</a>. PUBLIC PROFILES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANY USER OF THE DOCGATE WEBSITE, WHETHER OR NOT THE USER IS A MEMBER</b></p> 
<p><em>Display of Members' Information </em></p>
<p>Except where a Member might choose to include a full name in his or her profile, a Member's email address and full name will only be used in the following circumstances:</p> 
<p>When the Member invites a friend via email to become a DocGate Member, 
When the Member sends a request to another Member to add the other Member to his or her friend list, 
When we send notifications to the Member relating to his or her use of the DocGate service or DocGate website, and 
If the Member so chooses, when we send regular notifications, weekly updates, or other news regarding the DocGate service or the DocGate website. </p>
<p>Except when inviting or adding friends or as otherwise expressly set forth herein, a Member's email address will never be shared with or displayed to any other person. Members and their friends, and other Members within their personal networks (depending on the level of sharing a Member has chosen) communicate on DocGate with each other through the DocGate service, without disclosing email addresses.</p> 
<p><em>DocGate's Use of Members' Information </em></p>
<p>We use information relating to each Member's server information, IP address, and browser-type.</p> 
<h3>Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</h3> 
<p>Except as explained herein, or where you are expressly informed otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information unless required by law or for the protection of your Membership. However, DocGate may share profile information and aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable manner with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to Members and other users of the DocGate website more targeted advertising, products and services; provided that, in such situations, we will never disclose information that would personally identify you.  As set forth above, DocGate may (i) use your email address to conduct market research for DocGate's internal use only; and/or (ii) use your email address to market DocGate to you (e.g., new features and applications, announcements, opportunities of interest).  DocGate may contract with a third party to conduct such research and marketing; provided that such third party will be fully bound by an obligation of confidentiality to DocGate and may not use any personally-identifiable information provided by DocGate other than as expressly instructed by DocGate and in strict compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p> 
<h3>Links</h3> 
<p>The DocGate Website contains links to other websites. This includes links that are placed there by DocGate (such as in advertisements), as well as by other DocGate Members. Please be aware that DocGate is not responsible for the privacy practices of any other website. We encourage all Members and other users of the DocGate website to be aware of when they leave our website, and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by DocGate through the DocGate website.</p> 
<h3>Use of Cookies and Web Beacons</h3> 
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on the DocGate website. However, we do not and will not use cookies to collect private information from any Member or other user of the DocGate website which they did not intentionally submit to us other than as stated in this Privacy Policy.  We use both "session ID cookies" and "persistent cookies." We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Note also that Members may optionally use a cookie to remember their email in order to automatically log in to our website. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browsers's "help" file; however, please note that, if you reject cookies or disable cookies in your web browser, you may not be able to use the DocGate website.</p> 
<h3>Correcting/Updating or Removing Information</h3> 
<p><b>REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO MAY VIEW YOUR PROFILE AT ANY TIME. YOU CAN CHANGE THESE PROFILE SHARING SETTINGS BY CLICKING THE "SETTINGS" LINK IN THE TOP, RIGHT CORNER OF THE DOCGATE HOMEPAGE. ALSO, YOU CAN ALWAYS CHANGE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU'VE SUBMITTED TO THE DOCGATE WEBSITE, INCLUDING THE INFORMATION INCLUDED IN YOUR DOCGATE PROFILE, BY CLICKING THE "EDIT PROFILE" LINK ON YOUR DOCGATE PROFILE PAGE.</b></p> 
<h3>Changes in Our Privacy Policy</h3> 
<p>If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our web site so Members and other users of the DocGate website are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use Members' or other users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify those Members and users via email or by placing a prominent notice on our website.</p> 
<h3>Invite a Friend</h3> 
<p>If a Member elects to use our "Invite" feature to invite a friend to become a Member of the DocGate service, we ask them for that friend's email address. DocGate will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the site. DocGate stores this email address for the purpose of: (i) automatically adding the respondent to the âfriends listâ of the Member sending the invitation; (ii) sending reminders of the invitation and (iii) sending emails on recent updates by the Member on DocGate to the Member's invited friend.  DocGate will never sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. Any person who receives an invitation may <a href="/externals/feedback.php">contact DocGate</a> to request the removal of this information from our database.</p> 
<h3>Security</h3> 
<p>The DocGate account of every Member is password-protected. DocGate takes every precaution to protect the information of the Members, as well as information collected from other users of the DocGate website. We use industry standard measures to protect all information that is stored on our servers and within our database. We limit the access to this information to those employees who need access to perform their job function such as our customer service personnel. If you have any questions about the security at our website, please <a href="/externals/feedback.php">contact us</a>.</p> 
<h3>Email Choice/Opt-out</h3> 
<p>Members who no longer wish to receive our weekly email updates or other email notifications may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the instructions contained in the applicable email or by logging-in and changing their settings in the "Account Settings" section of the DocGate website. You can access this page by clicking on the "Settings" link on the top right of your DocGate homepage.</p>
