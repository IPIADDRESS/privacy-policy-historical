        <p> Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how 
        we collect and use the personal information you provide to us and to assist

        and services. </p>

<p>
<b>
What This Privacy Policy Covers
</b>
</p>

      <p> This policy covers how this website treats personal information that 
        collects and receives, including information related to your present use 
        or future use of its products and services. Personal information is information 
        about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email

        or manage. </p>

        <p> <b> What Information Do We Collect?</b> </p>

        <p> When you visit our Web site you may provide us with two types of information: 
          personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected

        <p><b>1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide</b></p>
        <p><b>Registration and User Profile Information</b></p>
        <p>You will provide us information about your name, address, email address, 
          birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, personal interests, 
          and your practices when you register for certain services, or register

          on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie

We recommend that minors between the ages of 13 and 18 ask and receive their parents' permission 
before using this website or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.
</p>
        <p><b>Email Information</b></p>
        <p>If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the 
          content of your email messages together with your email address and 
          our responses.</p>
        <p><b>2. Web Site Use Information</b></p>
        <p>Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard 
          technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What 
          Are Cookies?") and Web server logs to collect information about 
          how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web 
          server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, 
          time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and 
          just after our Web site. We, our advertisers and ad serving companies 
          may also use small pieces of code called “web beacons” or 
          “clear gifs” to determine which advertisements and promotions 
          users have seen and how users responded to them.<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</b></p>
        <p>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering 
          and expanding our business activities, providing customer service and 
          making available other products and services to our customers and prospective 
          customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect 
          to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services 
          and special offers we think you will find valuable.</p>
        <p><b>What Are Cookies?</b></p>
        <p>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous 
          unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks 
          your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard 
          drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its 
          own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but 
          (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access 
          the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you 
          by other sites.</p>
        <p><b>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</b></p>
        <p>As you shop on our Web site, the site uses its cookies to differentiate 
          you from other shoppers so your shopping cart is only available to you. 
          In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from seeing unnecessary 
          advertisements or requiring you to log in more than is necessary for 
          security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow 
          us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site 
          and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback 
          in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers. 
          Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you 
          and we do not generally store any personal information that you provided 
          to us in your cookies.</p>
        <p><b>Sharing Information with Third Parties</b></p>
        <p>We may enter into alliances, partnerships or other business arrangements 
          with third parties who may be given access to personal information including 
          your name, address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing 
          you information regarding products and services that we think will be 
          of interest to you. In connection with alliances, partnerships or arrangements, 
          we may also provide certain information to third parties if we have 
          determined that the information will be used in a responsible manner 
          by a responsible third party. For example, some of our partners operate 
          stores or provide services on our site, while others power offerings 
          developed by us for your use. We also use third parties to facilitate 
          our business, including, but not limited to, sending email and processing 
          credit card payments. In connection with these offerings and business 
          operations, our partners and other third parties may have access to 
          your personal information for use in connection with business activities. 
          As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. 
          Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred 
          business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer 
          such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or 
          any dissolution.</p>
        <p><b>Notice of New Services and Changes</b> </p>
        <p>Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify 
          you about important changes to our Web site, new services and special 
          offers we think you will find valuable.</p>
        <p><b>How Do We Secure Information Transmissions?</b></p>
        <p>Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this 
          reason, we request that you do not send private information to us by 
          email. Some of the information you may enter on our Web site may be 
          transmitted securely via Secure Sockets Layer SSL. Pages utilizing this 
          technology will have URLs that start with HTTPS instead of HTTP.</p>
        <p><b>Certain Disclosures</b></p>
        <p>We may disclosure your personal information if required to do so by 
          law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) 
          conform to the law or comply with legal process served on us or Affiliated 
          Parties; (b) protect and defend our rights and property, the Site, the 
          users of the Site, and/or our Affiliated Parties; (c) act under circumstances 
          to protect the safety of users of the Site, us, or third parties.</p>
        <p><b>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</b></p>
        <p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked 
          to or from our Web site nor the information or content contained therein. 
          Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information 
          on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site.</p>
        <p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Web site to 
          another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing 
          and interaction on any other Web site, including Web sites which have 
          a link on our Web site, is subject to that Web site's own rules and 
          policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>
        <p><b>Your Consent</b></p>
        <p>By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your 
          personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
        <p><b>
Changes to this Policy
</b></p>

<p>
Please note this Privacy Policy will change from time to time. We will post those changes on this page.
