    <td width="574" valign="top"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body of Text" -->Thank you 
      for visiting the Department of Commerce Web site, a service of the U.S. 
      Department of Commerce. This policy establishes how we will handle information 
      we learn about you from your visit to our site. Please be assured that the 
      privacy of our visitors is of utmost importance to us. <strong>We collect 
      no personally identifiable information about you when you visit our site 
      unless you choose to provide that information to us. </strong> 
      <p>The specific practices outlined in this privacy statement apply to Web 
        sites maintained by or on behalf of the Office of the Secretary of Commerce. 
        Other organizations within the Department of Commerce may have slightly 
        different practices, though the overarching commitment to your privacy 
        will always be the same. You are encouraged to review the privacy policies 
        of other organizations when visiting their Web sites.</p>
      <p>Some of our Web pages contain links to Web sites outside the Department 
        of Commerce, including those of other federal agencies, state and local 
        governments, and private organizations. Please be aware that when you 
        follow a link to another site, you are then subject to the privacy policies 
        of the new site.</p>
      <p><strong>Your Rights under the Privacy Act</strong>: Information concerning 
        the Privacy Act can be found on the following Web site:<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/foia/foiprivacyact.htm"> 
        http://www.cftc.gov/foia/foiprivacyact.htm</a></p>
      <p><strong>Automatic Collections: </strong>For each HTTP (which is what 
        your Web browser generates when you request a page or part of a page from 
        a Web site) request received, we collect and store only the following 
        information: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the date and time </li>
        <li> the originating IP address </li>
        <li> the type of browser and operating system used (if provided by the 
          browser) </li>
        <li> the URL of the referring page (if provided by the browser) </li>
        <li> the object requested </li>
        <li> completion status of the request </li>
        <li> pages visited </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>How the Information is Used:</strong> We use the information 
        that we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different areas 
        of our sites, and to help us make our sites more useful to visitors. This 
        includes analyzing these logs periodically to determine the traffic through 
        our servers, the number of pages served, and the level of demand for pages 
        and topics of interest.</p>
      <p><strong>How Long is the Information Retained:</strong> The logs may be 
        preserved indefinitely and used at any time and in any way necessary to 
        prevent security breaches and to insure the integrity of the data on our 
        servers.</p>
      <p><strong>Privacy Act System of Records</strong>: The Office of the Secretary 
        Web sites do not maintain any Privacy Act System of Records (PASOR) as 
        defined by the Privacy Act. </p>
      <p> <strong>Interaction with Children:</strong> The Office of the Secretary 
        Web sites do not provide content to children and do not collect personally 
        identifiable information from these visitors. Therefore, the requirements 
        of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is not incorporated 
        in this privacy policy.</p>
      <p><strong>Cookies</strong>: The Office of the Secretary does not use "persistent 
        cookies" or any other persistant tracking methods to collect personally 
        identifiable information about visitors to its Web sites.</p>
      <p>Cookies are small files that Web servers place on a user's hard drive. 
        They can serve several functions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>they allow the Web site to identify you as a previous visitor each 
          time you access a site; </li>
        <li> they track what information you view at a site (important to commercial 
          sites trying to determine your buying preferences); </li>
        <li> in the more advanced cases they track your movements through many 
          Web sites but not the whole Web; </li>
        <li> businesses use them for customer convenience to allow them to produce 
          a list of items to buy and pay for them all at one time and to garner 
          information about what individuals are buying at their sites; </li>
        <li> advertisers use them to determine the effectiveness of their marketing 
          and offer insights into consumer preferences and tastes by collecting 
          data from many Web sites; and </li>
        <li> they can be used to help a Web site tailor screens for each customer's 
          preference. <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>To protect your privacy, be sure to close your browser completely after 
        you have finished conducting business with a Web site that does use cookies. 
        If you are concerned about the potential use of the information gathered 
        from your computer by cookies, you can set your browser to prompt you 
        before it accepts a cookie. Most Internet browsers have settings that 
        let you identify and/or reject cookies. </p>
      <p><strong>Personal Information via Forms</strong>: Some of our sites provide 
        forms allowing visitors to submit search engine queries, questionnaires, 
        feedback, or other information. Some of these forms may request personally 
        identifiable information (e.g., name, address, e-mail address) for specific 
        purposes, such as when the submitter is requesting a personal response, 
        registering for a conference, or subscribing to a mailing list. <strong>All 
        information submitted by visitors is voluntary.</strong></p>
      <p>We may store non-personally identifiable information we collect (such 
        as search engine queries and anonymous survey responses) indefinitely 
        to help us better understand and meet the needs of our visitors. We may 
        share non-personally identifiable information with others, including the 
        public, in aggregated form (for instance, in a list of our most popular 
        search engine queries), in partial or edited form (such as in a report 
        summarizing responses to a questionnaire), or verbatim (for example, in 
        a complete listing of survey responses).</p>
      <p>Before collecting personally identifiable information, we will prominently 
        disclose: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>why we are requesting the information; </li>
        <li> how it will be used; </li>
        <li> how long it may be retained; and </li>
        <li> under what conditions, and with whom, it may be shared. <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Consent to Information Collection /Sharing: </strong>Generally, 
        we will not share any personally identifiable information you give us 
        with any other government agency, private organization, or the public, 
        except with your consent or as required by law. <strong>By pressing the 
        "submit" button, each visitor constitutes consent to use the 
        information for purposes stated in this policy.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>How e-mail is Handled: </strong>By sending us an electronic mail 
        message (for example, an e-mail message containing an official Freedom 
        of Information Act request), you may be sending us personally-identifying 
        information. In these cases, we may retain the information as long as 
        necessary to respond to your request or otherwise resolve the subject 
        matter of your e-mail. Please be aware that email is not necessarily secure 
        from interception or misdirection. For your own protection you may wish 
        to communicate sensitive information using a method other than email.</p>
      <p><strong>Information Protection</strong>: We want to be very clear: regardless 
        of the information being transmitted to any unit of the Department of 
        Commerce, we will protect all such information consistent with applicable 
        law including, but not limited to, the<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/foia/foiprivacyact.htm"> 
        Privacy Act of 1974</a> and the Freedom of Information Act. </p>
      <p>For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available 
        to all users, this government computer system employs software programs 
        to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload 
        or change information, or otherwise cause damage to the information on 
        our Web sites. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information 
        on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the 
        Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure 
        Protection Act. </p>
      <p>Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts 
        are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data 
        logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction 
        in accordance with <a href="http://www.archives.gov/records_management/ardor/grs20.html">National 
        Archives and Records Administration General Schedule 20</a>.</p>
      <p>The Office of the Secretary may share information received from its Web 
        sites with other Federal agencies. For example, if a breach of our IT 
        security protections were to occur, the information collected by our servers 
        and staff could be shared with appropriate law enforcement and Homeland 
        Security officials. </p>
