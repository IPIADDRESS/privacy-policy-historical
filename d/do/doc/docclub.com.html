		<h1>Doc Club Privacy POLICY</h1>
		<strong>EFFECTIVE DATE: February 19, 2015</strong>

		<h2>1. WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY?</h2>
		<p>
			This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is incorporated into the Digital Store <a href="http://www.docclub.com/terms-of-use/">Terms of Service</a>, and applies to information obtained by us when you sign up for, use, access, download or otherwise interact with any Digital Store applications, mobile applications, games, sweepstakes, products, services, or websites and anywhere else where this policy is posted, including applications we make available on third party sites or platforms, if disclosed to you in connection with your use of the application (collectively, “Services”). This Policy does not apply to information that is collected outside the Services. This Policy applies regardless of whether you access the Services using a personal computer, mobile device, gaming console or other equipment or device.  If you disagree with the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Services.
		</p>

		<h2>2. WILL THIS POLICY EVER CHANGE?</h2>
		<p>
			We may change this Policy from time to time.  If we make changes, we will notify you by posting the updated policy and revising the “Effective Date” above.  Use of the Services after the posted Effective Date means you accept the current version of the Policy, including any changes made prior to the posted Effective Date. If we make any material changes to this Policy, we will also notify you by email or by means of a notice on the Services. We encourage you to review the Policy whenever you use our Services to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.
		</p>

		<h2>3. WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED FROM ME?</h2>
		<p>
			<strong><em>Information you provide to us</em></strong>: We collect information that you submit to us. For example, the process of creating or editing your user profile on a Service may require you to provide us with a name, e-mail address, phone number, physical address, including zip code, password of your choice and cable provider.  When you personalize your profile and use the features of the Services, we will collect any information you voluntarily provide, and we may also request optional information to support your use of the Services, such as a profile picture and birthday.  Additionally, we collect any information that you voluntarily enter into any postings, comments or forums within the Services, including private messages you send to other users of the Services. And, if you send an e-mail to us, we will collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files and other information you choose to provide to us. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong><em>Information We Collect Automatically From Your Devices</em></strong>:  When you use our Services, we may collect information about the device you use to access the Services, including hardware model, operating system and version, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address and other unique device identifiers, mobile network information and information about the device’s interaction with our Services.  We also collect information about how you use our Services, including your access times, browser types and language.  We may use this data alone or in aggregate form, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that is intended to identify you personally.  This type of data enables us to understand how often individuals use parts of the Services so we can analyze and improve them.  To collect this information, we use cookies and web beacons, and may in the future use other similar technologies.  To learn more about how we automatically receive and record information when you interact with the Services, please review our Cookies Policy.  This policy covers only our use of cookies; it does not cover the use of cookies or other technologies by third parties.

		</p>

		<p>
			<strong><em>Location Information</em></strong>:  We may collect different types of information about your location, including general information, such as the city, state and/or zip code associated with your IP Address, and, if you agree, more specific location information that is provided through the GPS functionality on mobile devices used to access the Services. We may use such location information to customize the Services, including advertising that is presented to you. For example, if you provide a zip code that indicates that you live in New York, the Services may be customized with New York-specific information, features, and advertisements. In order to do this, your location information may be passed along to our affiliates, agents, vendors or advertisers.  Options you have to control the automatic collection of location information are explained below under “What Are My Choices.”

You may also give us permission to access your information, including personally identifiable information from services offered by third parties, including social media networks.  For example, to access the Services, you may need to link your Facebook account to the Services, which allows us to obtain information from your Facebook account, such as your friends or contacts, profile picture, birthdate, gender, or other profile-related information and any other information you have opted to share with “everyone” on Facebook (or similar third party platform).  The information we obtain from third party services depends on your account/privacy settings with those third parties and the third parties’ privacy policies, so be sure to check those policies and to adjust your settings to meet your preferences. When you access the Services through social media networks and other third party platforms, you are authorizing Digital Store to collect, store and use such information and content in accordance with this Policy. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal information that we collect through the Services, we will treat the combined information as personal information in accordance with this Policy.
