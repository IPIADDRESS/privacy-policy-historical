										<li class="cat-item cat-item-20"><a href="http://www.documentary-log.com/category/anthropology/" title="ANTHROPOLOGY DOCUMENTARIES: where  science meets history! What is more exciting than a good anthropology documentary about ancient Egypt, the dinosaurs and buried cities? By watching anthropology documentaries we learn about ourselves, about the Earth, and about where we are headed as a species. Anthropology is the science of buried treasure. Watch anthropology documentaries from this list. Enjoy!">Anthropology</a> (51)

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-12"><a href="http://www.documentary-log.com/category/astronomy-space/" title="Astronomy and Space Documentaries are a very special category. They ask the questions: what is out there? Are we alone in the universe? And many more. Astronomy and space helped us put a man on the moon and now the possibilities are endless.  Some of these astronomy and space documentaries look like episodes of Star Trek, the technology has become so advanced in the 21st century. It's exciting! The best of the astronomy and space documentaries are listed below. Space, the final frontier...enjoy!">Astronomy, Space</a> (129)

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-19"><a href="http://www.documentary-log.com/category/biography/" title="Biography Documentaries are about people; important people; people who made a difference in this world. Biography Documentaries are important for highlighting those who deserve to be discussed. A biography doesn't have to be about a king or a queen, a President or a dictator. It can be about a fashion biography, a philosphy biography, or a biography about a layman - who we choose to make biography documentaries about tells us as much about our society as it does about the person being documented. Want to learn about another human life? You've come to the right place. Enjoy the biography documentary list below. ">Biography</a> (66)

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-13"><a href="http://www.documentary-log.com/category/biology-environment/" title="Biology, Environment documentaries are listed below. These are the best biology and environment documentaries made in the last few decades. As scientists learn more about biology the possibilities become endless and this is reflected in our collection of Biology documentaries.  And, let's not forget about the environment.  It's time to remember: to learn: to ACT. Environment documentaries such as Al Gore's have helped stir the world to action. Communities are rising to help. Just by watching a biology and environment documentary you are helping in the fight of Mother Nature's life. Knowledge is power! enjoy ">Biology, Environment</a> (128)

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-25"><a href="http://www.documentary-log.com/category/business-economy/" title="Business Documentaries are our most shocking documentaries in our collection, in my opinion. Business documentaries and economy documentaries tell us about greed, power, corruption and THE TRUTH about our economy. Donald Trump, Bernard Madoff, Andrew Carnegie: the movers and shakers. But business and economy documentaries tackle other subjects besides the negative side of capitalism: there are philanthropists, altruistic geniuses, and many other theories ranging from socialism and communism to oil barons and dot.com billionaires. Watch business, economy documentaries now. ENJOY ">Business, Economy</a> (51)

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-22"><a href="http://www.documentary-log.com/category/cosmology-physics/" title="Cosmology, Physics Documentaries are FASCINATING. Some students might remember a boring Wonder Years type professor droning on in high school, but times have changed, the physics documentary has changed, and cosmology and physics documentaries are as cutting edge as a knife, but far more penetrating into what makes the world tick.  Watch one physics or cosmology documentary and you will be hooked. Guaranteed. ">Cosmology, Physics</a> (111)

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-23"><a href="http://www.documentary-log.com/category/crime/" title="Crime Documentaries are hard hitting and take no prisoners. They also tend to be among the more captivating of documentary genres, in that crime documentaries have a compelling narrative. A crime documentary is about a crook, or crooks, or even a corrupt society (think Mexican drug trade or Italian and Russian mafias).  Crime documentaries can be about murder, bank robberies, and...well, enjoy the crime documentaries below and you'll see what I mean. They're all INCREDIBLE. I bet you can't watch just one.  Crime Documentaries turn us all into Sherlock Homes for an hour, and what's cooler or more terrifying than that?">Crime</a> (28)

Who do we turn to when we have health questions?  Our doctors!  If they aren't available right away or cannot help at all then we turn to the internet.  We all want to know how to help ourselves.  We all want the best information possible to do it with.  We all want to have the choice whether or not to take one person's advice or another or mix them both if we so choose to experiment.  It is our bodies, our life, our will to be happy, healthy and free of dis-ease.  With all of the available information scattered throughout the web about health &amp; wellness why not give these health documentaries a watch.

There's nothing wrong with fiction, but history is filled with the most amazing stories ever told. History documentaries are about anything that happened yesterday: history documentary on culture, on war, on food, on fashion. History documentaries tell us about our ancestors: who they were, how they dressed, how they loved and how they died. History documentaries are very dear to my heart and these are all chosen with love. Enjoy. ">History</a> (94)

Life documentaries are about exactly that: life - or, something like it. This is a celebration of life, or society and what humanity has created with our imaginations. Lifestyle and society documentaries are about communities, the choices we make, and where that takes us. Enjoy!">Lifestyle, Society</a> (137)

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-32"><a href="http://www.documentary-log.com/category/nature/" title="Nature Documentaries tell the greatest biography of them all: Mother Nature's. Our fragile world isn't always so fragile. Sometimes it's a savage fight for survival: a hurricane, or a tidal wave and a volcano.  But, nature can also be as delicate as beautiful spider's web and as graceful as a humming bird's wings. Nature documentaries are about the whale, the ant, the land, the sea, the sky.
