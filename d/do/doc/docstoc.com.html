		    <h6>Links to Third-Party Sites/Opt-Out for Non-PII Collection for Network Services</h6>
		    <p>
                We use third-party advertising companies and advertising
			    networks to serve advertisements to You on our behalf when You visit our Website, and to
			    optimize advertisements. These, and other companies may use information (typically not

			    Your company name and job title gathered from Your DOCSTOC profile information) about
			    Your visits to a DOCSTOC Platform and other Websites in order to provide advertisements
			    about goods and services of interest to You, as well as to provide us with information
			    that is intended to make our Platforms and Services better, and for other business
			    reasons. They, or we, may do this by using cookies, pixels, and web beacons, among other
			    things.

		    </p>
		
		    <p>
                Although we may attempt to contractually limit what
			    third-party advertising companies and networks do, we have no ability to monitor or
			    control what they do. In the past, some advertising companies and networks have been sued
			    for allegedly using what are called “local shared objects” or
			    “re-spawning cookies” (including by using Adobe®&nbsp;flash cookies).
			    Although we attempt to contractually require that these companies shall always allow the
			    end-user (You) to easily and completely uninstall any means of tracking the end-user
			    without regenerating the means of such tracking, we cannot assure that this will occur
			    and, therefore, You consent to these types of practices. If You would like more
			    information about what many advertising companies and advertising networks do and to know
			    some of Your choices about not having this information used by the companies that are
			    member of the Network Advertising Initiative, please visit&nbsp;

			    United States of America, which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to that
			    required in the European Union. In particular, You are advised that the United States of
			    America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation,
			    governmental regulation, and self-regulation. Article 26 of the European Union's Data
			    Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of
			    personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has
			    unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of
			    the third country's level of protection. By agreeing to the terms of use and this privacy
			    policy, You consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of
			    America, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the
			    European Union and to the processing of that information by DOCSTOC on its servers
			    located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.
