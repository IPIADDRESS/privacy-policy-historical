<h4>Information you provide on our partners' websites</h4>
<p>You may find links to third party websites on our website. These hyperlinks are provided for your reference and convenience only and do not imply any endorsement of the activities of such third-party websites or any association with their operators. This Privacy Policy only applies to the personal information that we collect or which we receive from third party sources, and we cannot be responsible for personal information about you that is collected and stored by third parties.

<h4>Information we get when you use our service</h4>
<h4>Your redemption information</h4>
<p>When you use DontPayFull we will collect information about how you use our site. For example, when you redeem a coupon we’ll record details of the offer, the date and time and the device you’ve redeemed it on. We’ll use this information to personalise the offers we show you in future.</p>

<p>When you use our website we may receive your location or ask to use it. We’ll use this to show you the offers which are near you.</p>
<h4>Cookies and similar technologies</h4>
<p>Some pages on our website use cookies, which are small files placed on your internet browser when you visit our website. We use cookies in order to offer you a more tailored experience in the future, by understanding and remembering your particular browsing preferences.</p>
<p>Where we do use cookies on your website, you may block these at any time. To do so, you can activate the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies), you may not be able to access all or parts of our website or to use all the functionality provided through our website.</p>
<p>For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them, please refer to our cookies policy <a href="/page/cookie-policy">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Directly communicating with DontPayFull</h4>

<h4>To personalise the content you receive</h4>
<p>By collecting data on your activities on our website we’ll be able to better understand the types of offers that you’re interested. We’ll then present the most relevant offers for you on our website and through the communications we send you.</p>
<h4>To provide a better experience</h4>
<p>Our use of cookies and other similar technologies enables us to remember information about you when you visit our site. We use this to improve your experience by doing things like remembering your password, automatically logging you into your account and showing you adverts for offers that you’ve previously searched. We also use your data for the improvement and maintenance of our website and to provide technical support for our website.</p>
<p>We also use your data to evaluate your visit to the website and prepare reports or compile statistics to understand the type of people who use our website, how they use our website and to make our website more intuitive. Such details will be anonymised as far as reasonably possible and you will not be identifiable from the information collected.</p>
<h4>To provide insight</h4>
<p>Our use of technologies, including Google Analytics enables us to gather statistical information about how people use our site and application. As well as using this to improve what we do, we also share it with the brands we work with to give them feedback. The information we share will not identify you personally, it is statistical data and does not identify any personal details whatsoever.</p>
<h4>Other uses</h4>
<p>We may also collect, use and store your personal information for the following additional reasons:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>to deal with any enquiries or issues you have about how we collect, store and use your personal information, or any requests made by you for a copy of the information we hold about you. If we do not have a contract with you, we may process your personal information for these purposes where it is in our legitimate interests for customer services purposes;</li>
<li>for internal corporate reporting, business administration, ensuring adequate insurance coverage for our business, ensuring the security of company facilities, research and development, and to identify and implement business efficiencies. We may process your personal information for these purposes where it is in our legitimate interests to do so;</li>
<li>to comply with any procedures, laws and regulations which apply to us – this may include where we reasonably consider it is in our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others to comply, as well as where we are legally required to do so; and</li>
<li>to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights – this may include where we reasonably consider it is in our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others, as well as where we are legally required to do so.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Legal Basis for Processing</h4>
<p>We consider that the legal bases for using your personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy are as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>our use of your personal information is necessary to perform our obligations under any contract with you (for example, to fulfil an order which you place with us, to comply with the terms of use of our website which you accept by browsing our website); or</li>
<li>our use of your personal information is necessary for complying with our legal obligations (for example, for health and safety purposes); or</li>
<li>where neither (a) nor (b) apply, use of your personal information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others (for example, to ensure the security of our website). Our legitimate interests are to:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>run, grow and develop our business;</li>
<li>operate our website;</li>
<li>carry out marketing, market research and business development;</li>
<li>place, track and ensure fulfilment of orders with our suppliers; and</li>
<li>for internal group administrative purposes</li>
</ol>
<p>If we rely on our (or another person's) legitimate interests for using your personal information, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the other person's) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the personal information. You can ask us for information on this balancing test by using the contact details at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may process your personal information in some cases for marketing purposes on the basis of your consent (which you may withdraw at any time after giving it, as described in this Privacy Policy).</p>
<p>If we rely on your consent for us to use your personal information in a particular way, but you later change your mind, you may withdraw your consent by contacting us at gdpr@dontpayfull.com and we will stop doing so. However, if you withdraw your consent, this may impact the ability for us to be able to provide offers and discounts and associated services to you (for example, we may not be able to provide marketing information to you regarding our suppliers' products and services).</p>
<h4>How and why we share your personal information with others</h4>
<p>We will share your personal information with the following third parties or categories of third parties:</p>
<ol>
<li>we may share anonymised and aggregated statistical information with our suppliers to demonstrate what interest there has been in any marketing campaigns we have assisted our suppliers in carrying out;</li>
<li>our other service providers and subcontractors, including payment processors, utility providers, suppliers of technical and support services, insurers, logistic providers, and cloud service providers;</li>
<li>companies that assist in our marketing, advertising and promotional activities;</li>
<li>analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our website; and Any third parties with whom we share your personal information are limited (by law and by contract) in their ability to use your personal information for any purpose other than to provide services for us. We will always ensure that any third parties with whom we share your personal information are subject to privacy and security obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will also disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>
<ol>
<li>where it is in our legitimate interests to do so to run, grow and develop our business: a. if we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; b. if substantially all of our or any of our affiliates' assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal information held by us will be one of the transferred assets;</li>
<li>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, any lawful request from government or law enforcement officials and as may be required to meet national security or law enforcement requirements or prevent illegal activity;</li>
<li>in order to enforce or apply our terms of use, our terms and conditions for customers or any other agreement or to respond to any claims, to protect our rights or the rights of a third party, to protect the safety of any person or to prevent any illegal activity; or</li>
<li>to protect the rights, property, or safety of DontPayFull, our staff, our customers or other persons. This may include exchanging personal information with other organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
</ol>
<p>We may also disclose and use anonymised, aggregated reporting and statistics about users of our website or our goods and services for the purpose of internal reporting or reporting to our group or other third parties, and for our marketing and promotion purposes. None of these anonymised, aggregated reports or statistics will enable our users to be personally identified.</p>
<p>Save as expressly detailed above, we will never share, sell or rent any of your personal information to any third party without notifying you and, where necessary, obtaining your consent. If you have given your consent for us to use your personal information in a particular way, but later change your mind, you should contact us and we will stop doing so.</p>
<h4>How we store your information</h4>
<p>We keep your personal information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which the personal information is processed. The length of time for which we retain personal information depends on the purposes for which we collect and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws and to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights.</p>
<h4>Information Security</h4>
<p>The main risk of our processing of your personal information is if it is lost, stolen or misused. This could lead to your personal information being in the hands of someone else who may use it fraudulently or make public, information that you would prefer to keep private.</p>
<p>For this reason, DontPayFull is committed to protecting your personal information from loss, theft and misuse. We take all reasonable precautions to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, including through use of appropriate organisational and technical measures.</p>
<p>In the course of provision of your personal information to us, your personal information may be transferred over the internet. Although we make every effort to protect the personal information which you provide to us, the transmission of information over the internet is not completely secure. As such, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our website and that any such transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal information, we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access to it.</p>
<p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access your online account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
<h4>Your Rights</h4>
<p>You have certain rights in relation to your personal information. If you would like further information in relation to these or would like to exercise any of them, please contact us via email at gdpr@dontpayfull.com at any time. You have the following rights:</p>

<h4>7. Right to object.</h4>
<p>You have a right to ask us to consider any valid objections which you have to our use of your personal information where we process your personal information on the basis of our or another person's legitimate interest.</p>

Please note, however, that certain personal information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, for example if we need to keep using the information to comply with our own legal obligations or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>
<p>If an exception applies, we will tell you this when responding to your request. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to any request you make.</p>
<h4>Children</h4>
<p>Our website and services are not directed at children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>
<p>If you are a child under the age of 13 and we learn that we have inadvertently obtained personal information from you from our websites, or from any other source, then we will delete that information as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please contact us at gdpr@DontPayFull.com if you are aware that we may have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the age of 13.</p>
<h4>Marketing</h4>
<p>We may collect and use your personal information for undertaking marketing by email telephone and post.</p>
<p>We may send you certain marketing communications (including electronic marketing communications) if it is in our legitimate interests to do so for marketing and business development purposes or, if you are a sole trader or a non-limited liability partnership if you have consented to receive such electronic marketing information.</p>
<p>However, we will always obtain your consent to direct marketing communications where we are required to do so by law and if we intend to disclose your personal information to any third party for such marketing.</p>
