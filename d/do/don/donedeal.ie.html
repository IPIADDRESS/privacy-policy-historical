<h2>2. Types of Information Collected</h2>
<p>We retain two types of information:</p>
<p>"Personal Data"<br>
This is data that identifies you or can be used to identify or

voluntarily submit it to us, and is only kept for as long as it
is required for us to provide your with the requested service.</p>
<p>"Non-Personal Data"<br>
Like most websites, we gather statistical and other analytical
