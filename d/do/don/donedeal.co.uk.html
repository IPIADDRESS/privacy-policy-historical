<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>This website uses "cookies”. A cookie is a little piece of data stored by the browser on the hard drive of your computer, at the request of our server. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive.&nbsp;On revisiting DoneDeal our computer server will recognise the cookie, giving us information about your last visit. We may use cookies (including flash cookies) to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your personal preferences so you do not have to re-enter them each time you connect to the DoneDeal Website - our cookies are not available to other websites. Cookies help us to improve DoneDeal and to deliver a better and more personalised service.&nbsp;They enable us:</p>
<ol>
<li>to estimate our audience size and usage      pattern;</li>
<li>to store information about your      preferences, and so allow us to customise DoneDeal according to your      individual interests; and</li>
<li>to speed up your use of the DoneDeal      Service and searches.</li>
</ol>
<p>You are always free to decline our cookies, if your browser permits, by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. You are always free to ask your browser to indicate when a cookie is being sent. You can also delete cookie files from your computer at your discretion. Note that if you decline our cookies or ask for notification each time a cookie is being sent, this may affect your use of the DoneDeal Website. For information on how to control your cookies go to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
<p>We also participate in the Google Adsense programme and we allow Google and other third parties that participate in Google Adsense to use a type of cookie called the “DoubleClick DART” cookie also on our Website. Please note that Google is a third party and Clause 4 below applies to Google’s use of cookies via our website. Google uses cookies to serve ads to you on the Website. A persistent cookie gets entered by your web browser into the cookie folder on your computer’s hard drive. A persistentcookie remains in that cookie folder, which is maintained and governed by your web browser, after you close your browser program. The DoubleClick DART cookie is a persistent cookie used by Google in the ads served on the websites of its partners, such as websites displaying AdSense ads or participating in Google certified ad networks. The DoubleClick DART cookie consists of the name of the domain that set the cookie (“ad.doubleclick.net”), the lifetime of the cookie, and a “value.” DoubleClick’s DART technology used by Google generates a unique series of characters for the “value” portion of the cookie.</p>
<p>When you visit a Google partner's website and either view or click on an ad, a DoubleClick DART cookie may be dropped on your browser. The manner in which the “DoubleClick DART” cookie works enables Google and its partners to display ads to you on the Website and/or other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick DART used by Google. Instructions on how to opt-out are available from Google and are set out in this Google ad and content network privacy policy: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</a> and more information regarding the “DoubleClick DART cookie” please visit: <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx</a></p>
