<h3 dir="ltr">Cookies</h3>
<p dir="ltr">This website uses “cookies”. A cookie is a little piece of data stored by the browser on the hard drive of your computer, at the request of our server. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive.&nbsp;On revisiting DoneDeal our computer server will recognise the cookie, giving us information about your last visit. We may use cookies (including flash cookies) to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your personal preferences so you do not have to re-enter them each time you connect to the DoneDeal Website – our cookies are not available to other websites. Cookies help us to improve DoneDeal and to deliver a better and more personalised service.&nbsp;They enable us:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">to estimate our audience size and usage pattern;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">to store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise DoneDeal according to your individual interests; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">to speed up your use of the DoneDeal Service and searches.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">You are always free to decline our cookies, if your browser permits, by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. You are always free to ask your browser to indicate when a cookie is being sent. You can also delete cookie files from your computer at your discretion. Note that if you decline our cookies or ask for notification each time a cookie is being sent, this may affect your use of the DoneDeal Website. For information on how to control your cookies go to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We also participate in the Google Adsense programme and we allow Google and other third parties that participate in Google Adsense to use a type of cookie called the “DoubleClick DART” cookie also on our Website. Please note that Google is a third party and Clause 4 below applies to Google’s use of cookies via our website. Google uses cookies to serve ads to you on the Website. A persistent cookie gets entered by your web browser into the cookie folder on your computer’s hard drive. A persistentcookie remains in that cookie folder, which is maintained and governed by your web browser, after you close your browser program. The DoubleClick DART cookie is a persistent cookie used by Google in the ads served on the websites of its partners, such as websites displaying AdSense ads or participating in Google certified ad networks. The DoubleClick DART cookie consists of the name of the domain that set the cookie (“ad.doubleclick.net”), the lifetime of the cookie, and a “value.” DoubleClick’s DART technology used by Google generates a unique series of characters for the “value” portion of the cookie.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When you visit a Google partner’s website and either view or click on an ad, a DoubleClick DART cookie may be dropped on your browser. The manner in which the “DoubleClick DART” cookie works enables Google and its partners to display ads to you on the Website and/or other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick DART used by Google. Instructions on how to opt-out are available from Google and are set out in this Google ad and content network privacy policy: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</a> and more information regarding the “DoubleClick DART cookie” please visit: <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx</a></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">4. Disclosure of Information to Third Parties and Advertising</h2>

The third parties to whom we may provide this information may include potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising services (including website tracking services), commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the DoneDeal Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you on the DoneDeal Website or on other third party websites that you visit. Further information about the use of cookies in delivering these advertisements is contained in Clause 3 above.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We may also use such aggregate anonymised information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in the southeast of Ireland) when displaying advertisements on the DoneDeal Website.&nbsp;We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers’ wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.&nbsp;You agree to these practices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We will not disclose your personal data to third parties unless you have consented to this disclosure or unless the third party is required to fulfil your order (in such circumstances, the third party is bound by similar data protection requirements).

In such circumstances, we shall only disclose the personal data on the strict understanding that the personal data is being provided solely for use by authorised inspectors of the ISPCA, DSPCA or USPCA for the specific purposes identified to us in advance and may not be disclosed to any third parties without our prior approval. You agree that we may disclose your personal data on that basis.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We will take all reasonable steps (including appropriate technical and organisational measures) to protect your personal data that we hold in accordance with this Website Privacy Policy. However, the nature of the internet is such that we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us via the internet. No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and any transmission is at your own risk. You acknowledge that we are not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the internet and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of and related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorised manner.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the DoneDeal Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.&nbsp;We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information and agree to make that information public on the DoneDeal Website (e.g., name, telephone number) via advertisements, blog postings, tweets or in other areas of the DoneDeal Website, then that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected, correlated and used by third parties. These third parties or other website users may use your information to send you unsolicited messages. Such activities are beyond our control.

<p dir="ltr">It may be necessary to transfer your personal information to other group companies or service providers located in countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), including but not limited to the United States.&nbsp;This may happen where our servers or suppliers and service providers are based outside of the EEA or where you use our services and products while visiting countries outside of the EEA.&nbsp;The data protection and other laws of these countries may not be as comprehensive as those in Ireland or the EU but in these instances we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights are respected.&nbsp;You agree that we may transfer your personal data on that basis.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">6. Access to Information and Updating, Verifying and Deleting personal data</h2>
