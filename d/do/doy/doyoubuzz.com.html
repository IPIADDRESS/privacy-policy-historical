        We do so as it is necessary for exercising our legitimate interest of ensuring the security of our Services,
        including better protecting our community against spam, harassment, violation of intellectual property, fraud

<p class="c0">
    <span class="c2">We use your information to provide and improve our Services and products, for billing and payments, for identification
        and authentication purposes, for targeted online marketing, for contacting members or interested parties and,
        in general, for research and aggregated reporting. For example, we can discover the types of products that interest
        you through your usage behavior and, as a result, suggest possible purchases.
        <br>
    </span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
    <span class="c2">A fundamental aspect of our Services is our legitimate interest in personalizing your experience on the site, in

<p class="c0">
    <span class="c2">Legislation and security: DoYouBuzz may also retain or disclose your personal information to third parties in the
        limited following circumstances: in response to legal requests from public authorities, especially for responding
        to legitimate national security or law enforcement requirements; to protect, establish or exercise our legal
        rights or to defend ourselves against legal action, especially with respect to debt recovery; to comply with
        a subpoena, court order, court proceeding, or other legal requirement; or when we believe, in good faith, that
        a disclosure is necessary in order to comply with the law, prevent bodily injury, imminent financial loss, or
        to investigate, avoid or take action with respect to illegal activity, suspicion of fraud, threats to our property
        or violations of DoYouBuzz’s Terms of Service. In these particular cases, our use of your information may
        be necessary for the legitimate interest of a third party or ours to ensure the security of our Services, avoid
        harm or criminal activity, to assert or defend legal rights or prevent damages. This use may be necessary to
        fulfill a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise or defend legal claims. It may also be necessary for
        public interest (for example, to prevent criminal activities) or to protect vital interests (in the unlikely
        event that we would have to share information to save lives or avoid bodily injury).
        <br>
    </span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
    <span class="c2">If DoYouBuzz receives a legitimate and justified request to provide a member’s records or information on them
        in any of the limited circumstances described in the above paragraph, DoYouBuzz may disclose such personal information
        which may include, but is not limited to, the member’s name, physical address, telephone number, email
        address and company name.
        <br>
    </span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
    <span class="c2">Aggregate information: DoYouBuzz may share demographic information with commercial or institutional partners, but
        it will be grouped and de-personalized so as not to reveal any personally identifiable information.
        <br>
    </span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
    <span class="c2">Service providers: DoYouBuzz may also engage third-party companies and individuals (for example, companies responsible
        for the processing of payments, consulting firms, analytics and security providers) to assist us in the execution,
        provision, and sale of our Services. These third parties have limited access to your information, can only use
        it for performing tasks on our behalf, and are obligated to DoYouBuzz to not disclose or use your information
        for other purposes. Engaging service providers is often necessary to provide you with Services, especially when
        these companies play an important role, such as processing payments and shipments and helping us to ensure the
        operation and security of our Services. In other cases, these service providers are not strictly necessary for
        us to provide our Services to you, but instead help us to improve them by helping us to, for example, research
        how we can better serve our users. In these latter cases, we have a legitimate interest in working with service
        providers in order to improve our Services.

        For these reasons, when you modify or delete your information, not all the data is immediately removed from all
        our backups (note, however, that they are thoroughly removed from the production environment, which means that
