    <ul type="disc">
      <li>You      can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result      in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such      information may be required in order for you to register as a member;      purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion,      survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on      our website.</li>
      <li>At      any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional      emails from us by sending your opt-out request to <a href="mailto:support@DownToEarth.com">support@DownToEarth.com</a> . When you register on our      website, you will be given a choice as to whether you want to receive      e-mail messages about special offers. You may modify your choice during      registration on the registration page, or later by sending your opt-out      request to <a href="mailto:support@DownToEarth.com">support@DownToEarth.com</a>. You also will be given the      opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of      receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to      process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional      and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements,      administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity      to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in      your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email      communications will only affect future activities or communications from      us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as      a service provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated      your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with      that third party.</li>
      <li>You      may tell us not to share your personal information with third parties or      the IAC family of companies for direct marketing purposes by checking the      appropriate opt-out selection at the time you register on our site, or by sending      your opt-out request to <a href="mailto:support@DownToEarth.com">support@DownToEarth.com</a> after you have registered.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>In certain places on our site we may ask for your phone number. In those places where we ask for your phone number, we will always tell you how your phone number will be used � either to provide you a service you requested from us or to call you to inform you about one of our products in which you have expressed an interest. We will not call you for marketing purposes unless you provide us your phone number specifically to receive such calls. If you have previously provided us your phone number but no longer wish to be contacted by phone by us, you can send your request to <a href="mailto:support@DownToEarth.com">support@DownToEarth.com</a> . Under our Do Not Call policy you may instruct us not to call you for marketing purposes by informing anyone who contacts you by phone in our behalf that you do not wish to receive marketing calls from us. You can also instruct us at any time not to call you for marketing purposes by sending your request to <a href="mailto:support@DownToEarth.com">support@DownToEarth.com</a>]. We will implement your instructions as soon as possible, and in no event later 30 days after receiving your instructions. We have policies and procedures in place and train our employees to honor your request. Please note that we may still need to call you for servicing or other non-marketing purposes. </li>

    <p><strong><a name="security" id="security"></a>How we protect your personal information</strong> <br>
      We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use SSL encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information. <br>
      We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft. </p>
    <p><strong>Information you provide about yourself while using our service</strong> <br>
      We provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others or upload content such as photographs. Such postings are governed by our <a href="http://www.downtoearth/help/terms.aspx">Terms of Use</a>. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. </p>
    <p><strong>Children's privacy</strong> <br>
      Although our website is a general audience site, we restrict the use of our service to individuals age 18 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18. </p>
