<p>Company and all its related web sites Privacy Policy PLEASE NOTE:  OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE  UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR  SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. COMPANY DOES NOT PROVIDE  NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT  THIS WEB SITE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY  PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR  PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES REFERRED TO IN THIS  PRIVACY POLICY. The information collection, use, and dissemination  practices of company. This policy applies to company’s collection, use,  storage and disclosure of information by company on its (a) websites,  including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies  (collectively, the “Websites”), (b) on various third party websites, and  (c) to company’s other information collection, including the purchase  of customer lists from third parties. Company is not responsible for the  information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or  applications.</p>
<p>1. Collection of Information.</p>
<p>1.1 Survey Information.

(As used herein, “online” means using the  Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and  “offline” means by methods other than online, including in person, in  the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar  means.) In the Surveys we may ask an individual to provide various  information to company, which may include his or her name, email  address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell  phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education  and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment  information, personal and online interests, and such other information  as may be requested from time to time (together, “Survey Information”).

<p>(b) New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, including  cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is company’s use of new  and evolving technology. As a result, company strongly encourages  individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of  technology.</p>

<p>1.4 Individual Information. As used herein, Individual Information  means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other  Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any  other information Company gathers or receives about individuals.</p>

This information helps Company  to better understand the online habits of individuals so that Company  can target advertising and promotions to them.</p>
<p>2.6 Profiles of Individuals. Company uses Individual Information to  make a profile of an individual. A profile can be created by combining  Survey Information and Third Party List Information with other sources  of Individual Information such as information obtained from public  databases.</p>

Our computers have security measures  (such as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and  alteration of the information under Company control. Notwithstanding  such measures, Company cannot guarantee that its security measures will  prevent Company computers from being illegally accessed, and the  Individual Information on them stolen or altered.</p>
