We collect the personal information you knowingly provide by completing an online form, registering for information or services, applying for a job, or otherwise sending to us. For example, if you sign up to receive e-mail communications from one of our businesses, we collect your e-mail address and any related information you provide. If you communicate with us using the “Contact Us” feature, we collect the information you provide when you complete the “Contact Us” form.</span></p>

From time to time or where applicable, we may supplement the information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address, information based on your zip code or business, or information that we have based upon your relationship with Dow. For example, if you are a Dow customer or supplier, we may supplement the information you provide online with information you provide through your business relationship with Dow. In addition, where a user has separately opted-in to receive information from Dow through its marketing automation platform, Eloqua (a product of Oracle Corporation), that information may be shared with other digital tools to enhance a user’s overall experience with Dow web properties. </span></p>

<h3 id="3"><strong>Location of Information</strong></h3>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: #111111;">Dow is a global organization with its corporate headquarters in the United States. Our servers, databases, and service providers are located in the United States and in other countries. Different countries have different privacy laws and requirements, and some, including the United States, may provide less legal protection for your personal information than others. By using this site, you are consenting to the collection, use and transfer of your personal information in or to the United States or other countries for the purposes described in this Online Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<h3 id="4"><strong>Use of Special Features or Areas of Our Website</strong></h3>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: #111111;">Some of our websites include special features, such as surveys, licensed content; or an online store; or password protected areas, such as a customers-only area or a careers area. This Online Privacy Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by privacy statements that are specific to and appear on individual Dow websites, including but not limited to our investor and career sites. Generally, these statements provide details about the personal information we collect or do not collect on particular pages or areas of a website, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the use of that information.</span></p>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: #111111;">When you sign up to use a special feature or password-protected area, you may be asked to agree to special terms governing your use of the special feature or password-protected area. In such cases, you will be asked to expressly consent to the special terms, for example, by checking a box or clicking on a button marked “I agree.” This type of agreement is known as a “click-through” agreement. If any of the terms of a click-through agreement or another agreement between you and Dow are different than the terms of this Online Privacy Policy, the terms of that agreement will govern over this Online Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<h3 id="5"><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></h3>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: #111111;">We do not knowingly collect information from children to sell or promote our products or services. We host educational programs in science for students and teachers in our communities, but we do not invite minors to contact us or manually provide personal information. Visitors must be 18 years of age or older to submit registration or survey information. Parents or legal guardians may register to obtain information or participate in a survey on behalf of their children. If you believe a child under the age of eighteen has sent personal contact information to Dow, please&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.dow.com/en-us/contact-us" target="_blank"><span style="background: none 0% 0% repeat scroll white; text-decoration: none; color: #e80033;">contact us</span></a><span style="color: #111111;">&nbsp;immediately at the address listed below and we will use reasonable efforts to promptly remove that information from our databases.</span></p>
<h3 id="6"><strong>Security</strong></h3>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: #111111;">We take commercially reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of your personal information. We urge users to be careful with personal information while using the Internet.</span></p>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><em><span style="color: #111111;">SSL Protection</span></em><span style="color: #111111;">. Some password-protected areas of our website, require that a secure connection between your computer and our server be established. We use an encryption technology called Secure Socket Layers (SSL). A secure connection is maintained until you leave the secure area of the site. Although we use SSL encryption to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information as it travels over the Internet, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet and we cannot guarantee the safety of transmitting personal information over the Internet.</span></p>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><em><span style="color: #111111;">Password Protection</span></em><span style="color: #111111;">. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your passwords. We have the right to assume that anyone accessing one of our websites using a password assigned to you has the right to do so. You will be solely responsible for the activities of anyone accessing our website using a password assigned to you, even if the individual is not, in fact authorized by you. If you have reason to believe that your password has been compromised or used without authorization, you must promptly change it using the functionality provided on the site.</span></p>
<h3 id="7"><strong>External Links</strong></h3>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: #111111;">Some of our websites may contain links to other websites on the Internet that are not under the control of or maintained by Dow. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Dow of those websites, the content displayed, or the persons or entities associated with them. By visiting a linked website from a Dow website, you acknowledge that Dow is providing these links to you only as a convenience and you agree that Dow is not responsible for the content of such websites. External sites are governed by their own terms and policies and are not governed by Dow's Online Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Accessibility Statement, or other terms and policies.</span></p>

As we add new features and functionality to our websites or Dow policies or applicable laws evolve, we may need to update or revise this Online Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to do so, at any time and without prior notice, by posting a revised version on our website. These changes will be effective as of the date we post a revised version on our website.

If you wish to access, update or correct other personal information, please contact us. We will contact you and may ask you for additional information to verify your identity.
