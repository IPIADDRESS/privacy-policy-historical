We use GUIDs to track installations and to enable features and functionality for specific customers who subscribe to our Products and Services. We do not tie the information gathered by GUIDs to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.

<br><br>Software Information. We employ a technology that allows us to determine the operating systems you are using and to view your computer’s registry. Software installed on your computer has unique registry keys. By viewing your registry, we are able to detect whether you have a compatible operating system, compatible versions of DirectX, and Flash Player installed.

<br><br>How We Use Your Information

Should you have any questions or concerns, or if you would like to discontinue receiving Offers, simply email us at webmaster@downloadster.net and ask us to remove you from our lists.

<br><br>Testimonials. We post testimonials on our Sites. Testimonials may contain Personally Identifiable Information. We will obtain your consent via email prior to posting the testimonial or comment.

<br><br>Third Parties and Advertising. Third parties advertise on our Sites, and we also contract with third parties to serve ads across the Internet. These third parties may serve ads about our products or services, or third party products or services in which, based on your Session Data, we or our business partners believe you may be interested. These third parties may seek to use cookies and pixel tags, including those collected on our Site, to track Session Data about the ads you have seen and types of things in which you appear interested. These third parties may also use combined information about your visits to our Site and other sites in order to provide advertisements about related goods and services that may be of interest to you. You can opt-out of the third party advertising program by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative website http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp. Opting out of a network does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns.

<br><br>When you click on a third party advertisers’ link from our Site, you will enter the third party’s site. We are not responsible for such third party’s sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other site you visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to that site, and may be very different from our policy.

<br><br>How We Share Your Information.
Partners may sponsor Offers or we may co-sponsor an Offer with a Partner through the software. You should always assume data collected when you fill-in an Offer will be shared with a Partner. If an Offer requires you to leave our websites, you should know that our Partners may collect Personally Identifiable Information about you. We do not control these Partner sites. This Privacy Policy does not cover our partners’ websites and information practices. Once you have voluntarily submitted information to our Partners, your personal information is subject to their privacy policy. We have no liability or responsibility for these privacy policies or the use of any Personally Identifiable Information transferred to Partners.

<br><br>If you no longer wish to be contacted by our partners you must contact that partner directly to opt-out.

<br><br>Our Partners change from time to time, and therefore it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list. We strive to select trustworthy Partners who offer high quality products or services of interest to you. If you are unhappy with one of our Partners, tell us by e-mailing us at info@downloadster.net.

<br><br>We may periodically use third parties to meet your needs. If we hire a third-party service provider, they will be prohibited from using your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose not enumerated in this section.

<br><br>The following describes some of the ways that we may disclose your information to our Partners:

<br><br>Search Partners. We may transmit your search queries (made on the Site or within one of our Software Offers) to search Partners, who use this information to provide us with search results, which we then will display to you.

<br><br>Third-Party Advertisements and Software. When you request or submit your information online to a Partner in response to any Offer, we transfer your information for each request made to that Partner.

<br><br>Our Products. We do not require you to provide Personally Identifiable Information during the installation process of our Toolbars of other software products. However, when you use these Software Offers to access Download Offers (e.g. games) you may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information. In addition, we will show you Offers during the installation process.

<br><br>E-Mail Suppression Lists. We may disclose a user’s e-mail address as part of a suppression file or do-not-e-mail list to its partners and affiliates to make sure that a user’s unsubscribe requests are forwarded to the appropriate parties to ensure removal of the user from partner and affiliate databases in compliance with law, including without limitation, the Can-Spam Act of 2003.

<br><br>Sale, Merger or Asset Transfer. We may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that we or all of our assets are acquired, customer information, including any information collected through the Sites or the Services would be one of the transferred assets.

<br><br>From time to time we use third-parties when providing Services to you. We will only share information with third-parties necessary for them to provide the Services you have requested. Third-parties are prohibited from using your Personally Identifiable Information for promotional purposes.

<br><br>Your Choices

If you do not wish to receive e-mail from us, you can tell us by e-mailing us at info@downloadster.net. Be sure to include your full name and address, along with the information you submitted during your initial registration including postal address and e-mail, and tell us that you no longer wish to receive Offers from us.
