<p>Effective September 15, 2014, the AOL Terms of Service and Privacy Policy were updated. We hope you'll read the full Updated <a href="http://privacy.aol.com/updated_policy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="http://legal.aol.com/updated_tos">Terms of Service</a>. Los <a href="http://legal.aol.com/updated_terminos">términos de servicio</a> y <a href="http://privacy.aol.com/updated_privacidad">política de privacidad</a> actualizados también están disponibles en español.</p>

<h2>Questions Related to our Privacy Policy Updates</h2>

<div class="row"><a class="hide" href="#hide1" id="hide1">Why is AOL updating its privacy policy?</a> <a class="show" href="#show1" id="show1">Why is AOL updating its privacy policy?</a>

<div class="list">
<ul>
	<li>The updates to our privacy policy are designed to provide more details about our practices and to improve the overall readability of the policy. A lot has changed about AOL in the last few years. We're still among the world's best-known email and instant-messaging providers, but we're also now the owner of some of the world's best known content brands, including The Huffington Post and TechCrunch. In addition, our industry-leading advertising services also have continued to grow, and we've acquired companies such as Adap.tv to help provide more effective ads on and off AOL's websites and apps. The updates to the privacy policy are mainly meant to reflect AOL's business in 2014. That's why one of the key updates is the examples we provide that reference our different offerings.</li>
</ul>

<div class="row"><a class="hide" href="#hide2" id="hide2">What are the privacy updates users should be aware of?</a> <a class="show" href="#show2" id="show2">What are the privacy updates users should be aware of?</a>

<div class="list">
<ul>
	<li>As noted above, our updates to the Privacy Policy are designed to provide more details about our practices and to improve the overall readability of the policy. Key updates include: Definitions of important terms, such as "personal information" and "non-personally identifiable" information. As always, we do not rent or sell your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes. But we may share non-personally identifiable information with business partners, who may use that information for their own purposes.</li>
	<li>As noted above, AOL is made up of some of the world's most popular online services, including AOL.com, The Huffington Post, TechCrunch, and Mapquest. We also operate some of the industry's best-known advertising services, including Adap.tv and Advertising.com. The revised Privacy Policy explains how information may be shared among AOL's businesses and provides details about those businesses.</li>
	<li>Advertising is a core part of AOL's business. Many of our free services are supported by the ads we display on those services, and we also provide a variety of online advertising services to other companies that want to place ads on our services and elsewhere. The revised Privacy Policy includes more information about advertising on AOL, such as how we use cookies, beacons and other technologies to provide relevant ads, the other businesses that help us provide ads, and the way we measure the effectiveness of advertising.</li>
	<li>We also have added information required by a recently amended California law. This information includes how AOL treats so-called "do not track" signals.</li>
	<li>We've also revised the Privacy Policy so that it covers certain AOL services that previously had their own privacy policies. These include services, such as The Huffington Post, that have become part of AOL in the last few years, as well as a number of AOL's advertising services. The new Policy will replace the privacy policies on those services.</li>

<div class="list">
<ul>
	<li>This privacy policy covers the collection and use of information from any device used to access or connect to AOL branded websites, services, and software, as well as many websites owned by or affiliated with AOL and operating under different names. This policy does not apply to information about you collected by third party websites and offerings linked to or otherwise accessible from AOL, which is subject to their own privacy policies.</li>

<ul>
	<li>AOL may share your personal information in limited circumstances, including when we have your consent to do so or when sharing is necessary to protect AOL or comply with the law.

<div class="list">
<ul>
	<li>AOL uses information to operate and improve our services, fulfill your requests, and communicate with you, conduct research, and personalize content and ads provided to you. Often, an ad you see online is customized based on the content of the site. For example, you may see sports-related ads on a sports site. We may also select an ad based on our knowledge of the audience we think may be looking at that page. This is often done with publicly available and/or aggregated demographic information, or it may be done with analysis of the aggregated traffic on a particular website, or by using the registration data or other household data you have provided or that we have acquired from other companies.</li>

<div class="list">
<ul>
	<li>In addition to customizing advertisements for you based on the subject matter of the page you are visiting, demographic data, or information you have already provided to AOL, some ads may be targeted based on your activity on sites in the AOL Advertising Network. When you visit these sites, you may receive a "cookie" that helps us note, in an anonymized way, that your browser visited that site. AOL Advertising may use information about your activity on the AOL Advertising Network to display ads that are more relevant. Note that the information shared with the advertising network is always with a unique identifier, not personally identifiable information, such as your name or email address. Our <a href="http://advertising.aol.com/advisibility">AdVisibility Profile Viewer</a> allows you to see how the information we collect about your visits within the AOL Advertising Network are categorized into the interest segments used to select the ads displayed. You can also <a href="http://aboutads.info/choices">opt out</a> of targeted ads. Please note that you will still receive ads; however, they will no longer be tailored based on your activities.</li>

<ul>
	<li>AOL provides you with access to your registration information, any billing or shipping information, the ability to edit your information at <a href="http://about.aol.com/aolnetwork/my_account">My Account</a>, as well as the ability to cancel AOL fee-based services. Visit <a href="http://marketingpreferences.aol.com">AOL Marketing Preferences</a> to make choices about how your information may be used to provide marketing offers to you. Please note that these preferences do not apply to communications that are directly related to your registration with AOL or the fulfillment of a specific transaction you have requested (for example, a service advisory from AOL or an acknowledgment of a purchase). Visit <a href="http://privacy.aol.com/updated_advertising">AOL Advertising and Privacy</a> to learn more about online advertising and your related choices.

<div class="list">
<ul>
	<li>Some web browsers may transmit "Do Not Track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. Currently, there is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals and AOL currently does not take action in response to these signals.</li>
	<li>Previously, Gravity provided users with the ability to use the browser "Do Not Track" signal to opt out of certain personalization. AOL has consolidated and simplified many of the preferences and opt-outs we offer, and as a result, "Do Not Track" browser signals will no longer be recognized. You can still opt-out of Gravity personalization using the cookie-based opt-out available on the <a href="http://www.gravity.com/consumers/">Gravity website</a> and this opt-out is also now part of the AOL Advertising opt-out available on various industry opt-out pages, such as <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">The Network Advertising Initiative</a> and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">The Digital Advertising Alliance</a>. Effective September 15, 2014, Gravity will only disable personalization in response to these opt-out cookies. If and when a standard for responding to browser "Do Not Track" signals is established, we may revisit our policy on responding to these signals.</li>

<ul>
	<li>AOL's Terms of Service now includes a binding arbitration clause and class action waiver. AOL's arbitration clause can be found in our Terms of Service in the section entitled "How to resolve disputes with us."</li>

<div class="list">
<ul>
	<li>Arbitration is a more informal way of resolving legal disputes than going to court. Cases are decided by an impartial, independent arbitrator, who can award individual damages just as a court could. Arbitration is typically faster and more efficient than court. Arbitrations with AOL will be administered by the American Arbitration Association.</li>

	<li>A "Notice of Dispute" is a form on which you provide your contact information, your AOL user ID, the facts regarding your Dispute, and the relief you are requesting from us. You can get a Notice of Dispute form by clicking <a href="http://legal.aol.com/notice_of_dispute">here</a>. We will respond to a Notice of Dispute in writing within 60 days after we receive it.

<ul>
	<li>To start the arbitration process, you must first file a Notice of Dispute with us. If, after 60 days, the dispute has not been resolved to your satisfaction, you may initiate arbitration by completing a Demand for Arbitration form, available by clicking <a href="http://legal.aol.com/arbitration">here</a>.

	<li>In most cases, there will be no cost to you. If your claim in arbitration is $75,000 or less, we will pay your filing fees, as well as other AAA and arbitrator's fees and expenses. If you initiate an arbitration involving more than $75,000, the AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA's and arbitrator's fees and expenses.
