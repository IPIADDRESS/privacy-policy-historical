		<li>If You contact Us, We may keep a record of that correspondence.</li>

	<h3>Cookies</h3>
	<p>We may use cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of Your computer, to keep track of Your activity and any transactions on the Site and to enhance Your experience on the Site. We may also use cookies to deliver content specific to Your interests, to save Your passwords, and if You choose, to save other personal and financial information so You do not have to re-enter it each time You visit the Site. Please note that third party advertisers and Our partners may place or read cookies on Your browser.  You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting in Your browser which allows You to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if You set Your browser to refuse cookies, You may not be able to access certain areas on Our Site and may have a restricted experience.</p>

	<h3>Information Other Websites Collect From You</h3>
