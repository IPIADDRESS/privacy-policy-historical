Protecting your privacy 
				DomainBrokers.com takes all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of our customers and ensure that the personal information we collect is not ordinarily disclosed to third parties without the customer's consent. 
				However, there may be times when DomainBrokers.com may be required to disclose personal information of a customer without their express consent. This may occur where we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against the customer or another person who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights or property of DomainBrokers.com or its associates, affiliates, other customers or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; or required by law. </p>
				<p>WHY WE NEED TO OBTAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU<br>
				Your personal information is used to enable us to deliver our online products and services to you.

				Your email address and other personal information may be used to enable us to send you marketing or promotional material (such as promotional offers) on other products and services that we consider may be of interest to you. However, you may at any time, notify us that you do not wish to receive this material via an "opt-out" facility contained on our websites.

				DomainBrokers.com also shares collective information about our users (on an anonymous basis) with our advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we may disclose the fact that membership to one of our websites is "X" percent male and "Y" percent female. </p>
				<p>This data is used to gain a better understanding of our customer base, thus enabling us to tailor our website content to our customers specific wants and needs. </p>

				</p><p>Use of IP Addresses <br>
				An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, (the big computers that "serve up" Web pages) automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 
				We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When guests request pages from our sites, our servers may log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others. 
				Some services provided by DomainBrokers.com, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. Please review each service prior to use and only uses those that disclose information you are comfortable with sharing. </p>

				By showing how and when guests use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our users needs. </p>
				<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.

It can be used to count the number of visitors to our sites and gather information and develop profiles about people who visit our site and/or click on links on our sites. Such devices are also known as 'invisible' or '1-by-1' GIFs due to their incredibly small size which usually cannot be detected. </p>
				<p>We use web bugs on our websites to track both the source and destination of visitors to our sites. This is required for proper accounting and reporting requirements of our affiliate program as well as to help us to provide our visitors with what they want to see and do online.
