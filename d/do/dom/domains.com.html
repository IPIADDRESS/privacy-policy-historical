<h2>Every Domain Name Creates a Public Record</h2>

Register4less will not, under any circumstance give away or sell its
customer's personal information to any company, organization, or individual.  Information
provided by you is used solely to register your domain.

<h3><locale>2. Use of Client Supplied Information:</locale></h3>

The information you supply will be used solely to register/transfer the

Register4less will never send any kind of publicity-oriented messages 
in electronic form to any of its customers. We will not give away, sell or expose 
any customer e-mail address under any circumstance.
</locale></div><br>

affiliates from such practices.  Any affiliate who engages in the use of SPAM to promote
their affiliate business is subject to having their affiliate account terminated.

domain name registration period nears expiration.

All communication between you and Register4less during the domain name registration 
process is encrypted and secure.  Throughout the register4less web site, once you have either logged 
into our site or are creating a new profile, you will have entered into the secure zone of the web 
site, and all communication from that point until you finish your transaction is encrypted and secure.</locale></div>

In processing your purchase, Register4less.com uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted communication 
protocols for all purchase transactions.   Once your domain has been purchased, Register4less does
