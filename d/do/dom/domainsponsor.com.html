	<p>
	  <u>Third Party List Information.</u>  &nbsp;We may also obtain both personal and non-personal information about  you from third party data gathering sources. &nbsp;We may match this  third-party collected information with the personal information that you  provide to us.

	<p><u>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information Collection Technology.</u>  We and our business partners, such as advertisers, may use various  technologies to collect information from your computer and about your  activities on the Site. For example, we and our business partners may  collect and store non-personally identifying information through  technologies such as cookies, log files, clear gifs (also known as web  beacons), and other technologies to help determine user viewing  preferences for advertising and other purposes. &nbsp;
</p>
	<ul>

</p>
<ul>
  <li>Service  providers: We may share your personal information, alone or in  combination with non-personal information, with third party service  providers in connection with the Services we provide or your request for  customer service on the Site.

In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal  objection or right available to us in our sole discretion. In addition,  we may disclose your information when we believe it is appropriate in  connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action  regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to  protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our  users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or  cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce the Site terms of use or  other agreements or policies.</li>

	<p>
	Please  note that our Privacy Policy does not cover any third party's use or  handling of your information once it is shared. Rather, the privacy  policies of the various third parties will govern.

To opt-out of  communications from our third party business partners, please contact  them directly.</p>
