   1ASPHOST PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong><p></p>
 <p>This Privacy Statement discloses the privacy
   practices for 1asphost.com ("1ASPHost", "We"
   or "Us") and how it treats the information that 1ASPHost   collects and receives, including information related to your past
   use of 1ASPHost products and services. This policy does not apply to
   the practices of companies that 1ASPHost does not own or control, or
   to people that 1ASPHost does
 not employ or manage.</p>

 <p>1. The information collected by 1ASPHost.<br>
   2. Communications from 1ASPHost<br>
   3. How information collected by 1ASPHost is used.<br>
   4. Correction/Updating Personal Information<br>
   5. Opting Out<br>
   6. Terminated 1ASPHost Accounts<br>

   7. Use of the 1ASPHost Website by Persons Under Age 13<br>
   8. Linking to Third Party Websites<br>
   9. Users Must Keep Their Passwords Private<br>
   10. Changes to Our Privacy Statement<br>
   11. Final Statement</p>
 <p>1	Information Collected by 1ASPHost<br>

   We will not knowingly use information collected on this website to
   others in ways different from what is disclosed in this
   statement. 1ASPHost collects information from our users at several
   different points on our website. </p>
 <p>For purposes of this Privacy Statement, "Personally
   Identifiable Information" refers to information that can
   directly identify an individual; for example, such information may
   include an individual's name, mailing address, phone number or
   email address.</p>
 <p>1.1	Information that Is Automatically Collected<br>
     We use IP addresses, with the help of a business partner, to
     analyze trends, administer the website, track users'
     movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate
     use. IP addresses are not linked to Personally Identifiable
     Information. </p>

 <p>1.2	Information that Is Collected by Cookies<br>
     A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's hard drive
     containing information about that user. By setting a cookie on
     our website, the user would not have to log in with a password
     more than once, thereby saving time while on our website. If a
     user rejects the cookie, they may still use our website. The only
     drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas
     of our website. Cookies can also enable us to track and target
     the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our
     website. Some of our business partners use cookies on our website
     (for example, advertisers); however, we have no access to or
     control over these cookies. </p>
 <p>1.3 Information that Is Actively Submitted to
   1ASPHost<br> Registrations and Orders. In order to register a domain
   name or order services from this website, a user must create an
   account and complete a registration process. During the account
   creation process, a user must provide contact information (such as
   name and email address) so that we can stay in touch with our
   users. This information is also used to fulfill order and
   registration requests. To pay for a domain name registration or for
   other service ordered, a user must provide contact information
   (such as name and shipping address) and financial information (such
   as a credit card number and its expiration date).  This information
   is used for billing purposes, with the help of our business
   partner, and to fill users' orders. If we have trouble
   processing an order, this contact information is used to get in
   touch with the user. </p>
 <p>Tell-A-Friend. If a user elects to use our referral
   service for informing a friend about our website, we ask them for
   the friend's name and email address.  We will automatically send
   the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the website. We
   store this information for the purpose of sending this one-time
   email. The friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:acquisition4@mailca.custhelp.com">acquisition4@mailca.custhelp.com</a>
    or go directly to <a href="https://secure.registerapi.com/resell.php?goto=support&amp;siteid=35465" target="_blank">https://secure.registerapi.com/resell.php?goto=support&amp;siteid=35465</a>
   to request the removal of this information from this database. </p>
 <p>1.4	Third Party Advertisers on 1ASPHost's Website<br>
   We use third-party advertising companies to serve
     ads (using methods that include Pixel Tags and Clear Gifs) when
     you visit our website.  Third-party advertising companies also
     separately place or recognize a cookie file on your browser in
     the course of delivering advertisements to this website. These
     companies may use information (not including your name, address,
     email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and
     other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and
     services of interest to you. </p>
 <p>1.5	Information 1ASPHost Obtains from Third Parties<br>
   Supplemental Information Collected. In certain
     circumstances, in order for our website to properly fulfill its
     obligation to our users, it is necessary for us to supplement the
     information we receive with information from third party
     sources. For example, to determine if our users qualify for a
     dotPartner account, we use their name and business information to
     request a credit report. </p>
 <p>1ASPHost Accounts Created by a Third Party on
   Your Behalf. If you received your domain name from someone else,
   without registering for it yourself, your domain name may belong to
   a "managed domain." In a managed domain, the
   administrator of a company with whom you have a business
   relationship (for example, your ISP) can create your domain name
   for you. You can then use the domain name like any other domain
   name. The administrator, however, has access to the domain name and
   can edit your 1ASPHost profile, reset your password, and manage the
   1ASPHost account without your additional consent. In addition to the
   terms mentioned in this Privacy Statement, an account created by a
   third party allows any of your Personally Identifiable Information
   within that account to be available to that third party as if they
   were you. We have no access to or control over the third party to
   prevent their disclosure of your information. </p>
 <p>2	Communications from 1ASPHost<br>
   Welcome Emails and General Correspondence. We
     send a welcoming email to the email address associated with the
     account a user has created to verify the users password and
     username.  This process is designed to prevent e-mail addresses
     from being used without permission in the creation of a 1ASPHost     account. Established users will occasionally receive information
     on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of
     respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not
     receive some of these types of communications. Please see our
     opt-out options below. </p>
 <p>Site and Service Updates. We send the user website
   and service announcement updates. Users are not permitted to
   unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important
   information about the website and/or service. We may communicate
   with users to provide services that users request or to discuss
   issues relating to their account. </p>

 <p>Surveys &amp; Contests. From time-to-time our
   website requests information from users via surveys or
   contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely
   voluntary and, as such, the user has a choice whether or not to
   disclose this information. Information requested may include
   contact information (such as name and shipping address), and
   demographic information (such as zip code, age level). </p>
 <p>3	How Information Collected by 1ASPHost Is Used<br>
   Demographic Information. We will share aggregated
     demographic information with our partners and advertisers. The
     aggregated demographic information is not linked to any
     Personally Identifiable Information that can identify any
     individual person. </p>
 <p>Communicating with Our Users. We use Personally
   Identifiable Information (such as your name, telephone number or
   email address) to communicate with our users when they have
   questions, concerns or comments about their accounts or the
   services that we provide. If you contact us, we may or may not
   delete your emails or voicemails to us. </p>
 <p>Information Shared With Third Parties. We share
   information with third parties as required by ICANN and in order to
   give our customers access to a great variety of
   services. Specifically, we may do the following: <br>

   · Submit the name, postal address, e-mail address, and phone
   numbers associated with the registrant, administrative, technical
   and billing contacts of a domain name to the appropriate Registry
   or registration database. This information is included in a
   publicly available 'Whois' database, in accordance with ICANN
   rules. This sharing of information is required by ICANN rules.<br>
 · 
   Use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and
   services. These companies do not use Personally Identifiable
   Information for any use other than credit card processing; however,
   we will not be responsible or liable for use of the information
   required by credit card companies in contravention of their
   policies, contractual obligations or general good business
   procedures. <br>
 · 
   Partner with third parties who provide services to our users. When
   the user signs up for or agrees to receive a specific service
   provided by the third party (i.e. PostMasterDirect advertisements),
   we share the information that is needed for the third party to
   provide the services. <br>
 · 
   Share the publicly available domain contact information submitted
   by our users for inclusion in the Whois database with third
   parties. We do not control the use of this Personally Identifiable
   Information by third parties.<br>
 · 
   Share your Personally Identifiable Information with other entities
   that are owned by 1ASPHost, that own 1ASPHost, or have some sort of
   corporate ownership relationship with 1ASPHost. </p>

 <p>Addressing Legal Issues. Further, we provide
   Personally Identifiable Information to respond to subpoenas, court
   orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal
   rights or defend against legal claims. Further, we believe it is
   necessary to share Personally Identifiable Information in order to
   investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,
   suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the
   physical safety of any person, violations of 1ASPHost's terms of
   use, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
 <p>Sale or Transfer of 1ASPHost. If all or a portion
   of 1ASPHost is transferred, sold, merged, ceases operations, goes
   bankrupt, or is otherwise involved in a transaction where the
   ownership or management of 1ASPHost is changed (individually or
   collectively, a "Transaction") then your Personally
   Identifiable Information or other user information may be
   transferred or assigned to a third party as part of the
   Transaction. </p>
 <p>4 Correction/Updating Personal Information<br>
   Users must provide accurate and correct contact
     information (name, postal address, e-mail address, phone number)
     for their domain name(s) Registrant, Administrative, Technical
     and Billing contacts, which will be listed in a publicly
     accessible 'Whois' database, in compliance with ICANN rules. If a
     user's Personally Identifiable Information changes (such as a zip
     code), or if a user no longer desires 1ASPHost's services, we will
     provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal
     data provided to us. This can usually be done under online
     account management (on your own) or by emailing our user Support
     Group for assistance.</p>
 <p>5	Opting Out<br>
   Users are provided an opportunity to "opt-out" of
   having their information used for purposes not directly related to
   the services they request.  Users who no longer wish to receive our
   newsletter or promotional materials from us may opt-out of
   receiving these communications by replying and typing
   "unsubscribe" in the subject line in the email or email
   your request to <a href="mailto:acquisition4@mailca.custhelp.com">acquisition4@mailca.custhelp.com</a>
.</p>                        
 <p>6	Terminated 1ASPHost Accounts<br>
    If your 1ASPHost account is terminated or cancelled (regardless of
    whether it was voluntary), all of your Personally Identifiable
    Information will remain on our servers. We retain and use your
    Personally Identifiable Information as necessary to enforce our
    policies or to address contractual issues, and may contact you for
    future marketing or promotional purposes. </p>

 <p>7 Use of the 1ASPHost Website by Persons Under
   Age 13<br> This website is not intended for use by anyone under the
   age of thirteen (13), and any individual under such age should not
   provide us with Personally Identifiable Information. We do not
   knowingly contact, market to, solicit, collect or use Personally
   Identifiable Information from or about any individual under the age
   of 13. It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive
   information pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of
   that we have personal information regarding a person under the age
   of 13, as soon as we reasonably verify the information, we will
   either obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information
   from the account and/or service. However, the information may
   remain on a log in our servers.  If you want to notify us of our
   receipt of information by children under 13, please do so by
   emailing us at: <a href="mailto:acquisition4@mailca.custhelp.com">acquisition4@mailca.custhelp.com</a>.</p>
 <p>8	Linking to Third Party Websites<br>
   This website contains links to other websites.
     Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy
     practices of such other websites.  We encourage our users to be
     aware when they leave our website and to read the Privacy
     Statements of each and every website that collects Personally
     Identifiable Information. This Privacy Statement applies solely
     to information collected by this website. </p>
 <p>9	Users Must Keep Their Passwords Private<br>
   Users are required to keep their account passwords
     confidential and to not share this information with others. If
     you choose to reveal or share your password and 1ASPHost account
     name, we are unable to guarantee the security of your
     account. </p>
 <p>10	Changes to Our Privacy Statement<br>
   This Privacy Statement may change, and use of
     information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy
     Statement that is in effect as of the time of use. You are
     responsible for periodically checking our Privacy Statement.  You
     may opt-out of any posted change to our collection, use or
     disclosure of your personal information by sending an e-mail to
     <a href="mailto:acquisition4@mailca.custhelp.com">acquisition4@mailca.custhelp.com</a>.
     If we make minor changes to this Privacy Statement, the changes
     will be immediately effective upon posting the revised Privacy
     Statement to the website. If we make material changes to this
     Privacy Statement or in how we will use or collect your
     Personally Identifiable Information, we will prominently post a
     notification on our website of the changed Privacy Statement ten
     (10) days prior to implementing the change.  The date at the
     bottom of this Privacy Statement is the date that the Privacy
     Statement is effective.</p>

 <p>11	Final Statement<br>
   1ASPHost will use your information in accordance
     with the Privacy Statement that is currently in effect. If you
     have any questions about the security at our website, you can
     send an email to <a href="mailto:acquisition4@mailca.custhelp.com">acquisition4@mailca.custhelp.com</a>.</p>
