<h2><strong>Domino’s applications for smart devices</strong></h2>
<p>Domino’s offers various applications for smart devices; these applications allow you to (amongst other things) order pizzas, track your order, locate your nearest store and receive vouchers or current deal notifications.</p>
<p>You will be able to access your Domino’s Online Ordering account using these applications.</p>

<p>marketing (i.e. a nearby store sending you a special deal); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identification of your closest Domino’s store.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will have the ability to opt out of these location tracking services by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>declining this option when first prompted by the application; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>manually turning this function off within your smart device’s settings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
