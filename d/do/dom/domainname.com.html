    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p class="breadcrumb"><a href="index.php">Portal Home</a> &gt; <a href="dnc/privacy-policy.php">Privacy Policy</a></p>
<p>DomainName.com respects your  privacy. We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our  commitment to you, our customer. This privacy statement discloses the privacy  practices for the site <a href="http://www.domainname.com">www.domainname.com</a>.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li class="bulletlist"><span class="bulletlist">We do not give third parties       access to your personal information. </span></li>
  <li class="bulletlist"><span class="bulletlist">We only send e-mail or postal       mail to you if you have elected to receive it.* </span></li>
  <li class="bulletlist"><span class="bulletlist">If we determine that any       account with us is being used for the purpose of sending spam, we will       take action to shut it down as soon as possible. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Since domain name registration  information is available to the public, anyone can access it through  "whois" searches. At times our customers may have been included  within these searches. However, the spam they received does not in any way come  from DomainName.</p>
<p>We will never give any information  about you to others without your express permission. Our site uses forms in  which you give us contact information (like your name, address, and e-mail  address) so you can place orders, request information etc. We use your customer  information only when it will be important for us to contact you regarding  functionality changes to our products, our web site, new services, and special  offers we think you'll find valuable.</p>
<p>We use information gathered about  you from our site statistics (for example your IP address) to help diagnose  problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. We also gather broad  demographic information from this data to help us improve our site and make  your browsing and purchasing experience more enjoyable. This is not linked to  any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Our site uses cookies to keep track  of your session information. We also use cookies to store your username if you  request to remember your username during login. That information will be used  to pre-fill the login form at a later time. If you are referred to our website  through an ad or a partner, we will store the referral information in the  cookies.</p>
<p>Our site also contains links to  other third party Web sites. DomainName.com (<a href="http://www.domainname.com">www.domainname.com</a>) is not responsible for the privacy  practices or the content of such Web sites.</p>
<p>Our site has security measures in  place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our  control. We use 256 bit SSL security to encrypt any transmissions when you  provide credit card information, personal data, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Sending  Emails</strong><br>
  We use e-mails to communicate with  you, to confirm your placed orders, and to send information that you have  requested. You can contact us directly using the email address <a href="mailto:support@domainname.com">support@domainname.com</a> or “Submit Ticket” page. We strive  to promptly reply to your messages.<br>
  The information you send to us may  be stored and used to improve our site and our products, or it may be reviewed  and discarded. However, your information will only be shared with third parties  with your explicit permission.</p>
<p><strong>Only  If We Have To</strong><br>
  As stated previously in this policy,  we will never give out your information without your permission. The only  exceptions to this are, when we are required by law, in the good-faith belief  that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, or  we must comply with a legal process served on our web site.</p>
<p><strong>Changes  In Our Practices</strong><br>
  If we change our information  handling practices or other privacy aspects, we will post those changes on this  privacy statement, at least 7 days prior to their implementation. Please review  our privacy policies from time to time to know about the changes. We may also  try to notify you through e-mail of the privacy changes if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Credit  Card Processor</strong><br>
  We use a credit card processing  company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain,  share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary  purposes. If you would like to know more about privacy policies of our credit  card processing company, you may e-mail us at <a href="mailto:support@domainname.com">support@domainname.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Contests</strong><br>
  From time to time our site requests  information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys  or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether  or not to respond and disclose this information. Information requested may  include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic  information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to  notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for  purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>
<p><strong>Tell-A-Friend</strong><br>
  If a user elects to use our referral  service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend’s  name and e-mail address. DomainName will automatically send the friend a  one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site. DomainName does not store this  information in the database but uses it just to send the one-time e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>Personal  Information Following Termination of Account</strong><br>
  When Your DomainName account is  cancelled (either voluntarily or involuntarily) all of your personally  identifiable information is placed in "deactivated" status within our  corresponding databases. However, you should know that deactivation of your  account does not mean your personally identifiable information has been deleted  from our database entirely. We will retain and use your personally identifiable  information if necessary in order to resolve disputes or enforce our  agreements.</p>
<p><strong>Contacting  the Web Site</strong><br>
  If you have questions or concerns  regarding this statement, you can contact DomainName &nbsp;at <a href="mailto:support@domainname.com">support@domainname.com</a>. You may also contact us at:</p>
