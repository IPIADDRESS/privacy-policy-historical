<p><b>Accessing and correcting your personal information</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may request access to any personal information we hold about you by contacting us using the contact information provided below. We will not charge for simply making a request and will not charge for making any corrections to your personal information. &nbsp;However, depending on the nature and scope of the personal information you have requested, we may charge you a reasonable fee to provide access to this information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you make an access request, we will ask you to verify your identity. There may be instances where, for legal reasons, we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold. For example, we may need to refuse access if granting access would interfere with the privacy of others, or if it would result in a breach of confidentiality. If that happens, we will give you written reasons for any refusal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then you may request us to amend it. We will consider if the information requires amendment. If we do not agree that there are grounds for amendment, then we will add a note to the personal information stating that you disagree with it.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">our related bodies corporate, partnerships and joint venture entities; </span></li>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We take reasonable steps to ensure that the overseas recipients of your personal information do not breach the privacy obligations relating to your personal information.</span></p>
<p><b>GDPR</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the European General Data Protection Regulation (</span><b>GDPR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) applies in respect of any of the personal information we collect, then the following sections apply to that personal information. &nbsp;For the purposes of GDPR (as applicable), we are the ‘controller’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In respect of residents of the European Economic Area (</span><b>EEA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), references to personal information in this Privacy Policy means any information that (either in isolation or in combination with other information) enables you to be identified directly or indirectly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some instances, we may combine other information with personal information. If other information is combined with personal information or is used to build a profile of an individual (in a way which could be reasonably used to identify that individual), the combined information will be treated by us as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a resident in the EEA, you have the following rights in relation to your personal information (where applicable):</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Access</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not personal information concerning you is being processed, and, where that is the case, to request access to the personal information. This access information includes – inter alia – the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal information concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal information have been or will be disclosed. However, this is not an absolute right and the interests of other individuals may restrict your right of access. You may have the right to obtain a copy of the personal information undergoing processing free of charge. For further copies requested by you, we may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Rectification</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to have incomplete or inaccurate personal information that we process about you rectified. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Deletion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to request that we delete personal information that we process about you, except we are not obliged to do so if we need to retain such data in order to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims or if other statutory restrictions apply. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Restriction</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Depending on the circumstances and as provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to restrict our processing of your personal information where you believe such data to be inaccurate; our processing is unlawful; or that we no longer need to process such data for a particular purpose or where other legal grounds to request restriction apply unless we are not able to delete the data due to a legal or other obligation or because you do not wish for us to delete it or because other statutory restrictions apply. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Portability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Depending on the circumstances and as provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to obtain personal information we hold about you, in a structured, electronic format, and to transmit such data to you or another data controller, where this is (i) personal information which you have provided to us, and (ii) if we are processing that data on the basis of your consent or to perform a contract with you. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Objection</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under certain circumstances, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of your personal information by us and we are required to no longer process your personal information. Such right to object especially applies if we collect and process your personal information for profiling purposes in order to better understand your interests in our products and services or for certain types of direct marketing. If you have a right to object and if you exercise this right, your personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes by us. You may exercise this right by contacting the Privacy Officer. Such a right to object may, in particular, not exist if the processing of your personal information is necessary to take steps prior to entering into a contract or to perform a contract already concluded.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Withdrawing Consent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you have consented to our processing of your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, free of charge. Such a withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to your withdrawal of consent. You should note that the withdrawal of consent may not affect our right to use some or all of your personal information in circumstances where your consent was not required to use such data. &nbsp;For example, if we need your personal information to manage a contractual relationship with you or we have legitimate interest in using your data to run our website or operate our business. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can make a request to exercise any of these rights in relation to your personal information by sending the request to the Privacy Officer at the contact details provided above. </span></p>
