	<p>Safeguarding your privacy and the security of your personal information is important to us. Please take a few minutes to read the following policy so that you understand how we treat your personal information. As we continuously improve and expand our services, this policy might change, so please check it periodically. If you have questions about our privacy policy, please use the form on our <a href="https://info.dominos.com/dominos_pizza/contact.nsf/frmContact?openform">Contact Us</a> page.</p>
	
	<h2>Purpose</h2>
	<p>Domino's Pizza has adopted this Privacy Policy in order to inform you of its policies with respect to information collected from the online and mobile web site (collectively, the "Web Sites") and our tablet and smartphone applications (the "Application" or collectively the "Applications"). Your use of the Web Sites or Applications constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and your consent to the practices it describes.</p>
	
	<h2>Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
	<p>Personally Identifiable Information is any information that concerns you individually and would permit someone to contact you, for example, your name, address, telephone/fax number, email address or any information you submit to dominos.com or the Applications that identifies you individually.<br><br>The Web Sites or the Applications will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it.<br><br>Therefore, if you do not want us to obtain any personally identifiable information about you, please do not submit it to us.<br><br>You can visit and browse the Domino's Pizza Web Sites and the Applications without revealing personally identifiable information about yourself. You may also choose to disclose personally identifiable information about yourself, which may be maintained as described below. The Web Sites and the Applications may collect personally identifiable information about you by methods such as the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Registration Forms - If you are offered the opportunity to enter a promotion, to become a registered user of dominos.com, or to opt-in to receive Domino's Pizza information through another site or the Applications, you must apply by filling out the registration form on the site or the Application. This form requires certain personally identifiable information that may include, without limitation, your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, areas of interest, product usage, and/or a unique individual password.</li>
		<li>Transactions and Activity - If you become a registered user or if you conduct transactions through the Web Sites or an Application, we will collect information about the transactions you engage in while on the Web Sites or Application and your other activity on the site or Application. This information may include, without limitation, areas of the Web Sites or Application that you visit, transaction type, content that you view, download or submit, transaction amount, payment, and billing information as well as the nature, quantity and price of the goods or services you exchange and the individuals or entities with whom you communicate or transact business.</li>
		<li>Email and other voluntary communications - You may also choose to communicate with us through email, via our Web Sites, via the Applications, by telephone, in writing, or through other means. We collect the information in these communications, and such information may be personally identifiable.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
	<p>When you visit the Domino's Pizza Web Sites and Applications, like when you visit most other web sites and applications, certain anonymous information about your visit is automatically logged, which may include information about the type of browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you access the internet (such as "aol.com" or "earthlink.net"), the date and time you access the site, the pages you access while at the Domino's Pizza Web Sites, and the internet address of the web sites, if any, from which you linked directly to the Domino's Pizza site or Application. This information is not personally identifiable.</p>
	
	<h2>Information Use</h2>
	<p>Domino's Pizza may use the personally identifiable information collected through its Web Sites or Applications primarily for such purposes as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>helping to establish and verify the identity of users;</li>
		<li>opening, maintaining, administering and servicing users' accounts or memberships;</li>
		<li>processing, servicing or enforcing transactions and sending related communications;</li>
		<li>providing services and support to users;</li>
		<li>improving the Web Sites, including tailoring it to users' preferences;</li>
		<li>providing users with product or service updates, promotional notices and offers, and other information about Domino's Pizza and its affiliates;</li>
		<li>responding to your questions inquiries, comments and instructions;</li>
		<li>maintaining the security and integrity of its systems.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Domino's Pizza uses the anonymous browsing information collected automatically by its servers primarily to help it administer and improve its Web Sites and Applications. Domino's may also use aggregated anonymous information to provide information about its Web Sites and Applications to potential business partners and other unaffiliated entities. Again, this information is not personally identifiable.</p>
	
	<h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
	<p>Domino's Pizza does not provide personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties for their use in marketing directly to you. Domino's Pizza may use unaffiliated companies to help it maintain and operate its Web Sites, Applications or for other reasons related to the operation of its business, and those companies may receive your personally identifiable information for that purpose. These companies may only use such personally identifiable information for the purpose or performing those functions and may not use it for any other purpose. Domino's may also disclose personally identifiable information about you in connection with legal requirements, such as in response to an authorized subpoena, governmental request or investigation, or as otherwise permitted by law.</p>
	
	<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
	<p>The Web Sites and Applications are directed toward and designed for use by persons aged 13 or older. Domino's Pizza will not approve applications of, or establish or maintain registrations for any child whom Domino's knows to be under the age of 13. Domino's Pizza does not solicit or knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If Domino's nevertheless discovers that it has received personally identifiable information from an individual who indicates that he or she is, or whom Domino's Pizza otherwise has reason to believe is, under the age of 13, Domino's will delete such information from its systems. Additionally, a child's parent or legal guardian may request that the child's information be corrected or deleted from our files by requesting this via our <a href="https://info.dominos.com/dominos_pizza/contact.nsf/frmContact?openform">Contact Us</a> page.</p>
	
	<h2>"Cookies" and Advertisers</h2>
	<p>The Domino's Pizza Web Sites' and Applications' server, or the servers of companies that are used to operate the Web Sites and Applications, may place a "cookie" on your computer in order to allow you to use the Web Sites and Applications and to personalize your experience.

If you disable cookies, however, you may not be able to use certain personalized functions of the Web Sites.</p>
