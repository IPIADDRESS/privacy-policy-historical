<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and
the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used on this Web site.&nbsp; Please see our Terms
and Conditions of Site Use for additional information applicable to use of our Web site.</p>

<h4><b>The Information We Collect</b></h4>

<p>You do not have to give us personally identifiable information in order to visit our Web site.&nbsp; However, on the Web site, you may be able to order products, enter
contests, participate in a survey or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of
our online forums or communities.&nbsp; Personally identifiable information is generally provided and collected when you search, buy, bid, post, participate in a contest or questionnaire, or
communicate with customer service. As a result of those actions, you may supply us with such information as your name, address, phone numbers, email address,
contact preferences, credit card information, financial information and information relating to a support or service issue that may, alone or in
combination with other data, constitute personally identifiable information.&nbsp; If we collect personally identifiable information from you, you are giving us permission to use that information for
the specific purpose for which it is provided and to contact you regarding site services, improve or enhance site performance, to offer you information
regarding products and services, fulfill product orders, improve our Web site, to communicate to you about other matters that may be of interest to you and
for any other purpose described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; In connection with the foregoing, we may share your information with our affiliates.&nbsp;
Users unwilling to provide personally identifiable information online can choose to work with a sales representative or customer service representative to utilize member services or other site offerings.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We also may collect, store and use certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type
of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows '95 or Mac OS) and the domain
name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).&nbsp; In addition we aggregate data from multiple users in a manner that is not personally identifiable and use such data as we deem appropriate.</p>

<h4>How We Use the Information</h4>

<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling personally identifiable
information to unaffiliated third parties for their commercial use. We share personally identifiable customer information with unaffiliated third parties
only as described herein.</p>
<ul>
<p></p><li><b>Businesses We Do Not Control</b>:&nbsp; At times, we may provide products and services on our Web site in cooperation with an
unaffiliated third party.&nbsp; You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customer information related to those transactions with that third party. <p></p>

</li><li><b>Agents</b>:&nbsp; We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering
packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing
search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal
information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. <p></p>

<p></p></li><li><b>Promotional Offers</b>:&nbsp; Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we
do not give that business your name and address. <p></p>

<p></p></li><li><b>Business Transfers</b>:&nbsp; As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy companies, subsidiaries, or business
units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the  transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any
pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).&nbsp; Also, in the event that we are acquired or assigned, customer information will of course be one of the
transferred assets. <p></p>

<p></p></li><li><b>Protection of our Web site and Others</b>:&nbsp; We reserve the right to release account and other personal information when we believe
release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions of Site Use and other agreements, or protect the rights, property,
or safety of this company, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and
credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information
from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. <p></p>

<p></p></li><li><b>With Your Consent</b>:&nbsp; Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third
parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.<p></p>
</li></ul>

quantify user preferences, improve the design and content of our Web site, and enable us to personalize your user experience.&nbsp;
All such usage data shall be the exclusive property of this Web Site.</p>
