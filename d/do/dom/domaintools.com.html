<h2>DomainTools, LLC Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><i>Last updated April 2010</i></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="section-paragraph">
DomainTools LLC (“DomainTools”) (collectively, the “Site”) respects and protects
the privacy of the individuals that use the Site and our Services. 
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
The practices of DomainTools with respect to data collected and used in
connection with our Site and Services are governed by this online privacy policy
("Privacy Policy"). By accessing our Site and/or using any of our Services, you
agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and expressly consent to
DomainTools’ use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance
herewith. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of
the DomainTools Terms Of Service. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined
herein are defined in the Terms Of Service.
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THEN DO NOT USE OUR
SITE/SERVICES. 
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
DomainTools may change this Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole
discretion. Such changes shall be effective as noted in our Terms Of Service. 
</p>
<h3>Personal Information </h3>
<p class="section-paragraph">
Before granting you access to certain functions of our Site or Services, you may
be required to provide us with personal information such as your email address,
your name, company name, address, and credit-card billing information (the
“Registration Information” which makes you a “Registered User”) 
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
Subject to conditions, you will be able to review and change the information you
submit to us by accessing your Account and entering the new information yourself. 
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
It is your responsibility to always maintain your Registration Information
complete, accurate and up-to-date. In addition, DomainTools may require that
you confirm your Registration Information or certain parts of your Registration
Information at any time for any reason. 
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
Subject to conditions in the Terms Of Service and other restrictions, you may
deactivate or delete your Account or the information contained therein.
Deactivating or deleting your account can be completed in your Account page.
In certain circumstances we may refuse or delay deactivation or deletion.  Even
if an Account is deactivated or deleted, we will still retain all or some of
your information for internal use consistent with this Privacy Policy, or in
order to prevent fraud, collect fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot
problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms Of Service, and
comply with legal requirements. Therefore, you should not expect that your
information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your
requests.
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
Neither our Site nor our Services are designed for or directed to children under
the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, we ask that you do not submit any
personal information to us.
</p>
<h3>Our Use of Your Personal Information</h3>
<p class="section-paragraph">
We use your name and other personal information to identify you as a Registered
User in order to give you the full benefits of our Site and Services.
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
For instance, we use your email address to send registration reminders, to
notify you of Services or Site updates, and to send news and special offers.
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
We use your credit card or other billing information to obtain payment for
membership or other Services you have purchased.
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
We provide you the opportunity to opt-out of having your personally identifiable
information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information.  By way
of example only (and not limitation), if you register for an Account but do not
wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can generally
indicate your preference on the registration form. If you no longer wish to
receive news or promotional materials, you may opt-out of receiving them by
following the instructions included in each news release or communication.
</p>
<h3>Control of Your Registered User Account</h3>
<p class="section-paragraph">
Access to your Registered User Account and the Registration Information is
generally controlled by user name and password. It is your responsibility to
keep your user name and password confidential at all times and you are solely
responsible for all activity that occurs in your Account . If you become aware
of any unauthorized use of your Account or Registration Information, or any
other breach of security, you agree to notify DomainTools immediately. 
</p>
<h3>Web Visit Information</h3>
<p class="section-paragraph">
DomainTools notes and saves information such as time of day, browser type,
browser language, and IP address with each visit to our Site. That information
is used to verify our records and to provide more relevant services to Users.
For example, DomainTools may use your IP address or browser language to
determine which language to use when showing search results or advertisements.
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
</p><h3>Cookies</h3>
<p class="section-paragraph">
Upon your first visit to the Site, DomainTools sends a "cookie" to your
computer. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique User.
DomainTools uses cookies to improve the quality of our service and to better
understand our User base. DomainTools does this by storing User preferences in
cookies and by tracking User trends and patterns of how people search on our
Site. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your
browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Be
aware, however, that some parts of the Services may not function properly if
you refuse cookies.
</p>
<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
<p class="section-paragraph">
The Site may contain advertising and other links to third party websites at
which personal information may be collected. You understand that, in such
instances, DomainTools has no control over the information you provide and the
collection and use of your personal information will be governed by the privacy
policy applicable to that site. 
</p>
<h3>Sharing of Information with Third Parties</h3>
<p class="section-paragraph">
DomainTools does not (and will not) sell or rent any of your personal
information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your
explicit consent. However, the following describes some of the ways that your
personal information may be disclosed in the normal course of business as part
of Services provided through our Site.
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
<i>Advertisers.</i> We gather up data across numerous Registered User accounts and
disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers
and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. For such
purposes, we do not disclose any information that we believe could be used to
identify Users personally.  DomainTools may receive a fee or other benefits for
providing such information.
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
<i>Affiliates for Our Operations.</i> We may use third parties ("affiliates") to
facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the Services that we provide to
you (e.g., Transfer services related to payments,  search technology,
advertising provisions, and other services) and therefore we may provide some of
your information directly to these affiliates.  We may or may not hold an
ownership interest in these affiliates.  Affiliates are subject to
confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that restrict or
prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose
except to facilitate the specific outsourced service, unless you have
explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. In
some instances, the affiliate may collect information directly from you. In
these cases, we will strive to tell you of the involvement of the affiliate, but
what information you provide them will be up to you.
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
<i>Agents and Business Entities.</i> We share some of our data, including
personal information about you, with our affiliates, subsidiaries, and joint
venturers that are committed to serving your online needs and providing related
services throughout the world.  For example, we use banking institutions to
process all funds transfers related to our Services. These companies do not
retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for purposes
other than as related to their service or as otherwise required by law. To the
extent that these entities have access to your information, they have assured us
that they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they
obtain from their other users. 
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
Our affiliates, subsidiaries, and joint venturers follow their own privacy
practices that may be more or less protective of their users than DomainTools’s
practices described in this document. DomainTools, its affiliates, subsidiaries,
joint venturers, or any combination of such, will share some or all of your
information with another business entity should we plan to merge with, or be
acquired by, or obtain investment funds from that person or entity. 
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
<i>Legal Requests.</i> DomainTools cooperates with law enforcement authorities,
as well as with other third parties, to enforce laws, intellectual property
rights, and to prevent fraud.  Although as noted below, we typically require a
subpoena or similar legal document prior to doing so, we do reserve the right,
in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government
officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we
can, and you authorize us to, disclose your name, city, state, telephone number,
email address, login name, access history, IP address, fraud complaints, and
site use history, with or without a subpoena. 
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
Without restricting our rights to do so as noted above, as a general policy we
will not disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other
government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar
legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of
information is necessary to protect our rights or to prevent imminent physical
harm, financial loss or to report suspected past, present, or future illegal
activity. Further, we can, and you authorize us to, disclose to a third party
your information, including your name, street address, city, state, zip code,
country, phone number, email, and company name, as we in our sole discretion
believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud,
intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity.
</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p class="section-paragraph">
DomainTools follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the
personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we
receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially
acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its
absolute security.
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
Your information is stored on DomainTools' servers located in the United States
and in European Union countries. When you enter sensitive information
(such as credit card or bank information) on our registration or order forms,
we undertake to encrypt that information using secure socket layer or other
similar technology (SSL). We treat data as an asset and strive to protect it
from loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques
to protect data from unauthorized access by users whether they are “inside” or
“outside” DomainTools.  You understand and agree that "perfect security "does
not exist on the Internet or with any digital or physical data collection and
retention systems.
</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">
DomainTools personnel are trained appropriately regarding the application of
privacy practices and the importance of protecting your information.
