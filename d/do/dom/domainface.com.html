<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p id="lead-in">Read below for specifics, but basically what we're trying to convey here is that we're not going to sell your data to other people or use it for nefarious purposes.
	About the worst we might do is email you occasionally to tell you about something we feel you might find useful, or to let you know about a promotion we have on. We're not
	interested in giving others access to private stuff you put into Domainface. Make sure you're using virus checkers and stuff though- it's not our fault if someone steals your password.</p>
<hr>
<p>We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, and information volunteered by the consumer (such as survey information and/or site registrations). The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
<li>We transfer information about you if Face Software Ltd or Domainface is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Face Software Ltd will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>INFORMATION GATHERING AND USAGE</h3>

<li>Face Software Ltd uses collected information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, and research.</li>
</ul>

<h3>COOKIES</h3>
<ul>
<li>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.</li>
<li>Cookies are required to use the Domainface service.</li>
<li>We use cookies to record current session information, but do not use permanent cookies. You are required to log-in to your Domainface account after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents.</li>
</ul>

<p>Face Software Ltd uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run Domainface. Although Face Software Ltd owns the code, databases, and all rights to the Domainface application, you retain all rights to your data.</p>

<h3>DISCLOSURE</h3>
<p>Face Software Ltd may disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the Terms of Service.</p>

<h3>CHANGES</h3>
