<h3>our commitment to privacy</h3>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online
information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make
this notice easy to find, we make it available from our footer navigation that is found on every page of our
website. When you register at Doba, we ask you for personal information. We use this information to
process your orders and to communicate with you about the status of your orders. We also use your email address to
send you newsletters you are subscribed to during registration, as well as messages about Doba special
offers, promotional announcements and consumer surveys. Occasionally, we send our customers special offers and
promotional information via postal mail, using the shipping address provided. If you no longer want to receive the
newsletters or other announcements simply unsubscribe by checking the unsubscribe links.</p>

<a name="p2"></a>
<h3>the information we collect</h3>
<p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Doba website. On some pages,
you can order memberships, order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal
information collected at these pages are:
</p><table class="col2">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td>
			<ul>
				<li>name</li>
				<li>billing address</li>
				<li>email address</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
		<td>
			<ul>
				<li>phone number</li>
				<li>credit/debit card information</li>
				<li>unique identifiers (such as username and password)</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p></p>

drop shipped directly to your customer, you will need to submit their address. In this circumstance, the types of
personal information collected are:
</p><table class="col2">
	<tbody><tr>

<h3>how we use information</h3>
<ul>
	<li class="li_multi_p">
		<p>Cookies</p>
		<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about
		the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We
		use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the
		cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended
		period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Log files</p>
		<p>Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes Internet protocol
		(IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp,
		and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad
		demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<a name="p8"></a>
<h3>communications from the site</h3>
<ul>
	<li class="li_multi_p">
		<p>Special offers and updates</p>
		<p>We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username.
		Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter.
		Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.
		Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.  We also send all registrants special offers and updates regarding
		our services.  If you are a former customer, you will continue to receive special offers and updates regarding
		our services unless you choose to unsubscribe from such communications.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="li_multi_p">
		<p>Newsletter</p>
		<p>If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and
		email address. Out of respect for our users privacy, we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please
		see the Choice and Opt-out sections.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="li_multi_p">
		<p>Service announcements</p>
		<p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service-related announcement.
		For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally,
		users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these
		communications are not promotional in nature.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Customer service</p>
		<p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regard
		to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the user's wishes.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<a name="p9"></a>
<h3>communications from the company</h3>
<p>During the registration process, we collect phone information so that we may call you for the purpose of preventing
fraud during the ordering process of Doba products.  We also will call you during the first several
weeks of your trial or service to provide answers to any questions as well as to offer additional promotions only
available via phone.  After the first several weeks of your trial or service, we may periodically contact you
including to call for the purposes of improving our services via surveys as well as to offer additional
promotions.</p>

<h3>sharing — third parties</h3>
<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to
disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary
to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website. We use the
information you provide about your customers when placing a drop shipment order only to complete that order. We do
not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. At times, we
do release information about our customers to third party partners for marketing of offers we feel will benefit our
members. This information includes customer name, phone number and e-mail address. We never release credit card
information or information about purchases and buying habits. Finally, we never use or share the personally
identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing
you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>

<a name="p4"></a>
<h3>our commitment to data security</h3>
<p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information
via the website, their information is protected both online and off-line.</p>
<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that
information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure
page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft
Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just “surfing.”</p>
<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect
user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is
restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our
billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as
any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy,
and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected.  Finally, the servers that store personally
identifiable information are in a secure environment, behind a locked cage in a locked facility.</p>
<p>If users have any questions about the security at our website, users can send an email to <a href="mailto:support@doba.com">support@doba.com</a>.</p>

<a name="p5"></a>
<h3>our commitment to children’s privacy</h3>
<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain
information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to
attract anyone under 13.</p>

<a name="p6"></a>
<h3>how you can access or correct your information</h3>
<p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging into
your account and visiting the Account Info section of your Member's Only Area. We use this procedure to better
safeguard your information.</p>
<p>You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly
shows error.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting
access or making corrections.</p>

<a name="p7"></a>
<h3>how to contact us</h3>
<p>Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please call us at 800-383-6695 or send
us an email at <a href="mailto:support@doba.com">support@doba.com</a>.</p>
