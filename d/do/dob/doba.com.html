	<a name="1"></a><strong>Our Commitment To Privacy</strong>
	<p>Your privacy is important to us.  To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available from our footer navigation that is found on every page of our website.

	</p><p><a name="2"></a><strong>The Information We Collect:</strong>
	</p><p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Wholesale Marketer website. On some pages, you can order memberships, order products, make requests, and register to receive materials.  The types of personal information collected at these pages are:
		</p><ul>
		Name
		<br>Billing Address
		<br>Email address
		<br>Phone number
		<br>Credit/Debit Card Information
		<br>Unique Identifiers (such as username and password)
		<br>(etc.)
		</ul>

	<p>On some pages, you can submit information about other people.  For example, if you order a product and want it drop shipped directly to your customer, you will need to submit their address.  In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are:

		</p><ul>
		Name
		<br>Shipping Address
		<br>(etc.)
		</ul>

	<p><a name="3"></a><strong>The Way We Use Information:</strong>
	
	</p><p><strong>Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.  We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.  A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. 

	</p><p><strong>Log Files.</strong>  Like most standard Web site servers we use log files.  This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.  

	</p><p><strong>Communications from the Site.</strong>
<br>
- Special Offers and Updates: We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.
<br>
 

- Newsletter: If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.  Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications.  Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

 <br>

- Service Announcements: On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.  Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account.  However, these communications are not promotional in nature.  
<br>

- Customer Service: We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.

</p><p><strong>Sharing - 3rd Parties.</strong>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. We use the information you provide about your customers when placing an drop shipment order only to complete that order.  We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.  At times, we do release information about our customers to third party partners for marketing of offers we feel will benefit our members. This information includes customer name, phone number and e-mail address. We never release credit card information or information about purchases and buying habits. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
<br><br>
We have contracted with Overture services, Inc. (“Overture”) to monitor certain pages of our Web site for the purpose of reporting web traffic, statistics, advertisement ‘click-throughs’, and/or other activities on our site.  Where authorized by us, Overture may use cookies, Web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics on our Web site visitors. No personally identifiable data is collected by or transferred to Overture. For more information about how the information collected by Overture is used, Please see Overture’s privacy policy at http://www.overture.com/d/USm/about/company/ccprivacypolicy.jhtml



</p><p><a name="4"></a><strong>Our Commitment To Data Security</strong>

</p><p>This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.  When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

</p><p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.     

</p><p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users’ information is protected.  Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, behind a locked cage in a locked facility. 

</p><p>If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to <a href="mailto:support@wholesalemarketer.com">support@wholesalemarketer.com</a>


	</p><p><a name="5"></a><strong>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</strong>
	</p><p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.  For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

	</p><p><a name="6"></a><strong>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</strong>
	</p><p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging into your account and visiting the Account Info section of your Member's Only Area. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.
	</p><p>You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.
	</p><p>To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

	</p><p><a name="7"></a><strong>How To Contact Us</strong>
	</p><p>Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please call us at 888-832-4969 or send us an email at <a href="mailto:support@wholesalemarketer.com">support@wholesalemarketer.com</a>.
