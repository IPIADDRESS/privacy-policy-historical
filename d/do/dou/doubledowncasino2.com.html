     <h3>IMPORTANT NOTICE: This Privacy Policy has been updated as of June 2019.</h3>

<p>NOTE: THIS WEBSITE AND THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREIN DO NOT OFFER "REAL MONEY GAMBLING" OR AN OPPORTUNITY TO WIN REAL MONEY OR PRIZES BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF PLAY.</p>

<p>The games and other activities offered on the Website and Apps are referred to in this Privacy Policy as the "Services".</p>

<p>Please read this Policy carefully before accessing the Website, the Apps or using our Services as it provides important information about how we collect, store, use and disclose your personal and other information when providing our Services to you or when you access the Website or Apps. You should also review the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.doubledowninteractive.com/terms/index.html">TERMS OF USE</a>&nbsp;for important information about your use of the Website or Apps and our Services.
  DoubleDown Website and Apps are managed and operated by DoubleDown Interactive, LLC ("DoubleDown" or "our" or "we" or "us"). Visitors to the DoubleDown Website or Apps and users of the Services are referred to as "you."
  </p>

<h3>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
<p><strong>Passive Information</strong><br>
  Passive information refers to information that is automatically collected from your device(s) when you access the Website or Apps and use the Services. DoubleDown may collect passive information such as your IP address, referral data, browser type, browser language, platform type, type of mobile or other computing device, and geographical data, such as zip code and geographic location. Your browser or device typically sends passive information to our servers without your intervention whenever you visit our Website or Apps and use the Services. For example, your browser or device may tell us your IP address (which may tell us generally where you are located) and the type of browser and device you are using. When you visit our Website or Apps, your browser may also tell us information such as the page or link that led you to our Website or Apps and, if applicable, the search terms you typed into a search engine that led you to our Website or Apps.
</p>
		
<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
  While you are using the Services, we may seek to place a "cookie" (a small data file) or other tracking technology on your mobile device, computer or other participating device. If you access our Website, Apps or Services via a Partner Site, the Partner Site may also place cookies on your device as permitted by the terms of the agreement and your privacy settings with the Partner Site. Cookies placed by us are not used to obtain any personal data, and the information that is tracked is used only for internal purposes, such as to improve the Services. If you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your web browser on your computer or device to reject them or to alert you before one is placed. Be advised, however, that some of our features and services may not function properly if you disable cookies.
</p>

<p><strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
  Personal information, which is sometimes referred to as personally identifiable information, means information that is specific to you and can be used to contact or identify you. Unless you are using the Services on a guest basis, you must have a valid, active Facebook account to use and access the Services. Accordingly, we receive from Facebook certain personal data about you that you authorize Facebook to disclose, such as your user name, date of birth, friend list, email address and profile picture, or you may voluntarily disclose information such as your gender or your play preferences to us through your use of the Services. Any information directly collected through your Facebook account and shared with us will be imported, used and stored in a manner consistent with the Facebook Platform Policy applicable to developers in effect at the time of collection (see <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/policy/" target="_blank&quot;_blank&quot;">https://developers.facebook.com/policy/</a>) and in compliance with any specific privacy settings set by you of which we are aware.
  We may also collect personal information from vendors that help us to operate the Website and Apps and provide services such as processing credit card payments and sending emails on our behalf. For example, we may receive confirmation that you have made a payment by credit card and other information related to any of your gaming transactions associated with your use of the Services. To help keep our databases current and to provide you the most relevant content and experiences, we may combine personal information from you with information from public sources and our trusted partners, in accordance with applicable law and this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
		
<p>Please note that because a third party vendor manages your purchases of virtual currency for use the Services, we do not have access to your credit card or billing information. Be advised that this Privacy Policy does not apply to this and other third-party vendors.
</p>

<h3>ONLINE ADVERTISING</h3>
<p><strong>DoubleDown Online Advertising</strong><br> 
  DoubleDown utilizes online advertising, including displaying DoubleDown advertisements to you across the Internet on websites and in applications. We collect information about which of our advertisements are displayed, which advertisements are clicked on, and on which web page the advertisement was displayed.
</p>

<p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong><br> 
DoubleDown permits third parties to place advertisements on our properties, including our Website, Apps and the Services. When advertisers or advertising networks place advertisements on DoubleDown properties, they may collect or we may share the following types of information from within our properties:</p>

<p>
• performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);<br>

• aggregated and/or de-identified information about you and other players collectively that is not intended to specifically identify you (like players between the ages of 30 and 40 who also own a Lamborghini);<br>

• certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-permanent and anonymous device identifiers such as Apple Identifier For Advertisers (IDFAs), and Google Advertising ID);<br>

• your social network ID;<br>

• other contextual data about your game play (for example, games played and session length).
<br>

After clicking on a third-party advertisement, you may no longer be on a website or other property hosted by DoubleDown or the social network through which you are playing our games. Be advised that any personal information that you disclose in connection with a third-party online advertisement is not governed by this Privacy Policy. See below for information on how to opt-out of being served online advertising by third parties. <br></p>
	
<p><strong>Offer Walls</strong><br> 
DoubleDown games or their purchase pages may display an "Offer Wall" that is hosted by a third-party provider. The offer wall allows third party advertisers to provide virtual currency or other rewards to players in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those advertisers. These offers are not made by DoubleDown. These offers may be shown to you based on certain technical information, like your geographic area or de-identified demographic information. After clicking on one of these offers, you will no longer be on a site hosted by DoubleDown or the social network through which you are playing DoubleDown's games. To properly credit player accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier, in some cases your social network ID or DoubleDown player ID, will be shared with the Offer Wall provider.</p>

For residents of the European Economic Area (EEA), we advise that your personal information will be transferred to and processed in the United States, which has data protection laws that are different than those in your country and may not be as protective.  The United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR.  Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information or information is to do so with your consent; where we need the personal information for performance of a contract, or where the collection and use is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

•	Complain to your local data protection authority at any time;<br>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS</h3>		

<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
We will only collect and use personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes.  We will maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security safeguards to ensure the security, integrity, accuracy and privacy of the information you have provided. Please be aware, however, that no information system is totally secure, and therefore we cannot guarantee against all potential security breaches.

You are advised to examine the privacy policies of these third- party sites before providing any personal information.</p>

<p><strong>California Do Not Track Disclosures</strong><br>
The California Online Privacy Protection Act (“CalOPPA”) requires that online privacy notices disclose how a site responds to "Do Not Track" signals ("DNT").  We currently do not honor DNT signals.</p>
		
<p><strong>California “Shine The Light”</strong><br>
If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (“Shine-The-Light” law) permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by us, or our subsidiaries or affiliates, to a third party for the third party’s direct marketing purposes.
