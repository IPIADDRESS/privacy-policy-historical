    <td><h2> PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
      <p>Welcome to douho.com (the "Site").<br> <br>We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, especially when conducting business. <br> This statement governs our privacy policies with respect to those users of the Site ("Visitors") who visit without <br>transacting business and Visitors who register to transact business on the Site and make use of the various services offered by douho.com (collectively, "Services") ("Authorized Customers").<br>

<br><b>"Personally Identifiable Information"</b> <br> refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, financial profiles, social security number, and credit card information.

<b>What Personally Identifiable Information is collected? </b><br>We may collect basic user profile information from all of our Visitors. We collect the following additional information from our Authorized Customers: the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of Authorized Customers, the nature and size of the business, and the nature and size of the advertising inventory that the Authorized Customer intends to purchase or sell.<br>
<br>
<b>What organizations are collecting the information? </b><br>In addition to our direct collection of information, our third party service vendors (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses and banks) who may provide such services as credit, insurance, and escrow services may collect this information from our Visitors and Authorized Customers. We do not control how these third parties use such information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal information provided to them from Visitors and Authorized Customers. Some of these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as links in the distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or use the information given to them.<br>
<br>
<b>How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?</b><br> We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling requests on the Site. We may email Visitors and Authorized Customers about research or purchase and selling opportunities on the Site or information related to the subject matter of the Site. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and Authorized Customers in response to specific inquiries, or to provide requested information.

Sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers, is protected by encryption protocols, in place to protect information sent over the Internet.

However, because of backups and records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor's entry without retaining some residual information.

<br>
<br><b>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?</b><br> We will let our Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes to our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site. However, if we are changing our privacy policy in a manner that might cause disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that a Visitor or Authorized Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we will contact such Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or Authorized Customer to prevent such disclosure.
