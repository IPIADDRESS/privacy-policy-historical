<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>  Do You Know Inc.  (<strong>“DYK”</strong>,<strong> “we”</strong> or <strong>“us”</strong>)  operates a social networking service by the name of <em>DoUKnow?</em><strong> </strong>( <strong>“<em>DoUKnow?”</em> </strong>or the <strong>“Service”</strong>), that allows members  to communicate with one another through the sharing of member-generated content  and member-supplied information.&nbsp; We have created this Privacy Policy  to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and  disclosure of personal information.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  This Privacy  Policy applies only to the information that you provide to us.&nbsp; It explains what data we collect from you and  how we use it, share it, and safeguard it.&nbsp;  By using our Service, you are accepting and agreeing to the policies and  practices set forth in this Privacy Policy and in our <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79&amp;catid=78&amp;Itemid=563">Terms and Conditions</a>.&nbsp; Any privacy-related dispute will be governed  by this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.<br>
  For the  purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>“personal  information”</strong> means information that can identify an individual directly or  through other reasonably available means.&nbsp;  The meaning of “personal information” shall be interpreted in a manner  that conforms with the minimum requirements of applicable provincial and  federal privacy legislation.<br>
  The Service  is not available to individuals who are younger than 13 years old.&nbsp; If you are younger than 13 years old, please  do not provide us with any of your information.&nbsp; <br>
  What Personal Information is Collected?<br>
  The choice to provide us with your personal information is  always yours.&nbsp; However, your decision to  withhold particular information may limit our ability to provide you with some  of our services.<br>
  DYK receives and stores various types of information about  you, as follows:<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Registration  information</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>DoUKnow?</em> is a social networking tool  that operates through the mutual sharing of information.&nbsp; The Service operates on the assumption that  users want to provide and share certain personal information with one  another.&nbsp; We therefore collect some  personal information about you when you register with us, namely username and  password information, your name, email address, gender, city, province, and  country. &nbsp;We also ask that you complete  an “About Me” section, which will appear on your member profile.&nbsp; All of this information constitutes  registration information.&nbsp; Registration  information is used to allow you to set up a member account and profile that  can be used to interact with others through the Service. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Information  You Choose to Share</strong><br>
  We receive and store any  information you enter on our Service or provide to us in any other way.&nbsp; In addition to registration information, you  have the option of providing DYK and its members with additional information,  including but not limited to your date of birth, mobile phone number, address,  website, and education information.&nbsp; You  may also choose to upload to our website an avatar, or photographs or videos of  yourself.&nbsp; And you may choose to create  Super DoUKnow lists, events, and groups, and broadcast status updates. &nbsp;This information is provided on a voluntary  basis and allows you to better interact with other members through the  Service.&nbsp; <br>
  We may use your personal information in order to adapt our  Service to better serve you and our community.&nbsp;  We may also use your personal information to communicate with you about  your use of the Service, as well as to inform you about specials and new  features. </p>
<p>  How is Your Personal Information Shared?<br>
  </p>
<p>Personal information about our members is an integral part of  our business.&nbsp; <em>DoUKnow?</em> is a social networking tool that facilities the sharing of  personal information.&nbsp; Members  voluntarily join the Service to presumably network with others through the  sharing of personal information.&nbsp; Given  that the nature of our Service is based on the sharing of information, your username,  avatar, gender, date of birth, “About Me” information, mobile phone, address,  city, province, country, website, and education information are visible to the  public by default.&nbsp; Note that only your  username, gender, city, province, country, and “About Me” information is mandatory  in order to use the Service, and that your username must always be public  information.</p>
<p>  Notwithstanding this default, you have control over the  sharing of all of your other information.&nbsp;  The option is yours as to what content and what information you wish to  be public, visible only to <em>DoUKnow?</em> Members,  visible only to your <em>DoUKnow?</em> Friends,  or visible only to you.&nbsp; Each of these  options is explained below.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Visible to the Public:</strong> By selecting this option, you acknowledge  that your content becomes publicly available information.&nbsp; This means that anyone, including people who  are not registered with DYK, will be able to see it.<strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Visible to <em>DoUKnow?</em> Members:</strong> By selecting this option, you acknowledge that your content is visible to all  members of the Service, regardless of whether you know them.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Visible to <em>DoUKnow?</em></strong> <strong>Friends:</strong> By selecting this option, you  acknowledge that your content is visible only to those individuals who you have  chosen to approve as “friends” on the Service.&nbsp;  The content is otherwise not visible to other members of the Service or  to the general public.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Visible Only to Me:</strong> By selecting this option, you acknowledge that  you are providing DYK with content that is personal to you, and you elect to  not have such content shared with others.<br>
  </p>
<p>If you are uncomfortable with the sharing of your information,  please ensure your privacy settings are set for the most privacy protective (so  that only your username and avatar, if applicable, are disclosed  publicly).&nbsp; If you are not comfortable  with even your username and avatar being public, <em>DoUKnow?</em>, given its design and purpose, may not be appropriate for  you.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
<p>Note that, depending on your privacy settings, you may be  searchable on the Service by the information you provide.&nbsp; For example, if you choose to have your email  address visible to <em>DoUKnow? </em>members,  a member may search you by your email address and request to connect as  “friends”.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
<p>You should be aware that persons having access to your  content through our Service may use it or disclose it to other individuals or  entities without our control and without your knowledge.&nbsp; <strong>We  therefore urge you to think carefully before you upload any content, or supply  any information, that you may deem private.</strong><br>
  </p>
<p>We neither rent nor sell your personal information to  anyone.&nbsp; We only share your personal  information with others in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy, or as  otherwise notified to you.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
<p>By uploading content to <em>DoUKnow? </em>(e.g. photos, videos), you grant DYK a worldwide, non-exclusive,  royalty-free licence to use, copy, distribute, process, adapt, modify, publish,  and transmit such uploaded content in any and all media or distribution  methods, even where it contains, consists of, or includes content covered by  intellectual property rights.&nbsp; By  providing DYK with uploaded content, you grant DYK a right to sublicense and  allow DYK to distribute such uploaded content to other companies, organizations  or persons who partner with DYK for the syndication, consolidation, broadcast,  distribution or publication of such uploaded content.<br>
  </p>
<p>Using <em>DoUKnow?</em> Features<br>
  </p>
<p>The Service has the following features that may allow you to  share your information with others.&nbsp;  Please remember that if you choose to provide personal information using  certain features of the Service, that information may be available to the  entire <em>DoUKnow?</em> community, or may be  published on the <em>DoUKnow?</em> website.<br>
  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a profile</li>
  <li> Upload a photo (avatar or other)</li>
  <li>    Upload a video</li>
  <li>    “Friend” or “unfriend” other members</li>
  <li>    Be followed by other members</li>
  <li>    Create a Super DoUKnow list</li>
  <li>    Chat with other members and/or connect to  Facebook/Gtalk chat programs*</li>
  <li>Post questions,  view and offers replies and opinions in the “Ask” feature<br>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>* Note that any information shared to Facebook and/or Gtalk  users, or shared through Facebook and/or Gtalk accounts, is subject to the  terms of use and privacy policies of such services, as applicable.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Disclosure to Third Parties<br>
  </strong></p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties in accordance  with this Privacy Policy where you have so consented or in those limited  circumstances set out below. <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Where  required or permitted by law</strong><br>
  </p>
<p>The type of information we are  legally required to disclose may relate to criminal investigations.&nbsp; In some instances, such as a legal proceeding  or court order, we may also be required to disclose your personal information  to authorities.&nbsp; Only the information  specifically requested is disclosed and we take precautions to satisfy  ourselves that the authorities that are making the disclosure request have  legitimate grounds to do so.&nbsp; <br>
  Your personal information may also  be disclosed in situations where we are legally permitted to do so, such as in  the course of employing reasonable and legal methods to enforce your rights or  to investigate suspicion of unlawful activities.&nbsp; We may release certain personal information  when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to protect the  rights, property and safety of ourselves and others.&nbsp; <br>
  <strong>In the  context of a business transfer, bankruptcy or transaction</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We  may use your personal information and disclose your personal information to  third parties in connection with the proposed or actual financing, insuring,  sale, securitization, assignment or other disposal of all or part of our  business or assets (including accounts) for the purposes of evaluating and/or  performing the proposed transaction.&nbsp;  These purposes may include, as examples, permitting such parties to  determine whether to proceed or continue with the transaction, fulfilling any  reporting or audit requirements to such parties, and/or disclosing personal information  as part of concluding a sale or transfer of assets.&nbsp; Our successors and assigns may collect, use  and disclose your personal information for substantially the same purposes as  those set out in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where we  employ a third party service provider</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We  may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to  provide the Service on our behalf, to perform website-related services, such as  maintenance services, database management, and web analytics, or to assist us  in analyzing how our Service is used.&nbsp;  These third parties may have access to your personal information only to  perform these tasks on our behalf.&nbsp; In  such instances, we will use contractual or other means to ensure such third  parties provide a comparable level of protection over your personal information  while it is in their control.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Except as specifically provided for in this Privacy Policy,  we do not disclose any personal information to third parties.<br>
  </p>
<p>Email Communications<br>
  </p>
<p>We email you with information that we think you will find  useful.&nbsp; Our emails may contain news,  products, offers, surveys or promotions related to our Service.&nbsp; We may email you to inform you of group  invitations, friendship requests, and account details.&nbsp; We also email you notice of changes to our Terms  of Use and Privacy Policy.&nbsp; If you do not  want to receive commercial email or other mail from us, you can choose the  unsubscribe option in the emails we send to you or you can change your account  settings.&nbsp; Please note that, in all  cases, you will continue to receive system updates (such as forgotten usernames  and passwords) and legal notices from us, such as notices regarding this Privacy  Policy and our Terms of Use.&nbsp; Those legal  notices govern your use of the Service and you are responsible for reviewing  them for changes.&nbsp; Notices will also be  posted on our website, and will govern use of the website.<br>
  </p>
<p>Security<br>
  </p>
<p><em>DoUKnow?</em> accounts  are password-protected for your privacy and security.&nbsp; We recommend that you select your password  carefully and limit access to your computer and browser (e.g. sign off after  each use) to prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information.<br>
  </p>
<p>We endeavour to safeguard member information through the  employment of reasonable physical, technological, and administrative security  measures.&nbsp; However, no method of  transmission of information over the Internet, or method of electronic storage,  is 100% secure.&nbsp; We cannot guarantee the  security of member information. <br>
  The Service may contain links to other sites. &nbsp;DYK is not responsible for the privacy  policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site, you  should read the privacy policy stated on that site. This Privacy Policy only  governs information collected on the Service.<br>
  </p>
<p>Changing or Deleting Your Personal Information<br>
  </p>
<p>We make every reasonable effort to keep your personal  information as accurate, complete and up-to-date as necessary for the purposes  for which it was collected.&nbsp; You may  update certain personal information by visiting the Profile tab on the top of  the <em>DoUKnow? </em>website, and by  selecting “Edit Profile”.&nbsp; Personal  information is retained only for so long as is reasonably necessary to fulfil  the purposes for which it was collected.<br>
  Upon request, you can also access our records of your  personal information and challenge the accuracy and completeness of the  information and have it amended as appropriate.&nbsp;  Should you identify any incorrect or out-of-date information, DYK will remedy  any errors on a reasonable and timely basis.<br>
  </p>
<p>Deleting your account permanently removes your account  information from <em>DoUKnow?</em>.&nbsp; Should you wish to permanently delete your  account, please log in to your account and click on the appropriate link on the  “Edit Profile” page.&nbsp; If you terminate  your account, your profile and personal information will be removed from the <em>DoUKnow? </em>site and deleted from our  servers.&nbsp; Note that some of the content  that you uploaded (e.g. photos, videos, status updates) may not be deleted upon  account deletion.&nbsp; DYK has no control  over content indexed on other websites or search engines, or content that has  been shared by you and copied, distributed, re-posted, published or otherwise  transmitted by other members.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
<p>Changes to this Privacy Policy<br>
  </p>
<p>DYK may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time.&nbsp; Use of information we collect now is subject  to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.&nbsp; If we make material changes to this Privacy  Policy, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you by posting an  announcement on our Service and/or by sending you an email.&nbsp; Material changes to the Privacy Policy will  be binding thirty (30) days after such changes have been introduced and for  which notification of such material changes has been made.&nbsp; The date when this Privacy Policy was most  recently amended is noted at the bottom of the Privacy Policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
<p>Our Policy Toward Children<br>
  </p>
<p>The Service is not available to individuals who are younger  than 13 years old, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from  children under the age of 13.&nbsp; If we  become aware that a child under the age of 13 has registered with our Service  or provided us with personal information, we will delete such child’s account  and information.<br>
  </p>
<p>Children between the ages of 13 and 16 require parental  consent to use the Service.&nbsp; If we become  aware that a child between the ages of 13 and 16 has registered with our  Service or provided us with personal information absent parental consent, we  will delete such child’s account and information.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has  provided us with personal information contrary to the terms of this Privacy  Policy, he or she should contact us at info@douknow.com <br>
  </p>
<p>Website Governed by this Privacy Policy<br>
  </p>
<p>Our website (http://www.douknow.com/) is governed by the  provisions and practices stated in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Our website may contain links to third party  sites that are not governed by this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;Although we endeavour to only link to sites that  share our commitment to your privacy, please be aware that this Privacy Policy  will no longer apply once you leave our website. &nbsp;We are not responsible for the privacy  practices of third party sites. &nbsp;We therefore  suggest that you closely examine the respective privacy policies of third party  websites to learn how they collect, use and disclose your personal information.<br>
  </p>
<p>Governing Law<br>
  </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy, and the handling of personal  information, is governed solely by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the  federal laws of Canada applicable therein, to the exclusion of any rules of  private international law or conflict of laws which would lead to the  application of any other laws.<br>
  </p>
<p>Members may reside outside of Canada and DYK may perform  activities outside of Canada through third parties.&nbsp; In particular, DYK uses the services of GoDaddy.com,  LLC to manage its servers.&nbsp; As a result,  personal information may be stored, processed, or accessed in other countries  and may be subject to the laws of those countries.&nbsp; Information may be disclosed in response to  valid demands or requests from government authorities, courts, or law  enforcement in those countries.&nbsp; For  example, information that is processed, used, stored or accessed in the United  States may be subject to the Patriot Act and applicable anti-terrorism  legislation, together with other legislation applicable within the United  States.<br>
  </p>
<p>Addressing Your Inquiries and Concerns<br>
  We are happy to discuss the content of this Privacy Policy  with you and to answer any questions that you may have.&nbsp; Please direct all questions or enquiries  about this Privacy Policy to <strong>info@douknow.com</strong></p>
