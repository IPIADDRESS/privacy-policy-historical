				<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

				<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Double Robotics, Inc., we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
					<li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
					<li>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our <a href="http://support.doublerobotics.com">support team</a>.</p>
				<p>Double Robotics, Inc. (“Double Robotics, Inc.”) operates www.doublerobotics.com. It is Double Robotics, Inc.’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.</p>
				<h4>Website Visitors</h4>
				<p>Like most website operators, Double Robotics, Inc. collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Double Robotics, Inc.'s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Double Robotics, Inc.'s visitors use its website. From time to time, Double Robotics, Inc. may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
				<p>Double Robotics, Inc. also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Double Robotics, Inc. only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
				<h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
				<p>Certain visitors to Double Robotics, Inc.’s website choose to interact with Double Robotics, Inc. in ways that require Double Robotics, Inc. to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Double Robotics, Inc. gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at doublerobotics.com to provide a username and email address. Double Robotics, Inc. collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Double Robotics, Inc.. Double Robotics, Inc. does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
				<h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4>
				<p>Double Robotics, Inc. may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. However, Double Robotics, Inc. does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
				<h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
				<p>Double Robotics, Inc. discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Double Robotics, Inc.’s behalf or to provide services available at Double Robotics, Inc.’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Double Robotics, Inc.’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Double Robotics, Inc. will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Double Robotics, Inc. discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Double Robotics, Inc. believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Double Robotics, Inc., third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Double Robotics, Inc. website and have supplied your email address, Double Robotics, Inc. may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Double Robotics, Inc. and our products.
