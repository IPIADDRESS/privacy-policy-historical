<div class="legal-head">DOUBLEAGENT.COM PRIVACY POLICY</div>
Last Updated: January 10, 2007

<br>
<br>

<p class="legal-text">This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") covers our treatment of
personally identifiable information we collect online when you access the Double
Agent ("we," "us," or "our") web site located at
doubleagent.com (the "Web Site"). This Privacy Policy applies and is
limited to the treatment of information that is collected via the Web Site. We
understand and respect your desire for privacy and will make reasonable efforts
to use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please
review this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing and using the Web Site, you
indicate your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.</p>


<div class="legal-group">INFORMATION COLLECTION</div>
<p class="legal-text">Double Agent and/or its affiliates are the sole owner(s) of the information
collected on doubleagent.com. We collect information from our users at several
different points on our Web Site. For example, we collect personally identifying
information, such as your name, e-mail address, and date of birth, when you
register for Double Agent's newsletter (the "Newsletter"), enter
contests, or participate in other interactive online activities throughout the
Web Site. As described below, we may use such information to provide Newsletters
and other information and services to you, award prizes, or for promotional and
marketing purposes. We also collect non-personally identifiable information
(such as your IP address or domain) for purposes of site administration and to
compile aggregate information about usage of the Web Site. We may combine
personal information with such usage information or other information we obtain
from other resources.</p>

<div class="legal-group">TELL-A-FRIEND</div>
<p class="legal-text">If you elect to use our referral service for informing a friend about our
site, we will ask you for your friend's name and e-mail address. We will send
the friend an e-mail in response to your request inviting him/her to visit the
Web Site. This information is stored solely for the purpose of sending the e-
mail.</p>

<div class="legal-group">PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS</div>
<p class="legal-text">If you purchase a product from the Web Site, information may be collected
from you, including your credit card and contact information, for transfer to
and use by third party providers of the product. Unless otherwise stated, we do
not have any responsibility in connection with such purchase and all
transactions and use of any customer information are the sole responsibility of
the product provider. Be sure to review the product provider's privacy policy
and contact them directly if you have any questions.</p>

<div class="legal-group">SURVEYS AND CONTESTS</div>
<p class="legal-text">From time to time our Web Site requests information from users via surveys
or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary
and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this
information.</p>

<div class="legal-group">COOKIES</div>
<p class="legal-text">A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's computer tied to information
about the user. We may use either session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies.
For the session ID cookie, once a user closes the browser, the cookie simply
terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on a user's hard
drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by
following Internet browser help file directions. By showing how and when you use
the Web Site, cookies help us see which areas
are popular and which are not and help in targeting advertisements based on your
interests. Cookies also allow us to store the personal preferences that you set
during each visit to our site, which in turn allows us to speed up your future
activities at our site. The advertisements appearing on the Web Site are delivered
to you by a third-
party advertising network. In the course of delivering an advertisement to you,
the advertising provider may collect certain non-personally identifiable
information about your visits to this site through the use of cookies or similar
technology. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers on this site
as well. We do not control these cookies, and they are not subject to this
Privacy Policy. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser
to notify you when you have received a cookie, giving you the chance to decide
whether to accept it. You have the option to reject the Web Site's cookies and
still use the Web Site, but you may not be able to access or use some of the
features on the Web Site.</p>


<div class="legal-group">LOG FILES</div>
<p class="legal-text">Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet
protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to
analyze trends, administer the site, and report aggregate information to our
advertisers, our corporate affiliates or consultants, or with third parties that
perform a particular service on our behalf. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to
personally identifiable information, nor do we compile session activity reports
by IP address.</p>

<div class="legal-group">CLEAR GIFS (WEB BEACONS/WEB BUGS)</div>
<p class="legal-text">We employ or our third party advertising company may employ a software
technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), which help us better
manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs
are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and
are used to track the online movements of Web Site users. The main difference
between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much
smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. In addition,
we may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have
been opened by the recipients.</p>

<div class="legal-group">SHARING OF INFORMATION</div>
<p class="legal-text">For the purposes described above and to the extent permitted by law and
regulations, we may share your personally identifiable information with our
affiliates and other sites operated by and for Double Agent. We share aggregate
information with third parties for advertising and promotional purposes. We may
also disclose personal information in response to a request by law enforcement
personnel, a court order or subpoena, or to protect the integrity of our Web
Site if we believe that a user has committed unlawful or otherwise harmful
acts. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information in connection
with any merger or consolidation with, or sale of substantially all of our
assets, to an affiliated entity or third party, provided that such party agrees
to comply with our Privacy Policy or you are given a choice if such party would
like to use such information in a manner materially different from that
disclosed in our Privacy Policy.

</p><div class="legal-group">NEWSLETTERS</div>
<p class="legal-text">You may register for a periodic Double Agent newsletter, which we will
deliver to the e-mail address that you provide.</p>

<div class="legal-group">DEDICATED E-MAILS</div>
<p class="legal-text">In order to subsidize the Web Site and Newsletter, newsletter registrants
will occasionally receive dedicated e-mails from our affiliates ("Dedicated
E-mails"). These messages will be clearly marked as coming from Double
Agent.</p>


<div class="legal-group">CUSTOMER SERVICE</div>
<p class="legal-text">From time to time, we may communicate with you via e-mail to provide
services and information in regards to issues relating to your account.</p>

<div class="legal-group">CHOICE/OPT-OUT</div>
<p class="legal-text">If you no longer wish to receive our Newsletter, Dedicated E-mails, and
other communications from us, you may opt-out of receiving these communications
by replying to the e-mail newsletter with "UNSUBSCRIBE" (and only
"UNSUBSCRIBE") in the subject line or by following the
"unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the e-mail.</p>

<div class="legal-group">SECURITY</div>
<p class="legal-text">We have taken commercially reasonable measures to help prevent unauthorized
access, maintain data security, and to make proper use of the information that
we collect; however, no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to
be completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of any information you
provide to us.</p>


<div class="legal-group">DELETING PERSONAL INFORMATION</div>
<p class="legal-text">You can request to be removed from our active database by contacting Double
Agent Customer Support at support@doubleagent.com and unsubscribing from our
Newsletter. If you do so, we will delete your personal information from our
active database following our receipt of your cancellation request, unless we
determine in our sole discretion that we need to retain that information for a
longer period of time to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, enforce this
Privacy Policy, or Double Agent's Terms and Conditions, or for other valid
business reasons. Please note that we will not remove your historical usage
information from our aggregated files when we delete your user account.</p>

<div class="legal-group">NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES</div>
<p class="legal-text">We may, at our sole discretion, revise this Privacy Policy at any time in a
manner consistent with applicable law and regulations. When we revise this
Privacy Policy, we will incorporate the revisions into this Privacy Policy and
will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this web page. We
may also notify you by e-mail of any significant changes. Please check the Web
Site periodically for the most current version of our Privacy Policy. By using
the Web Site or continuing to receive our Newsletter after we have made any
modification or revision to the Privacy Policy, you agree to be bound by the
revised Privacy Policy.</p>

<div class="legal-group">MINORS</div>
<p class="legal-text">Our Web Site is not directed toward individuals under eighteen years old
("Minors") nor do we knowingly collect information from Minors. Minors
should not submit to or post on the Web Site any information.</p>

<div class="legal-group">LINKS</div>
<p class="legal-text">The Web Site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not
responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our
users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of
each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This
privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web
Site.</p>

<p class="legal-text">We use MaxOnline and other third-party
advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies
may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone
number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide
advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be

know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please

site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.</p>
