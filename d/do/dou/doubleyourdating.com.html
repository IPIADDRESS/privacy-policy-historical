    	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Read very carefully:</p>
<h2>Who do we contact?</h2>
<p>
          David DeAngelo Marketing Inc (DDMI)
          only contacts individuals who specifically request that 
          we do so or in the event that they have signed up to 
          receive our free newsletters or have purchased one of our products.</p>
<h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
<p>DDMI collects information in two categories:</p>
<p>
  <strong>1. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</strong>
</p>
<ul class="def">
  <li>name and e-mail address - provided by you for 
			registration to receive our free newsletters.</li>
  <li>name, postal address, phone and credit card 
			information -  provided by you when purchasing our 
			products. </li>
  <li>demographic information - used to improve our 
			marketing, products and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>All such information is strictly protected and used only for 
	delivering the content and products the user has signed up for or 
	purchased, or for finding other men and women who may find our 
	information valuable. This information is NEVER used for other purposes and is 
	NEVER shared with 3rd parties for their own use.</p>
<p>There is a single exception to this. Say you were subscribed to 
	some newsletter such as "modern world fashion" and the editors ran 
	a promotion of our site within it, and you followed over to our site, 
	then subscribed to our newsletter, then at a later date you 
	unsubscribed.</p>
<p>In that case, we have to provide back to "modern world fashion" 
	your email address, so they can exclude you from our future mailings. 
	No other information other than email address is provided and that 
	email address is used ONLY to suppress our future emails to you. 
	This scenario accounts for less than 1% of our newsletter subscribers.</p>
<p>A note about demographic information:</p>
<p>We contract with information providers to get this data so that 
	we can advertise to those who find our content relevant. This 
	technique is also called “database marketing”. It is 
	practiced by virtually every US corporation. Every US consumer can 
	assume that there is a fair amount of available data about them, 
	including personal data such as buying preferences and education level.</p>
<p>There is no central “opt out” place that we are 
	aware of. There are efforts underway to reach a standard that 
	would apply automatically based on browser settings.</p>
<p>Regardless of the state of privacy as a whole, you can avoid 
	us finding out extra demographic information about you by doing 
	the following:</p>
<p> 1. email us using our <a href="../contact.html">
		contact page</a></p>
<p> 2. in the subject line write: “Privacy - 
		opt out of demographic information”</p>
<p> 3. make sure you enter the same email that 
		you provided as customer or subscriber	</p>
<p>
  <strong>2. Anonymous Usage History (non PII)</strong>
</p>
<p>This information is strictly limited to the  history of activities 
	that the user engaged in while on our site.  it does NOT include any 
	personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
<p>For example, the string "sub+customer" in a cookie (see below for 
	what cookies are) might indicate that you are both a subscriber AND 
	a customer.</p>
<p>The purpose of this information is to improve your experience.</p>
<p>For example, by storing the fact that you are already a subscriber, 
	we do not need to bother you with an irrelevant  subscriber box.</p>
<p>Similarly, by noting that you are a customer, we can "bookmark" 
	the last video frames you watched in our member area and remind you 
	of this the next time you visit.</p>
<p>There is a small subset of this history that we use with 3rd 
	parties, such as Google, for the purpose of measuring and improving 
	the efficacy of advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>Some of these third parties, aggregate such information across 
	many websites. This allows them to identify users who are  more likely 
	to be interested in specific offerings like fashion, sports, education 
	and so on.</p>
<p>As an Internet user, you may experience the results of such 
	aggregation by noticing how the ads displayed on Yahoo, for example, 
	better match your  interests (the optimistic scenario), or at least 
	more closely match a website that you recently visited.</p>
<p>Whether you find this annoying and spooky or helpful and relevant, 
	or perhaps both, you are in good company. This area of Internet advertising 
	is new and controversial. The tradeoff between privacy vs. commercial 
	efficiency has a long history, for example the "Do not call" list.</p>
<p>In any event, it is likely that either the government or the industry 
	will adopt some form of "opt out" capability in the future to address 
	these concerns.</p>
<h2>What are cookies/clear GIFs and how
        do we use them?</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Cookies:</strong> Like many other commercial sites, our site 
        utilizes standard technologies called "cookies" and clear GIFs to collect 
        information about how our Site is used. A cookie is a small data text file, 
        which a website stores on your computer's hard drive (if your web browser 
        permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Cookies were 
        designed to help a website recognize a user's browser as a previous visitor 
        and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the 
        user was browsing the site. A cookie cannot be read by a website other than 
        the one that set the cookie. A cookie cannot pass on a computer virus or 
        capture any of the Personally Identifiable information.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Clear GIFs:</strong> At times, we work with third-party service 
        partners that employ clear GIFs (also known as pixel tags, single pixel GIFs, 
        web beacons or action tags) for our benefit to help us measure advertising 
        effectiveness. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar 
        in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of our 
        users. The main difference between the two is that clear GIFs are invisible 
        on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of 
        this sentence. Clear GIFs are not tied to your Personally Identifiable Information 
        and only track the visitor traffic and behavior to and on our Site.</p>
<p>Clear GIFs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both 
        from the same website or advertising company. That means, for example, that if 
        a person visited "www.companyX.com", which uses an advertising company's clear 
        GIF, the website would match the clear GIFs identifier and the advertising 
        company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. 
        This collected information can be shared with the advertising company. We do, 
        at times, provide such information to our third-party advertising service partners, 
        but that information never includes personally identifiable information.</p>
<h2>How do we store your email information?</h2>
<p>Your email information (email address, first name) is stored at the list 
        server that delivers DDMI 
        newsletters. Your information can only be accessed by those who help manage 
        those lists in order to deliver e-mail to those who would like to receive 
        DDMI's newsletters.</p>
<p>All of the newsletters that are sent to you by DDMI 
        include an unsubscribe link in them. You can remove yourself at any time from 
        our newsletters by clicking on the unsubscribe link. You can also unsubscribe 
        yourself at any time by <a href="/u/">clicking here</a>.
        </p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This policy may be changed at any time at DDMI's 
        discretion. If we should update this policy, we will post the updates to this 
        page on our Website. This policy was revised December 13, 2010.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy please 
        send us your question by <a href="../contact.html">going here</a>.
