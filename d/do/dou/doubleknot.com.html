													<h2>Privacy</h2>
													<p>We realize most 
													organizations, especially 
													those that include youth 
													membership, are very 
													concerned about privacy.&nbsp; 
													Keeping member information 
													secure, and using it only as 
													our members would want us 
													to, is a top priority. It is 
													Doubleknot's policy that all 
													your membership information 
													is confidential and owned by 
													your organization.&nbsp; 
													Doubleknot does not rent, 
													sell, or share personal 
													information about you or 
													your organization with other 
													people or other companies 
													except to fulfill products 
													or services you've 
													requested, comply with law 
													enforcement and to classify 
													your organization in our 
													list of member 
													organizations.&nbsp; Access by 
													you to your Member 
													Information is available 
													through a password and 
													unique user ID.&nbsp; By default, 
													from&nbsp; log in to log out, all 
													communication between our 
													server and your browser is 
													encrypted. </p>
													<p>Our list of member 
													organizations is accessed 
													from our home page at
													<a href="http://www.doubleknot.com">
													www.doubleknot.com</a>.&nbsp; If 
													you wish to remove your 
													organization from appearing 
													in our list of member 
													organizations you may do so 
													by contacting us with a 
													request to make your 
													organization private.&nbsp; The 
													request must come from the 
													primary contacted listed for 
													the organization and include 
													the organization name.&nbsp; This 
													request can also be 
													specified in the comment 
													section of our enrollment 
													form when enrolling your 
													organization.</p>
													<p>We do not advertise to 
													you, your members or anyone 
													you choose to provide with 
													information about your 
													organization other then to 
													communicate to organization 
													administrator's significant 
													changes to our service.&nbsp; 
													When we make or plan to make 
													significant changes to our 
													service we may inform and 
													solicit feedback from the 
													administrator's about these 
													changes.</p>
													<h2>Use of cookies</h2>
													<p>When you visit 
													Doubleknot's site we use 
													"cookies" to provide context 
													to your visit. A cookie is a 
													small amount of data that is 
													transferred to your browser 
													by a Web server and can only 
													be read by the server that 
													gave it to you. It cannot be 
													executed as code or deliver 
													viruses.<br>
													<br>
													Most browsers are initially 
													set to accept cookies. You 
													can set your browser to 
													notify you when you receive 
													a cookie, giving you the 
													chance to decide whether to 
													accept it. Cookies are 
													required to use Doubleknot.<br>
													<br>
													While Doubleknot uses 
													cookies to provide context 
													to your visit, and our Web 
													servers automatically log 
													the IP/Internet address of 
													your computer, Doubleknot 
													does not use this 
													information other then to 
													protect against ourselves 
													and our members against 
													fraud and illegal activity.&nbsp; 
													Doubleknot does use cookies 
													to "remember" the user ID 
													and, if you consent, 
													password you use to sign on 
													to the site.&nbsp; We store this 
													information solely to make 
													the sign on process easier.&nbsp; 
													Other cookies we use are 
													"session only" cookies and 
													are removed then your visit 
													to our site ends.</p>
													<h2>How We Secure 
													Information </h2>
													<p>Doubleknot protects 
													information in several ways.</p>
													<p>When you send 
													confidential personal 
													information to us on our Web 
													site, such as a credit card 
													information, member name or 
													user ID and password, secure 
													server software which we 
													have licensed encrypts all 
													information you input before 
													it is sent to us. The 
													information is scrambled en 
													route and decoded once it 
													reaches our Web site.&nbsp; By 
													default, when signed on or 
													making a payment, all 
													communication with&nbsp;us is 
													encrypted.&nbsp; Our secure 
													communication can be 
													verified when clicking on 
													the secure communications 
													seal on our payment screen 
													and at sign on. </p>
													<p>We also use encrypted 
													communications to transmit 
													information between us and 
													our service providers.&nbsp; For 
													example, to process credit 
													card payments we have a 
													secure connection to our 
													payment processor. </p>
													<p>For software, secure 
													communications and service 
													providers we only use well 
													known and established 
													companies generally 
													recognized a leader in their 
													field.&nbsp; For example, we use 
													GeoTrust, Inc. technology 
													for secure communications 
													and VeriSign, Inc. for 
													payment processing. </p>
													<p>We do not store or 
													maintain highly sensitive 
													information.&nbsp; This 
													information includes social 
													security and credit card 
													numbers.&nbsp; Where we are 
													required to collect this 
													information to fulfill a 
													product or service, we 
													immediately pass it on to 
													the service provider.</p>
													<p>To safeguard the 
													confidentiality of personal 
													information we collect from 
													unauthorized access or 
													disclosure our servers are 
													housed behind a firewall in 
													secure, restricted 
													access&nbsp;facilities with 24 
													hour surveillance.&nbsp; Only 
													named and authorized 
													representatives of 
													Doubleknot or our facility 
													management companies can 
													physically access our 
													servers.&nbsp; To secure data 
													from accidental loss, 
													alteration or destruction we 
													back up data on our servers 
													every four hours.&nbsp; In 
													addition, a record of all 
													our commerce transactions 
													are also kept by our payment 
													processor.</p>
													<p>All settlements for 
													online payment taken on 
													behalf of our member 
													organizations are securely 
													transmitted to our bank 
													account via Electronic Funds 
													Transfer.&nbsp; This account, 
													with CitiBank F.S.B.,&nbsp; has 
													specifically been 
													established to house funds 
													from our member 
													organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdraws on 
													this account require the 
													signature of two company 
													officers and internal policy 
													requires a documented funds 
													remittance request.&nbsp; For 
													organizations that have 
													provided us with proof&nbsp;they 
													have a federally recognized&nbsp; 
													tax exempt status in the 
													United States, funds 
													collected on your behalf are 
													deposited into an escrow 
													account in your 
													organization's name with 
													Citibank, F.S.B.&nbsp; CitiBank 
													F.S.B. is a part of 
													CitiGroup, Inc.</p></td>
