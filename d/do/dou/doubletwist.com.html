        <h4>4. To whom does doubleTwist transfer Your personal information?

        <p>Except as provided below, doubleTwist shall not sell, rent, trade or otherwise transfer any Personal and/or Traffic Data or Communications Content to any third party without Your explicit permission, unless it is obliged to do so under applicable laws or by order of the appropriate authorities.</p> 

        <p>doubleTwist may share Your information with its Affiliates.</p> 

        <p>In order to provide You with doubleTwist Services or other services You have requested, doubleTwist may share Your Personal Data and Traffic Data with partner service providers and/or agents (for example: social networks You elect to link to doubleTwist and/or the third party banking organization or other providers of payment services). doubleTwist will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational, confidentiality, security and technical measures to protect Your Personal Data and Traffic Data and to observe the relevant legislation.  Further, to the extent applicable, we require these entities to comply with this Privacy Policy. </p> 

        <p>Please be informed that, notwithstanding the above, in the event that doubleTwist has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of Personal Data is reasonably necessary to: satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request or enforce our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, or detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of doubleTwist, its users or the public as required or permitted by law, then doubleTwist will act according to that good faith belief, and reserves the right to share Personal Data with the appropriate parties, and cooperate with the appropriate legal entities. </p> 

        <p>Information collected on or through the Website or doubleTwist Software may be stored and processed in any country in which doubleTwist and its Affiliates maintain facilities, including outside of the European Union. In this regard, or for purposes of sharing or disclosing data in accordance with this article 4, doubleTwist reserves the right to transfer information outside of Your country.  By using the doubleTwist Software or other doubleTwist Services You consent to any such transfer of information outside of Your country. </p> 

        <p>As doubleTwist continues to develop its business, doubleTwist might sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions as well as in the event that doubleTwist or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, Personal Data of doubleTwist users will be one of the transferred business assets. We reserve the right to include Your Personal Data, collected as an asset, in any such transfer to a third party.  Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify You, either through email and/or a prominent notice on the Website.</p> 

        <h5>Third Party Advertising</h5> 
        <p>Advertisements appearing in doubleTwist Services may be delivered to You by our advertising partners.  Information such as the number of times You have viewed an advertisement (but not Your name, address, or other Personal Data), is used to serve advertisements to You.</p> 


        <a id="q5" name="q5"></a>
        <h4>5. What are cookies and how does doubleTwist use them?
            <span>(The technical kind, not the edible kind, ok?)</span></h4> 
        <p>Cookies are pieces of information that doubleTwist will transfer to Your computer's hard drive through Your browser to enable doubleTwist´s systems to recognize and enhance Your use of the doubleTwist Website. Cookies also enable doubleTwist to gain information about the use of its Website and to enhance the Website accordingly to the preferences of the users.</p> 

        <p>The Help option on the toolbar of most browsers will tell You how to prevent Your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify You when You receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. doubleTwist's cookies do not contain any identifying information. Please bear in mind that some personalized services may not be available if You choose to disable cookies.</p> 

        <h5>Third Party Cookies</h5> 
        <p>In the course of serving advertisements to the doubleTwist site, third party advertisers or their agents may place or recognize a unique cookie on Your browser.</p> 


        <a id="q6" name="q6"></a>
        <h4>6. How far does doubleTwist's responsibility extend?
            <span>(No, you don't have to get out of your seat to see this.)</span></h4> 
        <p>The Website may contain links that will let You leave the Website and access another website. Linked websites are not under the control of doubleTwist and it is possible that these websites have different privacy policies. As between the Website and other websites, this Privacy Policy applies solely to Personal Data that is acquired on the Website, so doubleTwist urges You to be careful when You enter any personal information online. doubleTwist accepts no responsibility or liability for these other websites.</p> 

        <p>The doubleTwist Services may also have message boards, forums and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.  When You post to a message board, forum or chat area, please be aware that the information You post is made publicly available on-line and You do so at Your own risk.  Additionally, please note that Your User Profile may be visible to other doubleTwist Services users and through third party websites, therefore, any Personal Data You disclose through the User Profile will be visible to other parties.  You should therefore not put any type of information that You do not with other users to see in Your User Profile.</p> 

        <a id="q7" name="q7"></a>
        <h4>7. How does doubleTwist protect Your personal information?
            <span>(Don't worry, we have all signed up for karate.)</span></h4> 
        <p>The Personal Data that You provide to us is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information.  In addition, we restrict access to Personal Data to doubleTwist employees, independent contractors and agents who need to know this information in order to develop, operate and maintain the doubleTwist Services.  All doubleTwist personnel who have access to this information are trained in the maintenance and security of such information.  However, no server, computer or communications network or system, or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect user information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information You transmit to us or through the use of any of the doubleTwist Services and You acknowledge and agree that You provide such information and engage in such transmissions at Your own risk.  Once we receive a transmission from You, we will endeavor to maintain its security on our systems.</p> 

        <a id="q8" name="q8"></a>
        <h4>8. doubleTwist Policy for Young People
            <span>(We'd love to be like your buddy's eccentric Aunt Stardust and let you do anything, but there are laws preventing that.)</span></h4>

If You are under the age of 13, You should not use the doubleTwist Services.  We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 13.
