Our primary purpose in collecting information is to provide You with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized

<br><br>

Except as provided below, doubleTwist shall not sell, rent, trade or otherwise transfer any Personal and/or Traffic 

Data or Communications Content to any third party without Your explicit permission, unless it is obliged to do so 

under applicable laws or by order of the appropriate authorities. 
<br><br>

doubleTwist may share your information with its Affiliates (as defined in the End User License Agreement). 
<br><br>

In order to provide You with doubleTwist Communication Services or other services You have requested, doubleTwist 

may share Your Personal and Traffic Data with partner service providers and/or agents (for example: social networks 

you elect to link to doubleTwist and/or the third party banking organization or other providers of payment 

services). doubleTwist will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical 

measures to protect Your Personal Data and Traffic Data and to observe the relevant legislation. 
<br><br>

Please be informed that, notwithstanding the abovementioned, in the event that doubleTwist has a good faith belief 

that access, use, preservation or disclosure of Personal Data is reasonably necessary to: satisfy any applicable 

law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request or enforce applicable Terms of Service, including 

investigation of potential violations thereof, or detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical 

issues, or protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of doubleTwist, its users or the public 

as required or permitted by law, then doubleTwist will act according to that good faith belief, and reserves the 

right to share Personal Data with the appropriate parties, and cooperate with the appropriate legal entities.
Information collected on the Website may be stored and processed in any country in which doubleTwist and its 

affiliates maintain facilities, including outside of the European Union. In this regard, or for purposes of sharing 

or disclosing data in accordance with this article 4, doubleTwist reserves the right to transfer information outside 

of Your country. 
<br><br>

By using doubleTwist Software or Communications Service You consent to any such transfer of information outside of 

Your country. As doubleTwist continues to develop its business, doubleTwist might sell or buy subsidiaries or 

business units. In such transactions as well as in the event that doubleTwist or substantially all of its assets are 

acquired by a third party, personal information of doubleTwist users will be one of the transferred business assets. 

We reserve the right to include Your personal information, collected as an asset, in any such transfer to a third 

party. 
<br><br>

<b>Third Party Advertising</b>
<br><br>

The advertisements appearing on doubleTwists website and the doubleTwist desktop may be delivered to you by our

address, or other personal information), is used to serve advertisements to you.
<br><br>

<a name="q5"><b>5. What are cookies and how does doubleTwist use them?</b></a>
<br><br>

doubleTwist to gain information about the use of its Website and to enhance the Website accordingly to the 

preferences of the users. 
<br><br>

The Help option on the toolbar of most browsers will tell You how to prevent Your browser from accepting new 

cookies, how to have the browser notify You when You receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. 

doubleTwists cookies do not contain any identifying information. Please bear in mind that some personalized 

services may not be available if You choose to disable cookies.
<br><br>

<b>Third Party Cookies</b>
<br><br>

<br><br>

The Website may contain links that will let You leave the Website and access another website. Linked websites are 

not under the control of doubleTwist and it is possible that these websites have a different privacy policy. The 

Privacy Statement applies solely to personal information that is acquired on the Website, so doubleTwist urges You 

to be careful when You enter any personal information online. doubleTwist accepts no responsibility or liability for 

these other websites.
<br><br>

<a name="q7"><b>7. How does doubleTwist protect Your personal information?</b></a>

revised Privacy Statement shall become effective within thirty (30) days of such publishing, but you can expressly 

accept the revised statement earlier by clicking on the accept button. You agree that the express acceptance by 

You, or Your continued use of the doubleTwist Software or Subscription Service after the notice period of thirty 

(30) days, shall constitute Your acceptance of the Privacy Statement.

<br>

<li><b>Feedback Information</b><br> 
Any and all information which is voluntarily submitted in feedback forms on the Website is reviewed and possibly 

used to improve the doubleTwist Software, Communications Service and Website. You acknowledge that any content, 

information, or ideas transmitted to doubleTwist may be used by doubleTwist at no cost, and that doubleTwist 

reserves the right to utilize anonymous information for marketing purposes, for instance by displaying selected 

comments on the Website or in other communications.</li>
<br>

doubleTwist may from time to time ask you to provide information on your experiences which will be used to measure

any Feedback Information that can personally identify You without Your explicit permission thereto.
<br><br>

a form that does not personally identify you, to provide You with better service, improve our products, provide

<br>
	
<li><b>E-mail addresses </b><br> 
doubleTwist respects the privacy of personal e-mail accounts and stores Your e-mail addresses just as securely as 

other Personal Data.  doubleTwist will not send You unwanted e-mail messages or junk mail, and Your details will not 

be passed to third parties for their marketing purposes without Your explicit permission. However, doubleTwist will

<br>

<li><b>Subscriber Information </b><br> 
doubleTwist asks for Subscriber Information in order to verify Your identity and to provide the doubleTwist Pro 

Service. We use third party banking organizations and other providers of payment services to bill You for the 

doubleTwist Pro Service and we will, therefore, provide this billing provider with the necessary billing data. 
Please note that Your billing data is sensitive information, which can be used to find out information about Your 

use of the doubleTwist Pro Service. Please be sure to keep this information safe and do not share it with 

others.</li>
<br>

<li><b>Traffic Data </b><br> 
In order to optimize network performance, doubleTwist collects Traffic Data. doubleTwist will erase Traffic Data, or 

make Traffic Data anonymous, as soon as it is no longer needed for the purpose of the transmission of the 

communication or for measuring bandwidth quotas, unless applicable law requires otherwise.</li>
<br>

<li><b>Security</b><br> 
Although doubleTwist has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information 

under our control, and we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we 

cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this 

information.</li>
