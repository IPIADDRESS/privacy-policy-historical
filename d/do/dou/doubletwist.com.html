        <a id="q7" name="q7"></a>
        <h2>7. How does doubleTwist protect Your personal information?</h2>

As a result, while we strive to protect user information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information You transmit to us or through the use of any of the doubleTwist Services and You acknowledge and agree that You provide such information and engage in such transmissions at Your own risk.  Once we receive a transmission from You, we will endeavor to maintain its security on our systems.</p>
