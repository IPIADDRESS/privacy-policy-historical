                <h3>Your Privacy Rights</h3>
                <p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes your privacy rights regarding our collection, use, storage, sharing, and protection of your personal information. It governs your participation on the eBayCommerce.com, Shopping.com, Epinions.com, DealTime.com, and PriceTool.com websites (including the versions of these sites in foreign jurisdictions), their sister sites, and all co-branded versions of these sites or any successor brand that eBay may designate from time to time inits discretion (in the United States or foreign jurisdictions), which are referred to collectively as the "eBay Commerce Network" or "ECN," along with their related sites, applications, services, and tools, regardless of how you access or use them, including through mobile devices. </p>
                <p>You accept this Privacy Policy when you sign up for, access, or use our products, services, content, features, technologies, or functions offered on our websites and all related sites, applications, and services (collectively "eBay Commerce Network Services"). </p>
                <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. Any such amendment shall take effect when such amendment is sent by email or posted on the eBay Commerce Network. Throughout this Privacy Policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and could be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it can no longer be used, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify a specific person. </p>

Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you have requested their services and will use your personal information in compliance with their Privacy Policy and our global privacy standards.</li>
                    <li>Service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as, but not limited to, fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs, site operations, and co-branded credit cards).</li>
                    <li>Other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service). On the eBay Commerce Network, you may have opportunities to express interest in or register for third-party products and services. If you do, we will provide information about you to the third party to implement your request;</li>
                    <li>Law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third parties, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other eBay Commerce Network user to legal liability.

                <h3>Information You Share on Site</h3>
                <p>Some portions of the eBay Commerce Network allow you to contribute ratings, reviews, tags, comments, and other content, either on one of our websites or via our product review services on other websites. This content may be displayed publicly on the eBay Commerce Network and elsewhere on the web. The reviews and comments you publish may be displayed with your member or user name. Registered members can publish reviews by logging in to their accounts; reviews submitted through our product review services cannot be deleted once uploaded. For some of our features, other members may be able to request email notifications of your new public content or publish their own comments to your reviews. You can also choose to make your wish lists private, but they are public by default. </p>
                <p>We may use the public content to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views, market products or identify or feature popular members. For example, we may promote most popular or highest-earning reviews and members. While we do not expect to transfer the complete review rating and web of trust database to others (except as discussed in this policy), we use the database throughout our network and to generate results for others.</p>
                <p>Your ECN User ID is displayed throughout the eBay Commerce Network (and so it is available to the public), and is connected to all of your ECN activity. This means that other people can see the feedback, ratings, and comments associated with your User ID. Notices sent to other community members about suspicious activity and policy violations on our sites likewise refer to specific User IDs. Therefore, if you associate your name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your ECN activities. </p>
                <p>If you access our sites from a shared computer or a computer in an internet café, you must log out of your account after use, or else certain information about you such as your User ID, activity, or reminders from eBay may be visible to other individuals who use the computer after you.</p>
