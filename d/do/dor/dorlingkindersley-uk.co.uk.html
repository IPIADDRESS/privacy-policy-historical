                  <span class="subhead">Who are you? <br>
                  </span> You know the answer to this one already, but we don't. 
                  So sometimes we will ask you to tell us, along with where you 
                  live, how we can get in touch with you (your email, your address) 
                  and what you like and don't like - your hobbies, your favourite 
                  authors, stuff like that. 
                  <p><span class="subhead">When are we going to bug you?<br>
                    </span> You've probably already seen on some pages of our 
                    web site that we ask you questions about yourself, we do that 
                    when: </p>

                      need for your email address so we can send it to you. <br>

                      you win and we can send you a prize! We might also want 
                      to tell other people that you won and maybe put up your 
                      entry on our web site. We'll ask you to tell us if we can

                    </li>
                    <li>You send us a review, poem, joke or story. If you do this 
                      and we decide to post it on the site, we'll need to know 
                      who and where you are so we can tell you: "We want your 
                      review on the site!" And so we can let other people who 
                      visit the site know who the bright spark was that wrote 
                      the review. <br>

                    <li>You post comments on our bulletin board. Then we'll need 
                      your name and email address so we can let other people know 
                      who's saying all those crazy things. <br>

                    </li>
                    <li> When you submit a review for the site. Then we ask for 
                      your name (that you want us to publish) and your email address 
                      (which we won't publish) so we can contact you about your 
                      review. <br>

                    </li>
                    <li>If you plan to send in a review or post comments on the 
                      site, ask a parent or other adult to check out clause 6 
                      of our General Terms and Conditions and to help you with

                    </li>
                    <li>You buy stuff, then we'll need to use your name, address 
                      and payment details to make sure we send you what you've 
                      bought. We may need to tell these to other people who help 
                      us to get your order to you too. Remember, you should get 
                      a parent or another adult to help you if you want to shop 
                      online. </li>

                  <p><span class="subhead">You tell us about yourself - then what?<br>
                    </span>If you come and visit our web site then we promise 
                    that we won't go telling anyone else the stuff you've told 
                    us. That would be pretty rude. The only time we'll share what 
                    you've said to us about yourself will be when we've already

                    We also want to make sure that when we collect information 
                    from children we do so in a way that does not infringe their

                    you useful information about your child's rights and the way
