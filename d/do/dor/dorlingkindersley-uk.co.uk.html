                      us to get your order to you too. Remember, you should get 
                      a parent or another adult to help you if you want to shop 
                      online. </li>

                  <p>When children want to participate in activities on our web 
                    site, this is the sort of information we ask for and how we 
                    use it: </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <ul class="mainbodycopy">
                   
                    <li>When children subscribe to receive any of our email newsletters 
                      we ask them for their email address so that we can send 
                      them the material that they have asked for. <br>
                      <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>On all informative emails and newsletters that we send, 
                      we give an option to unsubscribe. <br>
                      <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>When children enter competitions, we ask for their names 
                      and email and residential addresses. This is so that we 
                      can let them know if they have won anything, send them their 
                      prizes and also let other people (such as other users of 
                      our web site, the public and our own employees) know about 
                      our competitions and their winners. <br>

                    </li>
                    <li>When children send e-postcards, we will ask them for their 
                      names and email addresses. This is so we can let whoever 
                      receives the postcard know who sent it <br>
                      <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>When children send in reviews of our books, we will ask 
                      them for their names and email addresses. This is so that, 
                      if we want to post their reviews on our web site, and give 
                      them credit for what they have written. <br>

                    </li>
                    <li>If children submit reviews for display on the site, we 
                      ask for their names (as they would like us to publish them) 
                      and email addresses (which we will not publish) so we can 
                      contact them in relation to their reviews. If your child 
                      plans to submit a reviews to this site, please take note
