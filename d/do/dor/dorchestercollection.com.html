Types of personal data we collect</h4><i class="vc_toggle_icon"></i></div><div class="vc_toggle_content"><p><strong>How we collect data</strong> above explained the different ways we might obtain or receive data. Some of that data may be personal data, so please read below to understand the different types we may collect about you. Of course, the types of personal data we collect will depend on how you interact with us.</p><p><strong>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual, which can be used to identify that person. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</strong></p><p>We collect a variety of personal information about our guests, customers and visitors to our website. As our website is not intended for children, we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.</p><p>This personal data falls into these categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Identity Data</strong> includes title, gender, first name, maiden name, last name, marital status, date of birth, username or similar identifier and an encrypted version of your login/password. If you interact with us through social media, this may include your social media user name.</li><li><strong>Contact Data</strong> includes billing address, delivery address, email address and telephone numbers.</li><li><strong>Financial Data</strong> includes payment card and direct debit/bank account details.</li><li><strong>Transaction Data</strong> includes details about payments to and from you and other details of products and services you have purchased from us.</li><li><strong>Profile Data </strong>includes your username and password, purchases or orders made by you, your interests, preferences, feedback and survey responses, as well as any data which we have added (for example, using analytics and profiling).</li><li><strong>Technical Data</strong> includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access this website.</li><li><strong>Usage Data</strong> includes information about how you use our website, products and services.</li><li><strong>Tracking Data</strong> includes information we or others collect about you from cookies and similar tracking technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, and mobile identifiers.</li><li><strong>Marketing and Communications Data </strong>includes your preferences in receiving direct marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences.</li></ul><p>We also collect, use and share <strong>Aggregated Data</strong> such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does <strong>not</strong> directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature.</p><p>However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.</p><p>We do not ordinarily collect any <strong>Special Categories of Personal Data</strong> about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.&nbsp; The only exceptions to this are: (i) if you provide health data to us as part of a spa booking, we will use this to perform our contract with you, and we need your explicit consent to use your health data as part of that; or (ii) you have made the special category data obviously public.</p><p>Remember, if you choose not to share personal data with us, or refuse certain contact permissions, we might not be able to provide the products and services you’ve asked for.</p></div></div><div class="vc_toggle vc_toggle_default vc_toggle_color_default  vc_toggle_size_md"><div class="vc_toggle_title"><h4>5. Explaining the legal bases for using personal data</h4><i class="vc_toggle_icon"></i></div><div class="vc_toggle_content"><p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p><ul><li>Where we need to perform the <strong>contract</strong> we are about to enter into or have entered into with you. For example, when you make a booking at one of our hotels, that’s a contract.</li><li>Where it is necessary for our <strong>legitimate interests</strong> (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. For example, when we carry out fraud screening as part of the check-out process or take steps to keep our website secure.</li><li>Where we need to comply with a <strong>legal or regulatory obligation</strong>. For example, keeping records of our sales for tax compliance.</li></ul><p>When we are considering legitimate interests, we make sure we think about and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).</p><p>Generally, we do not rely on <strong>consent</strong> as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than where the law requires it, for example in relation to sending certain direct marketing communications. Where our legal basis is consent, you have the right to withdraw consent any time.</p><p>See <strong>How and why we use your personal data</strong> below for more detailed information.</p></div></div><div class="vc_toggle vc_toggle_default vc_toggle_color_default  vc_toggle_size_md"><div class="vc_toggle_title"><h4>6.

This is how we tell you about the hotels, services and events, and any special offers or promotions, we think you might be interested in.</p><p>To share our news, offers and services, we may use direct marketing by email, phone, text and post. Your direct marketing preferences are made clear on our website, and you can ask us about these any time via our <a href="https://www.dorchestercollection.com/en/contact/">contact page</a>.</p><p>You may choose to opt in to receive our newsletter on our website.

We may record these preferences, so when using these services please make sure you choose your marketing preferences correctly. As we have no control over the preferences which third party booking websites present to you, you should read their privacy policy.</p><p>We also work with partners to try and promote the reach of our adverts, using analytics and retargeting. To make sure the adverts you see on websites and social media are relevant, we use Tracking Data to see what you’ve looked at.</p><p>We want to give you the best Dorchester Collection experience online. Tracking Data, and in particular cookies, help us to do this by telling us which adverts will be most relevant to you and potential new guests on websites and social media. The cookies used for this purpose are often placed on our website by specialist organisations – and this is also why when you’ve been on the Dorchester Collection website, you might see content from our website again. This includes retargeting.</p><p>Cookies can also tell us if you’ve seen a specific advert, and how long it’s been since you have seen it. This is helpful, because it means we can control the effectiveness of our adverts and control the number of times people might be shown our adverts. Cookies also help us understand if you’ve opened a marketing email because we don’t want to send you things you won’t find interesting.</p><p>For more information about Tracking Data, in particular cookies, see <em><u><a href="#cookies">Cookies</a></u></em> below.</p><p>Almost all the cookies that relate to advertising are part of third party online advertising networks.

For example, when you make a booking at one of our hotels, that’s a contract.</li><li>Where it is necessary for our <strong>legitimate interests</strong> (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. For example, when we carry out fraud screening as part of the check-out process or take steps to keep our website secure.</li><li>Where we need to comply with a <strong>legal or regulatory obligation</strong>.

Advertising, marketing and your communications preferences</h4><i class="vc_toggle_icon"></i></div><div class="vc_toggle_content"><p>You could see our adverts in lots of different places, but it doesn’t always mean they’re using your personal data, because we also buy advertising space in the real world, on websites and on social media. If you see one of our adverts on a website and in social media, it may not be directed specifically at you and may simply be there because we’ve bid for the space.</p><p>To understand what we think you want, need or would be interested in, we may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Tracking, Usage and Profile Data to form a picture. This is how we tell you about the hotels, services and events, and any special offers or promotions, we think you might be interested in.</p><p>To share our news, offers and services, we may use direct marketing by email, phone, text and post. Your direct marketing preferences are made clear on our website, and you can ask us about these any time via our <a href="https://www.dorchestercollection.com/en/contact/">contact page</a>.</p><p>You may choose to opt in to receive our newsletter on our website. We may also be able to send you relevant direct marketing about our hotels, services and events unless you choose to opt out when making a booking with us, visiting our hotels or making a purchase via the gift shop.</p><p>Here are some examples of our direct marketing activities which may be directed specifically at you:</p><ul><li>our newsletter via email;</li><li>invitations and promotions by post, to tell you about special events at our hotels; and/or</li><li>phone calls, to tell you something that might be relevant to you or your business.</li></ul><p><strong>You can opt out of direct marketing at any time. </strong>The easiest way to do this is to click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of your email or contact unsubscribe.DCL@dorchestercollection.com</p><p>If a third party outside Dorchester Collection wants to use your personal data for their own direct marketing, we will always get your express opt-in consent first.</p><p>If you use a third party service to make a reservation at our hotels or restaurants, we may receive your marketing preferences from them. We may record these preferences, so when using these services please make sure you choose your marketing preferences correctly. As we have no control over the preferences which third party booking websites present to you, you should read their privacy policy.</p><p>We also work with partners to try and promote the reach of our adverts, using analytics and retargeting. To make sure the adverts you see on websites and social media are relevant, we use Tracking Data to see what you’ve looked at.</p><p>We want to give you the best Dorchester Collection experience online. Tracking Data, and in particular cookies, help us to do this by telling us which adverts will be most relevant to you and potential new guests on websites and social media. The cookies used for this purpose are often placed on our website by specialist organisations – and this is also why when you’ve been on the Dorchester Collection website, you might see content from our website again. This includes retargeting.</p><p>Cookies can also tell us if you’ve seen a specific advert, and how long it’s been since you have seen it. This is helpful, because it means we can control the effectiveness of our adverts and control the number of times people might be shown our adverts. Cookies also help us understand if you’ve opened a marketing email because we don’t want to send you things you won’t find interesting.</p><p>For more information about Tracking Data, in particular cookies, see <em><u>Cookies</u></em> below.</p><p>Almost all the cookies that relate to advertising are part of third party online advertising networks. If you’d like to read about how you can control which adverts you see online, see opt-out programs established by the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a> (United States), the <a href="https://youradchoices.ca/">Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada</a> and the <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance</a>. We do not control cookies which are set by advertising networks.</p></div></div><div class="vc_toggle vc_toggle_default vc_toggle_color_default  vc_toggle_size_md"><div class="vc_toggle_title"><h4>8.

Your legal rights</h4><i class="vc_toggle_icon"></i></div><div class="vc_toggle_content"><p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.

You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p><p><strong>Object to processing of your personal data</strong></p><p>This enables you to object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p><p><strong>Request restriction of processing your personal data</strong></p><p>This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p><p><strong>Request transfer of your personal data</strong></p><p>We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p><p><strong>Right to withdraw consent</strong></p><p>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p><p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please see <strong>How to contact Dorchester Collection about privacy </strong>below.</p><p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p><p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not shared with anyone who doesn’t have the right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for more information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p><p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
