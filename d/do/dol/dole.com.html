<br>
 This website is owned and operated by Dole Food Company, Inc. At
Dole, we recognize that many visitors to our Dole.com site are
concerned about the information they provide to us and how we treat
that information. In communicating directly with children over the
Internet, we also recognize the unique issues raised about
protecting your kids' privacy. Dole.com is designed to comply with
the guidelines for web sites established by the Children's
Advertising Review Unit, a division of the Better Business Bureau.
We may update this Policy as new technology of the Internet becomes
available.<br>
<br>
 If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, you can

<b>Privacy</b><br>
 Our overall policy is to use our best efforts to respect the
privacy of all of our on-line guests. Our web server recognizes and
records certain non-personal information about visitors;
specifically, this information consists only of the type of browser
used (e.g., Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer), the type of
operating system (e.g., Windows 95, Windows 98, Macintosh) and the
domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider (e.g.,
America On Line, Compuserve). This information is used only for
internal review purposes such as tracking the total number of
visitors to our site on an aggregate, non-personally identifiable
information basis. We do not access any personally identifiable
facts in this process<br>
<br>
 We do not collect personal information from visitors to our site
unless it is provided to us voluntarily and knowingly. One section
of our website is directed to children who are invited to visit
pages devoted to BOBBY BANANA, a copyrighted fanciful banana
character designed to appeal to children and to promote the
consumption of bananas as a healthy food source. Visitors to these
pages may receive educational information about bananas and
nutrition, hear BOBBY BANANA's radio and television jingles,
receive information about upcoming personal appearances by costumed
BOBBY BANANA figures and participate in other non-commercial
activities. These pages also include a BOBBY BANANA Fan Club which
children may join by providing their first names and an e-mail
address. In addition, if the registering guest is under 18 years of
age, we require the child to provide his or her parent's e-mail
address. The child's parent receives an e-mail alerting them to the
registration and providing instructions on how the registration may
be deleted, if so desired. Children are also specifically directed
on this page to obtain their parents' permission before providing
such personal information. Prospective Fan Club members are also
advised that any personal information provided will be used solely
to contact the sender about upcoming contests, Fan Club events and
Fan Club related e-mail. On another page of the BOBBY BANANA
section, children are invited to send an e-mail message to the
character and receive a non-commercial message back. Again, this
page contains an express advisory to children to obtain parental
consent before providing their e-mail address and requires a
parent's e-mail address. Notices are sent to the parent's e-mail
address with instructions on how to remove the child from the
mailing list, if so desired. Dole does not and will not use your
child's e-mail address for any purpose other than responding to the
message your child has sent or notifying him or her of Fan Club
events of interest.<br>
<br>
 From time to time, we sponsor contests for children in the BOBBY
BANANA pages. To enter, the child provides his or her first name,
city and state of residence and an e-mail address. The child's
first name and city and state are used solely to identify contest
winners on the website and the e-mail address is used solely to
enable Dole to notify contest winners. Any page in the site
announcing a contest will contain an express advisory to children
to obtain parental consent before providing any personal
information and to include a parent e-mail address. Notices will be
sent to the parents' e-mail address with instructions on how to
remove the child from any contest, if the parent so wishes.<br>
<br>
 Dole does not give or sell to any one any information we may
collect at our site.<br>
<br>
 <b>Links To Other Sites</b><br>
 The BOBBY BANANA pages of our site are not linked to other web
sites except to the Dole 5 A Day web site. This link is provided
for visitors who want more information about healthy and nutritious
eating. We do not provide links to any other sites in these pages
because we are concerned about sending any of our visitors, and
especially children, to any place on the Internet where we can't be
sure of its content.<br>
<br>
 <b>A Special Message for Parents</b><br>
 The Dole.com website is intended to be an information resource to
consumers, our shareholders, and potential investors. The BOBBY
BANANA pages are directed primarily to children and designed to
provide activities and information for children while promoting
awareness of the nutritional values associated with bananas.<br>
<br>
 In the BOBBY BANANA section of the website, plush toy dolls of two
of our fruit and vegetable characters are offered for sale. The
dolls may be ordered and purchased only by check through postal
mail. There is no on-line ordering and children are specifically
advised on this page that parental permission is necessary to make
any purchases. Parents are referred to this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
 Dole is concerned about personal privacy and is committed to
protecting the privacy of children who visit our site. We encourage
children to consult with parents before furnishing any personal
information and we incorporate special notices urging children to
obtain parental permission on those pages of our site where
children have an opportunity to provide an e-mail address. We
strongly recommend parents supervise their children's Internet
activities and consider using parental control tools available from
on-line services and software. These tools help parents maintain an
Internet environment appropriate for children. For additional
information about parental control tools, we suggest you consult
the Direct Marketing Association's (DMA) website at <a href="http://www.the-dma.org" target="new">www.the-dma.org</a>.</font></td>
