            <p>We respect the privacy of all of our on-line guests.  Our web server recognizes and 
            records certain non-personal information about visitors.  Currently, this information 
            may include the type of browser used (e.g., Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer), the 
            type of operating system (e.g., Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows NT, Linux, Macintosh) 
            and the domain name or ip address of the visitor's Internet service provider (e.g., America 
            Online, Compuserve, Earthlink), the number of users that visit a specific page on the Site 
            and the character and duration of such visits.  However, in the future, we may collect 
            other non-personal information as new technology for the Internet becomes available.  
            Non-personal information is used only for internal review purposes such as tracking the 
            total number of visitors to our Site on an aggregate, non-personally identifiable, basis.  
            This information may be used to help analyze site traffic and improve our services. 
            We may also aggregate such information to create statistical data and we may share that 
            information with potential advertisers, partners, affiliates and other third parties.  
            At no point, however, do we access any personally identifiable facts in this process.</p>
            <p>We do not require visitors to our Site to register or provide information in order 
            to view our Site. However, in certain circumstances, you may be asked to provide us 
            with some specific information about yourself in order to use or access certain features 
            on the Site, such as sweepstakes, contests, trivia games, rebate and coupon offers, surveys 
            and other promotions; to receive information from us in the future, such as newsletters; 
            or to fulfill a request or order for publications, merchandise or other information or 
            materials.  Such information may include contact information (such as your name, address, 
            telephone number and e-mail address), as well as other information we may require to carry 
            out certain features of the Site (such as demographic information, including age, gender, 
            hobbies, preferences, etc.).  We do not collect personally identifiable information from 
            visitors to our Site unless it is provided to us voluntarily and knowingly.  The personally 
            identifiable information you submit will be used: (i) to carry out your requests and respond 
            to your inquiries, and (ii) as otherwise disclosed at the point where such information is 
            collected or in any additional terms and conditions applicable to the particular feature 
            of the Site.  To accomplish this, we may share your personally identifiable information 
            with third parties that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners) 
            or who have joined us in providing promotions and activities, such as companies (including 
            retailers) or individuals that deliver packages, fulfill orders, participate in our 
            promotions, administer our promotions, provide diet and nutrition information, provide 
            marketing or promotional assistance, process credit card payments, analyze data or 
            provide customer service, but such information will be shared only to the extent these 
            third parties need such information to perform their functions.  </p>

            may also be used by us or shared with our subsidiaries and affiliates ("Dole Affiliates").  
            However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information 
            with Dole Affiliates by contacting us at the address listed below.</p>
            <p>We may also share your personally identifiable information with other companies that 
            are not affiliated with Dole and are not business partners of Dole, but would like to 
            provide you with additional products and/or services that we think may be of interest to 
            you.  However, your personally identifiable information will not be provided to these 
            unaffiliated third parties without prior approval from you either through an "opt-in" 
            choice at the point of collection or a response to a notification from Dole seeking 
            approval for to share your personally identifiable information with an unaffiliated 
            third party.  If you change your mind about the permission you have given through an

            potential partners, advertisers (who may use this information to provide advertisements 
            tailored to your interests) or other third parties, but we will not disclose any 
            personally identifiable information, except as provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <div class="sectionhead">FURTHER DISCLOSURE</div>
            <p>We reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable or non-personally 
            identifiable information if we are required to do so by law or if we reasonably 
            believe that such action is necessary in order to: (i) fulfill a government request; 
            (ii) conform with the requirements of the law or to comply with legal process served 
            on us; (iii) protect or defend the legal rights or property of Dole, Dole Affiliates, 
            this Site or its users; or (iv) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of 
            this Site's users or the general public.</p>
            <div class="sectionhead">CHILDREN UNDER 13</div>
            <p>Some activities on our Site are designed specifically for children and are 
            collected in a section of the Site called "Fun for Kids" ("Kids' Section").  
            We understand the concerns of parents regarding privacy, especially when it 
            comes to protecting information collected from children, and we strongly 
            encourage parents to supervise and participate in their children's online 
            activities and consider using parental control tools available through online 
            services and software. These tools help parents maintain an Internet environment 
            appropriate for children. </p>
            <p>Dole has developed the Kids' Section of this Site to be a fun and educational 
            - and safe - place for children to visit, and therefore, the Kids' Section of 
            the Site is operated in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection 
            Act ("COPPA") and supports the guidelines issued by the Council of Better 
            Business Bureaus' Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU).  We do not 
            request children under the age of 13 to provide more personally identifiable 
            information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity on the 
            Site.  Whenever we collect personally identifiable information from children, 
            we do so in compliance with the parental consent requirements of COPPA.  This 
            means that if we determine that a visitor is under the age of 13 (we may ask 
            for the visitor's birth date or age to do this), the personally identifiable 
            information provided will not be used or maintained without the consent of 
            the child's parent or guardian.  In certain circumstances, we may require 
            children under the age of 13 to provide us with the contact information for 
            their parent or legal guardian.  We will use this information to (i) notify 
            such parents or legal guardians of their children's participation in an 
            activity on the Site and of our privacy practices, and/or (ii) seek consent 
            to their children's participation in an activity on the Site.  Without his/her 
            parent's or legal guardian's permission, a child under the age of 13 may not 
            be able to participate in certain activities.  </p>
            <p>For example, in the Kids' Section, we may provide a special e-mail
            addrFor example, in the Kids' Section, we may provide a special e-mail 
            address so that children can send messages to us or to one of our fruit 
            or vegetable characters.  A non-commercial, informational message may be 
            sent back to the child. We do not and will not use or share your child's 
            e-mail address for any purpose other than responding to the message your 
            child has sent. The Kids' Section may contain a "chat room" where children 
            can participate in a conversation with one of our fruit or vegetable 
            characters.  A "screen name" will be collected from your child to be used 
            during the course of the chat session. This screen name is not personally 
            identifiable to your child.  Furthermore, the child is the only human 
            participant in the chat session. The chat session is not open to other 
            participants and the character's responses are provided by a software 
            program.  Once the child closes the chat session, the screen name is 
            immediately deleted and is not stored or maintained in any way.  Occasionally, 
            we sponsor educational, recipe or other contests for children on our Site.  
            In order to enter the contest via our Site, the child is required to provide 
            an e-mail and/or mailing address. Before allowing the child to participate 
            in the contest, we will obtain the consent of his/her parent or legal guardian.  
            This personal information is used solely to enable us to notify the contest 
            winners and will not be used or shared for any other purpose.</p>
            <p>The Kids' Section may offer visitors the opportunity to purchase products 
            or educational materials. Although on-line ordering of products is available 
            from sections of the Site directed toward adult visitors, products or materials 
            may not be ordered on-line directly from web pages directed toward children. 
            Mail-in order forms may be provided for printing out.  Children who access 
            the pages providing the opportunity to print out order forms are encouraged 
            to obtain their parent's permission before disclosing any personal information 
            or making a purchase decision.  </p>
            <p>We may also collect a child's name and e-mail address to the extent necessary, 
            as required or permitted by law, to protect against liability or to protect 
            the security of this Site.  Information collected for these reasons will not 
            be used for any other purposes. </p>
            <p>Dole does not currently give or sell any personally identifiable information 
            collected from children under the age of 13 on our Site to anyone, including 
            affiliated companies.  If we propose to share information with other parties, 
            we will notify the child's parent or legal guardian and will state with whom 
            we propose sharing information and why.  The child's parent or legal guardian 
            must consent to the disclosure of the their child's personal information before 
            it can be shared.  Parents may consent to Dole's collection and use of their 
            child's personal information without consenting to the disclosure of the 
            information to third parties, including affiliated companies.</p>
            <p>A parent or legal guardian can request that we remove, change or refuse 
            further submission of information relating to a child under the age of 13 
            by sending an e-mail to dole_consumercenter@na.dole.com or by contacting us 
            at the address listed below.  Any such request must contain the child's name, 
            address and e-mail address so we can locate such child's information.</p>
