<p><strong>1. INFORMATION COLLECTION</strong></p>
<p>There are several ways we may obtain information about you:</p>
<p><strong>Information You Provide To Us</strong></p>
<p><span>When you use the DSC Services, we may ask you to provide certain personal information to obtain our products or use our services. For example, we may ask for information when you register to create an account, update your information, sign up for a membership or subscription, use certain features, access, upload or download content, purchase products or services, enter into sweepstakes or other promotions, register or participate in a competition, fill out a survey, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. </span></p>
<p><span>We (or our service providers or business partners) may collect information that relates to you, including personal information, such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, phone number, mailing address, date of birth, gender, and demographic information.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Information You Provide When You Participate in an Online Survey or Other Research</em></strong><span>. We may also collect information you provide us in connection with participating in an online survey or as a research panel participant. This may include, but may not be limited to, information about your shopping habits, lifestyle preferences, interests and hobbies, health, physical or behavioral characteristics, or other demographic information, as well as photos, videos, and other user-generated content.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Information You Provide When You Make a Purchase</em></strong><span>. If you make a purchase from us, you will be required to provide a credit/debit card number and related financial information (such as CVV, expiration date, billing address, and phone number), or other payment information (such as via PayPal or Apple Pay), depending on the form of payment you choose.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Information You Provide about a Third Party</em></strong><span>. You may decide to provide us with another person's information (such as name, email, address, or phone number) so that we may recommend or send products or services to such person, or so that we may facilitate your communication with other people. Local law may require you to seek the consent of your contacts to provide their personal information to DSC (or in connection with using the DSC Services), which may in turn use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Where required by law, we will obtain the required consent from the person whose information you provided to us.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>[Information You Provide Through Social Media</em></strong><span>. You may also be given the option to link to your Facebook or other social media accounts through the DSC Services. When you do, we may automatically receive certain information from you based upon your privacy settings on those sites. This may include, but may not be limited to, name, user name, demographic information, updated address or contact information, location, interests, and publicly-observed data, such as from social media and online activity.</span></p>
<p><strong>Information Collected Automatically </strong></p>
<p><span>Whenever you visit or interact with the DSC Services, DSC, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about your online activity. This information may be collected in the following ways:</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Usage Information:</em></strong><span> We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, mobile analytics software, log files, or other technologies to collect certain information about your online activity, and interactions with our emails, online and mobile advertisements, and to allow us to keep track of analytics and certain statistical information which enables DSC to improve the DSC Services and provide you with more relevant content and advertising offered by DSC, or through or linked from the DSC Services. </span></p>
<p><span>For example, we may automatically or passively collect certain information from you, including your browser type, mobile device manufacturer, mobile carrier, phone number, operating system, activations, content, products or services you purchase or access, the page served and the preceding page views or websites visited, any mobile device activity and configurations, and email client.

We may automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“<strong>Device Identifier</strong>”) for the computer, mobile device, tablet or other device (collectively, “<strong>Device</strong>”) you use to access the DSC Services, including the hardware model and mobile network information. We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, provide the DSC Services, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users’ web page, email and mobile application movements/activities, help identify or gather broad demographic information for aggregate use, and retarget online and mobile advertisements to you across computers or devices you may use.</span></p>

In addition, if you choose to turn on your Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or other geolocation functionality when you use our mobile applications, we may collect and use your geolocation information.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Third Party Service Providers</em></strong><span>. We may use third party service providers to support the DSC Services. Some of these service providers may use technology such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, or other technologies to receive, collect, and store information on our behalf.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Third Party Analytic Technologies. </em></strong><span>We may use third parties’ analytics and tracking tools, such as Google Analytics, Adobe Marketing Cloud, Facebook Custom Audience and others, to help us track, segment and analyze usage of the DSC Services, and to help us or those third parties serve more targeted advertising to you on the DSC Services and across the Internet. These tools may use technology such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, Flash cookies, or other technologies to collect and store information. They may also combine information they collect from your interaction with the DSC Services with information they collect from other sources. We do not have access to, or control over, these third parties’ use of cookies or other tracking technologies.</span></p>
<p><span>To learn more about your advertising choices relating to the collection and use of your information, please see the <a href="#choice">Your Choices</a> section below.</span></p>
<p><strong>Information Received from Other Third Parties</strong></p>
<p><span>We may obtain information about you from other trusted third party sources to update or supplement the information that you provide or that we collect automatically. This includes, for example, information from public databases or data aggregators that may include your demographic information, media consumption, previous purchases, shopping habits, loyalty program information or lifestyle preferences. We may also receive information about you from our partners and service providers, (including, for example, business partners, analytics vendors, advertising networks and search information providers).</span></p>
<p><span>We may use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, personalize your experience with the DSC Services, target our communications so that we can inform you of products and services or other offers that may be of interest to you, to measure ad quality and responses, and and for internal business analysis or other business purposes. </span></p>
<p><strong>Combination of Information</strong></p>
<p>We may combine the information we receive from you and about you, including information you provide to us and information we automatically collect through the DSC Services, as well as information collected across other computers or devices that you may use, from other online or offline sources, and from third party sources. This combined information may be used in any manner detailed in this Privacy Policy.</p>
