</div>

This     Policy applies to our family of websites (the “<strong>Site(s)</strong>”). These include <span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.dollarshaveclub.com</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.dollarshaveblog.com</span> and     any other sites at which this Policy appears and the memberships that you can purchase on the Site to receive products that we offer or make available     through the Sites (“<strong>Membership(s)</strong>”). By using Our Sites and/or purchasing a Membership you consent to the collection, transfer,     manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us     at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">members@dollarshaveclub.com</span>.</p>
<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p>The information We collect from you enables us to fulfill your request for our products (razors and/or other grooming products that you order and receive     through your Membership), to send you information or content in which you may be interested, and keep you abreast of any updates related to our Site and     your Membership. We also use this information to personalize and continually improve our Site, your experience, and to ultimately serve you better.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected Upon Registration:</strong> You may browse our Site without registering. If you would like to place an order, become a member, and/or request information from us then we require you     to register with us and become a member on our Sites. When you create, register, or edit your DSC account, you provide some personal information, such as     your name, email address, and password. Please safeguard your password and other personal information. You may be liable for unauthorized use of our web     site, as well as have your private information used by others. In some circumstances, such as making a purchase of our products, we will request that you     provide your credit card, debit card, or acceptable payment option and your billing address and shipping address. You are welcome to not provide this     information, but if you do not wish to provide this information then there is no way for us to provide you with our products and Services and therefore you     cannot become a member.</p>
<p><strong>Information that We Collect About You from Facebook: </strong> You may also log-in to our Site using your Facebook account. Facebook controls the information collected from you during the log-in process; DSC does not     control the information that Facebook collects from you. If you log-in to our Site using Facebook, you must enter your Facebook email address and password.     We will also ask that you grant us permission to (i) access and collect your Facebook basic information (this includes your name, profile picture, gender,     networks, user IDs, list of friends, date of birth, email address, and any other information you have you have set to public on your Facebook account);     (ii) send you email; (iii) post to your Wall; (iv) access posts in your news feed; and (v) access your Facebook data at any time even if you are not using     Facebook. Please note if you allow DSC to have access to this information, then DSC will have access to this information even if you have chosen not to     make that information public. For information about how Facebook may disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult     the Facebook Privacy Policy. We have no control over how Facebook uses or discloses the personal information you provide to it. We store the information     that we receive from Facebook along with other information that we collect from you or receive about you.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect Automatically:</strong> In addition, when you visit the Sites and/or register for Membership, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies, web beacons,     and other automated devices. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor‘s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify     the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is used to     transmit information back to a web server. We also may use third-party website analytics tools (such as Omniture, Google Analytics, and Facebook Insights),     that collect information about visitor traffic on the Sites. The information we may collect by automated means includes:</p>
<ul>
<li> Information about the devices our visitors use to access the Internet (such as the IP address and the device, browser, domain name and operating system     type)</li>
<li> URLs that refer visitors to our sites</li>
<li> Dates and times of visits to our sites</li>
<li> Information on actions taken on our sites (such as page views and site navigation patterns)</li>
<li> A general geographic location (such as country and city) from which a visitor accesses our websites</li>
<li> Search terms that visitors use to reach our sites and the webpage that led you to the Sites</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cookies and other Tracking Technology: </h2>
<p><strong>Cookies Information:</strong> Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track information about     your use of the Service. DSC uses cookies to help recognize you as a repeat visitor, to improve the quality of our Service, and to try and make your     browsing experience meaningful. When you enter our Sites, our web server sends a cookie to your computer which allows us to recognize your computer but not     specifically who is using it. By associating the identification numbers in the cookies with other customer information when, for example, you log-in to the     Service, then we know that the cookie information relates to you. Some of the cookies used by our Service are served by us, and some are served by third     parties who are delivering services on our behalf. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to     prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting <span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.allaboutcookies.org</span> which includes     additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different browsers. By blocking or deleting cookies used on our Service, you may     not be able to take full advantage of our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Local Storage Objects:</strong> We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) in order to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from     browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. In addition, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through     your browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash cookies, go to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adobe Flash Player Help Page</span>, choose “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Global Storage Settings Panel</span>” and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Website Storage Settings Panel</span>” and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.</p>
<p><strong>Log File Information or Log Data: </strong> Our servers automatically record information ("<strong>Log Data</strong>") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as     your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search     terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services,     interact with our email notifications, or visit a third-party website that includes a DSC button or widget. DSC uses Log Data to provide our Services and     to measure, customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or     remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Gifs Information</strong> : When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No     personally identifiable information from your DSC account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails     sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of     our marketing, and make DSC better for our users.</p>
<p><strong>Site Analytics:</strong> As noted, we may use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site. We also may use other analytic means to     evaluate our Site. We use these tools to help us improve our Site, performance and user experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Links:</strong> DSC may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by     redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate     click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Ad Networks</strong> : We may use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on Our Sites. We may display advertisements on Our Sites, participate in     third party ad networks and make available to Our Sites users specific offers from third-party companies. Some of the advertisements you see on the Sites     are delivered by third parties who also collect information through <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cookies, web beacons, and other technologies</span> about your online activities,     either on Our Web Sites or across the Internet, in an effort to understand your interests and deliver you advertisements that are tailored to your     interests. These third parties include advertisers, advertising agencies, and ad networks that may collect information when you view or interact with one     of their advertisements. Third parties that currently collect information on our Sites for the purpose of serving you with advertising tailored to your interest include, but are not limited to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Atlas</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BlueKai</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">DoubleClick</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">EyeWonder</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Google</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mediamind</span>,    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Audience Science</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pointroll</span>. These companies may offer you a way to choose not to have your information used for advertising purposes. You     can find more information by clicking on the company names above and following the links to each company's web site.</p>
<p>In addition, some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), which offers a single location to opt out of receiving     tailored ads from member companies. To opt out of information collection by NAI member companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use     or their own privacy policies, please visit the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NAI consumer opt out page</span>. Also, through the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"), several media and     marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are     customized based on their online behavior across different Web Sites. CBS Interactive is committed to complying with the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more and make choices about interest-based ads from participating third parties, please visit the<span style="text-decoration: underline;">DAA consumer opt out page</span>. In the UK, the Internet Advertising Bureau ("IAB UK") has developed    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good Practice Principles for Online Behavioural Targeting</span>. More information and an opt out page to manage online behavioral advertising preferences     with IAB UK member companies are available at<span style="text-decoration: underline;">YourOnlineChoices.com</span>. Please note that if you choose to opt out of having your information used to     deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, you will continue to see advertisements on our Web Sites, but these advertisements may not be as     relevant to you.</p>

<h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
<p>We are committed to protecting the information we receive from you. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the     confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on Our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we have     implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.     <strong> We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions, including, where appropriate, password protection, encryption, SSL, firewalls, and internal         restrictions on who may access data to protect our Site and the information </strong> We<strong> collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</strong> The Sites encrypt your credit card number, debit card number, or other payment option and other personal information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology to provide for the secure transmission    <strong> of the </strong>information from your personal computer to Our servers. In addition, only those employees and third parties who need access to you     information in order to perform their duties are allowed such access. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone,     and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping     your password private. Also, you should never share your log-in information with others. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised     passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity. To change your Facebook password, you must go to the Facebook site and     follow its procedures for changing your password.</p>

If you would     like to access or modify your Facebook profile information, or adjust the types of information we receive from Facebook, you must adjust your Facebook     account settings directly through Facebook.

You may make one request per calendar year. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a     current California address for your response.
