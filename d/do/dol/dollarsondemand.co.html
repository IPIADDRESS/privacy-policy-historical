						<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">How we gather 
						information from users:<br>
						<br>
						How we collect and store information depends on the page 
						you are visiting. Like most Web sites, this website 
						collects information automatically and through the use 
						of electronic tools that may be transparent to our 
						visitors. <br>
						For example, we may log the name of your Internet 
						Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize 
						you and hold information from your visit.<br>
						<br>
						What we do with the information we collect:<br>
						<br>
						Like other Web publishers, we collect information to 
						enhance your visit and deliver more individualized 
						content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do 
						not share your information with anyone.<br>
						<br>
						Aggregated Information (information that does not 
						personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For 
						example, we may combine information about your usage 
						patterns with similar information obtained from other 
						users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to 
						learn which pages are visited most or what features are 
						most attractive).<br>
						<br>
						We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected 
						on the website to communicate with you about your 
						registration; our privacy policy; services and products 
						offered by this website and other topics we think you 
						might find of interest. <br>

						Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements: <br>

						This website expects its partners, advertisers and

						aware, however, that third parties, including our 
						partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content 
						providers accessible through our site, may have their 
						own privacy and data collection policies and practices. 
						For example, during your visit to our site you might 
						click a link to, or view as part of a frame, page, 
						certain content that is actually created or hosted by a 
						third party. Also, through this website you may be 
						introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web 
						sites, features offered by other parties. This website 
						is not responsible for the actions or policies of such

						delete that information immediately. If you believe that 
						we have any information from or about anyone under 13, 
						please contact us at the email address listed below. 
						Only persons 18 years of age and older and who qualify

						While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners 
						or other third parties may use cookies or other 
						technology to attempt to identify some of your 
						preferences or retrieve information about you. For 
						example, some of our advertising is served by third 
						parties and may include cookies that enable the 
						advertiser to determine whether you have seen a 
						particular advertisement before. Other features 
						available on our site may offer services operated by 
						third parties and may use cookies or other technology to 
						gather information. We do not control the use of this 
						technology by third parties or the resulting 
						information, and we do not accept responsibility for any 
						actions or policies of such third parties. <br>
						<br>
						You should also be aware that if you voluntarily 
						disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message 
						boards or in chat or comment areas, that information can 
						be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by 
						third parties without our knowledge and may result in 
						unsolicited messages from other individuals or third 
						parties. Such activities are beyond the control of this 
						website. <br>
