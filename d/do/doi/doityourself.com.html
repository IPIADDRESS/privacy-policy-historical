<h4><span style="font-weight: 400"><font face="Arial" size="2">DoItYourself.com 
Inc. and its warehouse affiliate 
DoItYourselfWarehouse.com Inc. have created this privacy statement in order
to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to disclose our information
gathering and dissemination practices. Questions regarding this statement should
be directed to the Webmaster by emailing <a href="mailto:webmaster@doityourself.com">webmaster@doityourself.com</a>. </font>
</span> </h4>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Privacy Policy</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">DoItYourself.com Inc. is a leading 
provider of home improvement and repair information on the Internet 
and DoItYourselfWarehouse.com Inc. provides e-commerce solutions for individuals and businesses. We invite you to 
explore our Web sites and find out what all the talk is about. </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> 
</h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our websites log IP addresses and browser types, but we do 
not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that  
users sessions are tracked, but the user remain anonymous.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You can browse our site without entering any personal 
information and therefore remain anonymous during your visit. However, we hope 
that our visitors will register with us so that we can learn more about 
our valuable customers. Our registration form asks users for name, email 
address, preferences, and some limited demographic information. We encourage 
all visitors to register with us in our Community Forums or our ecommerce cart.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We maintain a separate list of email addresses which 
are used to 
send our newsletters containing news about the subjects you and fellow 
readers have asked us about as well as our and specials. If you would rather not receive the newsletter(s), but 
would still like to register, you may register in our forums, but not in our 
newsletter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Preferences and demographic information are used to help us 
improve our service and products. The more we know about you, the better we can 
serve you. Visitors may choose to voluntarily "Sign In", or request our Free 
online newsletter, use the Tell a Friend feature, complete a Visitor Survey, 
enter our contests, or request information from us. If so, we may on our own 
behalf send you Email, copies of our Free newsletters or surveys. (We will 
delete your Email address on request.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The only other place that we collect personal information on 
our Web site is on the order forms, which ask for billing information such as 
name, postal address, email address and credit card number should you decide to 
place an order. </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Use of the Information this Site 
Gathers/Tracks</font><font size="2" face="Arial"> </font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our Website logs IP addresses for systems administration 
purposes and these logs are analyzed to constantly improve the value of the 
materials available on the website. </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Surveys and Relationships</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information 
(like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, 
age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user 
information about our company. Demographic and profile data is also collected at 
our site. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate 
basis. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Company maintains special relationships, with various strategic partners, business 
partners, and operates several co-branded sites. For Example Socratic Inc. maintains 
a paid by incentives panel known as "The DoItYourself.com Advisors" at
<a href="http://panel.doityourself.com">http://panel.doityourself.com</a>. This 
and other co-branded 
site may gather additional information; the Company sometimes has access to 
some or all of the information, and the Company's partner's use of the 
information is not within the Company's control. </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Forums</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our Community Forums allow users to view without 
registering. We require visitors to register before posting so we can track the quantity of 
questions and answers, and to recognize longer standing with member status 
instead of visitor or apprentice. We also have a number of volunteer forum 
moderators. The information posted therein is therefore not in our control. For 
those visitors who do register, they have the ability to edit their posts after 
posting, receive an email when a question is answered. These choices are optional, and 
are selected by each member individually. The same conditions will apply to the 
ability to post article and product reviews.&nbsp; </font></p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Order Form</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The information that we require on our order form is only 
used to process your orders quickly and accurately. Your contact information 
is used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing 
information will only be used to bill you for that product. This information may 
be used for marketing purposes by us. The customer's contact information is also 
used to contact the visitor when necessary. We do not sell or distribute 
telephone numbers, except to the carriers involved in delivering your packages 
and only to facilitate delivery. Users may always opt-out of receiving 
future emails. </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Sharing of the Information this Site 
Gathers/Tracks</font><font size="2" face="Arial"> </font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For those visitors who register with us, we may share your 
name, email address, preferences, and demographic information with select 
partners so they can present you with special offers. Though, as mentioned 
above, you may tell us that you don't want your information shared, in which 
case we will of course respect your wishes. Please see the Opt-out section 
below. The information that you submit on the order form (contact and billing 
information) is never shared with any third parties, including our 
partners. </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Security</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When you place an order online, your personal information 
and credit card information are scrambled using encryption technology before 
being sent over the Internet. This makes it virtually impossible for your 
information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred through 
cyberspace. When we receive your order, it is kept encrypted behind a firewall until we're ready 
to process it. In addition, we erase most of your credit card information from our web 
site database so it is therefore safe from 
"hackers." </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Links and Linked Sites</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our website contains links which may including framing in of 
pages from other Web sites we have selected. We also maintain a database where 
visitors can post Community Links. This area includes a visitor rating 
system.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Please be aware that our privacy policy does not apply to 
these linked sites. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement 
whenever interacting with any Web site.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Cookies</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our site uses cookies to keep track referrals and items in 
our shopping 
cart system and to provide our visitors with a tailored user experience. With the help 
of cookies, we can present customized content and ads that will be of more 
interest. We also use cookies in our Community Forums to remember members 
passwords so they don't have to re-enter them each time they visit the site. You 
have the option of setting your browser to reject cookies. However, if certain 
cookies that track your purchase are rejected then we won't be able to keep 
items in your cart from visit to visit and you will have to reenter some 
information on every visit. We do not maintain credit card numbers between visits. </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Advertiser Cookies</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You may be served cookies from our advertisers or 
their advertising agencies while visiting our site. We do not control, nor do we have 
access to any of the information they may collect. </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Opt-out Policy, Correcting and 
Updating</font><font size="2" face="Arial"> </font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If at any time after registering, you change your mind about 
receiving the newsletter or sharing your information with third parties, you may 
visit the site and unsubscribe automatically from the link on every content 
page. You may also use this feature to delete an old email address or add a new 
one.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">General Advice</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, although </font><span style="font-weight: 400"><font face="Arial" size="2">DoItYourself.com 
Inc. and its warehouse affiliate 
DoItYourselfWarehouse.com Inc.</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"> have a very strong Privacy 
Protection policy on our end, and do their utmost to protect privacy of all 
visitors, we bear no responsibility for anyone else's conduct with respect to 
material you transmit.&nbsp; As is true with ANY Internet usage and access to ANY 
Website, if you are using someone else's computer, or someone else has access to 
your computer, or spy ware is resident on your computer, or you are using a corporate or other "network", it may be 
possible for that "someone else" or the "network" operator to retrieve copies of 
Email you sent from the computer and/or to trace the places you have been 
visiting on the Internet. </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Amendments</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We may amend this Privacy Policy on a prospective basis 
(i.e., for future visits) at any time by posting a revised policy on our Web 
site. Further, nothing in this Privacy Policy is designed to protect the privacy 
of visitors whose use of the Company's Website is, in our opinion, or that of 
our attorneys or affiliates is intended for illegal, improper or abusive 
purposes, for purposes of marketing or solicitation, or would violate any other 
terms and conditions relating to use of the Web site. </font> </p>
