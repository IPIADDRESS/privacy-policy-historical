Privacy Statement</font></h3><br clear="all">
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">DoItYourself.com has created this privacy statement in order 
to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to disclose our information 
gathering and dissemination practices. Questions regarding this statement should 
be directed to the Webmaster by emailing <a href="mailto:webmaster@doityourself.com">webmaster@doityourself.com</a>. </font> 
</p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Privacy Policy</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">DoItYourself.com (sometimes "us", "our", "we") is a leading 
provider of home improvement and repair information and advice on the Internet 
and e-commerce solutions for individuals and businesses. We invite you to 
explore our Web site and find out what all the talk is about. </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> 
</h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our web site logs IP addresses and browser types, but we do 
not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a 
user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You can browse our site without entering any personal 
information and therefore remain anonymous during your visit. However, we hope 
that all of our visitors will register with us so that we can learn more about 
our valuable customers. Our registration form asks users for name, email 
address, preferences, and various types of demographic information. We encourage 
all visitors to register with us in our Community Forums.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We maintain a separate list of email address which we use to 
send you our newsletter containing news about the subjects you and fellow 
readers have asked us about. If you would rather not receive the newsletter, but 
would still like to register, you may register in our forums, but not in our 
newsletter. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Preferences and demographic information are used to help us 
improve our service and products. The more we know about you, the better we can 
serve you. Visitors may choose to voluntarily "Sign In", or request our Free 
online newsletter, use the Tell a Friend feature, complete a Visitor Survey, 
enter our contests, or request information from us. If so, we may on our own 
behalf send you Email, copies of our Free newsletters or surveys. (We will 
delete your Email address on request.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The only other place that we collect personal information on 
our Web site is on the order forms, which ask for billing information such as 
name, postal address, email address and credit card number should you decide to 
place an order online. </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Use of the Information this Site 
Gathers/Tracks</font><font size="2" face="Arial"> </font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our Website logs IP addresses for systems administration 
purposes and these logs are analyzed to constantly improve the value of the 
materials available on the website. </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Surveys and Relationships</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information 
(like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, 
age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user 
information about our company. Demographic and profile data is also collected at 
our site. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate 
basis. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Company maintains special relationships, such as our 
email service "Powered by Everyone.net" with various strategic partners, business 
partners, and operates several co-branded sites. The operators of the co-branded 
sites may gather additional information; the Company sometimes has access to 
some or all of the information, and the Company's partner's use of the 
information is not within the Company's control. </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Bulletin Boards</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our Community Bulletin Boards allow users to view without 
registering. We ask visitors to register when posting so we can track the quantity of 
questions and answers, and to recognize longer standing with member status 
instead of visitor or apprentice. We also have a number of volunteer forum 
moderators. The information posted therein is therefore not in our control. For 
those visitors who do register, they have the ability to edit their posts after 
posting, receive an email when a question is answered. These choices are optional, and 
are selected by each member individually. Registrants on the Forum do not get 
newsletters unless they subscribe as well.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Order Form</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The information that we require on our order form is only 
used to process your orders quickly and accurately. Your contact information 
will only be used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing 
information will only be used to bill you for that product. This information may 
be used for marketing purposes by us. The customer's contact information is also 
used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving 
future mailings. </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Sharing of the Information this Site 
Gathers/Tracks</font><font size="2" face="Arial"> </font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For those visitors who register with us, we may share your 
name, email address, preferences, and demographic information with select 
partners so they can present you with special offers. Though, as mentioned 
above, you may tell us that you don't want your information shared, in which 
case we will of course respect your wishes. Please see the Opt-out section 
below. The information that you submit on the order form (contact and billing 
information) is never shared with any third parties, including our 
partners. </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Security</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When you place an order online, your personal information 
and credit card information are scrambled using encryption technology before 
being sent over the Internet. This makes it virtually impossible for your 
information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred through 
cyberspace. When we receive your order, it is kept encrypted until we're ready 
to process it. In addition, we erase your credit card information from our web 
site database so it isn't connected to the Internet, and is therefore safe from 
"hackers." </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Links and Linked Sites</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our website contains links which may including framing in of 
pages from other Web sites we have selected. We also maintain a database where 
visitors can post Community Links&nbsp; This area includes a visitor rating 
system.&nbsp; </font> </p>

these linked sites. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement 
whenever interacting with any Web site.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Cookies</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our site uses cookies to keep track referrals and items in 
our shopping 
cart system and to provide our visitors with a tailored user experience. With the help 
of cookies, we can present customized content and ads that will be of more 
interest. We also use cookies in our Community Forums to remember members 
passwords so they don't have to re-enter them each time they visit the site. You 
have the option of setting your browser to reject cookies. However, if certain 
cookies that track your purchase are rejected then we won't be able to keep 
items in your cart from visit to visit and you will have to reenter some 
information on every visit. We never maintain credit card numbers between visits. </font> </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006699">Advertiser Cookies</font><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </h4>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You may be served cookies from our advertisers or 
advertising agencies while visiting our site. We do not control, nor do we have

Updating</font><font size="2" face="Arial"> </font> </h4>
