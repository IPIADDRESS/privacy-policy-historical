class="headline_area"><h1>Privacy Policy</h1></div><div class="format_text"><p></p><p>March 12, 2011</p><h2><p style="text-align: center;">General</p></h2><p>Dog Food Advisor (“Company” or “we” or “us” or “our”) respects the privacy of its users (“user” or “you”) whether they use our website located at www.DogFoodAdvisor.com, including other media forms and media channels related or connected thereto (collectively, the “Website”) to access information and reviews about dog food, access our directory of establishments selling dog food and related supplies, or to simply view the Website.</p><p>The following Company privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to inform you, as a user of the Website, about the types of information that Company may gather about or collect from you in connection with your use of the Website.</p><p>It also is intended to explain the conditions under which Company uses and discloses that information, and your rights in relation to that information.</p><p>Changes to this Privacy Policy are discussed at the end of this document. Each time you use the Website, however, the current version of this Privacy Policy will apply.</p><p>Accordingly, each time you use the Website you should check the date of this Privacy Policy (which appears at the beginning of this document) and review any changes since the last time you used the Website.</p><p>Our Website is hosted in the United States of America and is subject to U.S. state and federal law.</p><p>If you are accessing our Website from other jurisdictions, please be advised that you are transferring your personal information to us in the United States, and by using our Website, you consent to that transfer and use of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p><p>You also agree to abide by the applicable laws of applicable states and U.S. federal law concerning your use of the Website and your agreements with us.</p><p>Any persons accessing our Website from any jurisdiction with laws or regulations governing the use of the Internet, including personal data collection, use and disclosure different from those of the jurisdictions mentioned above may only use the Website in a manner lawful in their jurisdiction.</p><p>If your use of our Website would be unlawful in your jurisdiction, please do not use the Website.</p><p>BY USING OR ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Children</p></h2><p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) protects the online privacy of children under 13 years of age.</p><p>We do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from anyone under the age of 13, unless or except as permitted by law.</p><p>Any person who provides personal information through the Website represents to us that he or she is 13 years of age or older.</p><p>If we learn that personal information has been collected from a user under 13 years of age on or through the Website, then we will take the appropriate steps to cause this information to be deleted.</p><p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a member of the Website or has otherwise transferred personal information to the Website, please contact Company using our contact information below to have that child’s account or access terminated and information deleted.</p><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Gathering, Use and Disclosure<br> of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</p></h2><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Users of Website Generally</p></h2><p>“Non-Personally-Identifying Information” is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person.</p><p>“Personally-Identifying Information,” by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person.</p><p>Like most website operators, Company gathers from users of the Website Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that Web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available.</p><p>That information includes the user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, and the locations of the Web pages the user views right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website.</p><p>Company analyzes Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website to help Company better understand how the Website is being used.</p><p>By identifying patterns and trends in usage, Company is able to better design the Website to improve users’ experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use.</p><p>From time to time, Company may also release the Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Website users in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.</p><p>We may also periodically obtain both Personally-Identifying Information and Non-Personally-Identifying Information about you from other Company-affiliated businesses, business partners, contractors and other third parties and add it to our account information or other information we have collected.</p><p>Examples of information that we may receive include: updated address information, purchase history, and additional demographic information.</p><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Web Cookies</p></h2><p>A “Web Cookie” is a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the site.</p><p>Company uses Web Cookies to track the pages that users visit during each Website session, both to help Company improve users’ experiences and to help Company understand how the Website is being used.</p><p>As with other Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website, Company analyzes and discloses in aggregated form information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to help Company, its partners and others better understand how the Website is being used.</p><p>Company does not attempt to link information gathered using Web Cookies to Personally-Identifying Information.</p><p>COMPANY USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES.</p><p>WEBSITE USERS WHO REFUSE WEB COOKIES ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.</p><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Third Party Advertisers</p></h2><p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Website.</p><p>These companies may use information (not including any Personally-Identifying Information) about your visits to this and other websites that are contained in Web Cookies in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p><p>Using a tool created by the Network Advertising Initiative, you can opt out of several third party ad servers’ and networks’ Web Cookies simultaneously.</p><p>If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please follow the following link: http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</p><p>Please contact us if you would like to know the identity of the third-party advertising companies we are currently using to serve ads.</p><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Web Beacons</p></h2><p>A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page that is usually invisible to the user and allows website operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page or an email.</p><p>Company may use Web Beacons on the Website and in emails to count users who have visited particular pages, viewed emails, and to deliver co-branded services.</p><p>Web Beacons are not used to access users’ Personally-Identifying Information; they are a technique Company may use to compile aggregated statistics about Website usage.</p><p>Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information including a Web Cookie number, time and date of a page or email view, and a description of the page or email on which the Web Beacon resides.</p><p>You may not decline Web Beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a Web Cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline Web Cookies on an individual basis.</p><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Aggregated and<br> Non-Personally-Identifying Information</p></h2><p>We may share aggregated and Non-Personally Identifying Information we collect under any of the above circumstances.</p><p>We may also share it with third parties and our affiliate companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Website and on websites of third parties.</p><p>We may combine Non-Personally Identifying Information we collect with additional Non-Personally Identifying Information collected from other sources.</p><p>We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.</p><p>For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our Website and the most popular features or services accessed.</p><p>This information does not contain any Personally-Identifying Information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.</p><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Collection, Use and Disclosure<br> of Personally-Identifying Information</p></h2><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Website Registration</p></h2><p>As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person.</p><p>Company collects a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and about Website users.</p><p>Much of the Personally-Identifying Information collected by Company about users is information provided by users themselves at the time they register to open an account or request information.</p><p>That information may include each user’s name, address, email address, and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information).</p><p>We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender, age, date of birth, username, hometown and other demographic information, and other relevant information as determined by Company from time to time.</p><p>Users of the Website are under no obligation to provide Company with Personally-Identifying Information of any kind, with the caveat that a user’s refusal to do so may prevent the user from using certain Website features.</p><p>BY REGISTERING WITH OR USING THE WEBSITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS “COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION” SECTION.</p><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Online Forums and Public Postings</p></h2><p>Certain Personally-Identifying Information collected from users is disclosed as a matter of course as a result of those users’ use of the Website.</p><p>We provide areas on our Website where you can post information. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use.</p><p>In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting.</p><p>Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others.</p><p>For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages.</p><p>We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.</p><p>USERS ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER HARM RESULTING FROM THEIR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.</p><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Company Communications</p></h2><p>We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by the Website that we think you may find valuable.</p><p>We may also send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service.</p><p>Generally, you may opt out of such emails, if applicable, at the time of registration or through your account settings, though we reserve the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.</p><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Company Disclosures</p></h2><p>Company will disclose Personally-Identifying Information under the following circumstances:</p><p><strong>By Law or to Protect Rights</strong>… When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our Company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements or policies, in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.</p><p><strong>Business Partners</strong>… When you make purchases or engage in promotions offered through our Website or our services, we may share Personally-Identifying Information with the businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes. When you elect to engage in a particular merchant’s offer or program, you authorize us to provide your email address and other information to that merchant.</p><p><strong>Affiliates</strong>… We may share some or all of your personal information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. Affiliates would include a parent company or any subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that is under common control with us.</p><p><strong>Third Party Service Providers</strong>… We may share your Personally-Identifying Information, which may include your name and contact information (including email address) with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our Website. We may also share your name, contact information and credit card information with our authorized service providers who process credit card payments. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purpose.</p><p><strong>Business Transfers or Bankruptcy</strong>… Company reserves the right to transfer all Personally-Identifying Information in its possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of Company’s assets. Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred Personally-Identifying Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if you are given notice of that new privacy policy and are given an opportunity to affirmatively opt-out of it. Personally-Identifying Information submitted or collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor organization.</p><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Changing Personally-Identifying Information<br> Account Termination</p></h2><p>You may at any time review or change your Personally-Identifying Information by going to your account settings (if available) or contacting us using the contact information below.</p><p>Upon your request, we will deactivate or delete your account and contact information from our active databases.</p><p>Such information will be deactivated or deleted as soon as practicable based on your account activity and accordance with our deactivation policy and applicable law.</p><p>To make this request, either go to your account settings (if available) or contact us as provided below.</p><p>We will retain in our files some personal information to prevent fraud, to troubleshoot problems, to assist with any investigations, to enforce our Terms of Use and to comply with legal requirements as is permitted by law.</p><p>Therefore, you should not expect that all your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. Additionally, we keep a history of changed information to investigate suspected fraud with your account.</p><h2><p style="text-align: center;">General Use</p></h2><p>We use the Personally-Identifiable Information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Website to: deliver the products and services that you have requested, manage your account and provide you with customer support, communicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us, our affiliate companies or other third parties, develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests on our Website and other sites, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, measure consumer interest in our services, reward you for the ads you watch, inform you of updates, customize your experience, detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity, enforce our Terms of Use, and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.</p><p>At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems.
