"The information on this site played a key part in helping me keep my sanity while dealing with puppy behavior! If you're like me and have a new puppy for the first time in your life, or if you've owned a dog for years, I highly recommend joining your site." <br>
<b>-- Dan Gallapoo, Dayton, Ohio</b>
<br><br>
"... He was able to perform as though he had been doing it all along..." <br><b>
-- Meg Sterns, Cell Phone: XXX-XXX-0504</b>
 <br><br>
"All the obnoxious behavior stopped..." <br><b>
-- Gene &amp; Rose Pedenko,
Marina Del Rey, California</b>

"... Just look at the attention I am getting from him. He won't take his eyes off of me!!!" <br><b>
-- Gwen Haynes, Canada</b>
 <br><br>
"My dog, Lex, is a large German Shepherd Dog. If I didn't switch to [your methods] when he was 6 months old, I would never have been able to take him on a proper walk. He was getting wild. He is now well behaved and a joyful pup. Thank you for your helpful tips. We greatly appreciate it." <b>-- Vita</b>
 <br><br>
"Thanks to you, I have the perfect Service Dog! Your matter of fact approach is both easy to understand and implement because you explain why a dog thinks the way that he does. Due to your training methods... Jasper has become not only a calm and wonderful companion but a well trained working dog. He can accompany me anywhere; Out to dinner, the mall, airports you name it... and we always get tons of compliments especially when they ask what program he came from and I explain he is owner trained! <br><br>
He is trained to assist me with balance and braces me as we walk, he also anticipates my gait weaknesses which is always changing due to my Multiple Sclerosis and he will adjust himself to meet my balance needs. 
He is also trained to help me get up from a sitting position or if I fall he will help me to stand, or get help for me if necessary. He loves to go get the mail or deliveries and bring them back to me with a single command, and our driveway is over 200 ft long! He has a totally reliable retrieve and can identify over 10 different objects by name. Most of this I attribute to your wonderful insight and advice through your website and newsletters.<br><br>
I am including a picture of Jasper and I at the Plaza Casino in Las Vegas from our last visit there. Thank you!"<br><b> -- Sheryl and Jasper "The Night Raider" SD, Riverside, Ca.</b>
 <br><br>
"This morning, Abby and I had one of those moments where you feel an indescribable inner connection, which followed with thoughts of how I nearly gave up on her last February. She's nearly one year old and still here. That's because of you, and I want to thank you. You've been the main influence in her training.<br><br>
 
My son took the attached picture. He was shocked that I allowed Abby on the couch. It's a rare thing, so don't slap my knuckles! I told him to take a picture because it would last longer." <br><b>-- Laurel, Salt Lake City, Utah.</b>
 <br><br>
"My name is Suzi Schaefers, owner of Suzi's Custom Dog Training in Morrison, CO. I've been a professional dog trainer for 19 years and have owned my own business for 8. I wouldn't want to do anything else, ever. I absolutely love what I do for a living.<br><br>
 
I am writing to you to let you know that I am happy to see that another dog trainer (people trainer) who uses virtually the exact same training methods and techniques that I do.... all are done by you the way they're done by myself.<br><br>
 
Here in CO there are dozens of dog trainers in the metro area, each with his or her own ideas on how a dog and its human should communicate. Only one, my mentor, trains dogs the way I do, the way you do. Short, sweet and to the point and with lots of positive reinforcement for a job well done.<br><br>
 
Just out of curiosity, I downloaded 'Secrets of a Professional Dog Trainer' many months ago and I felt like I was reading my own book!<br><br>
 
Thank you for your time, effort and dedication to our line of work. The world needs more dog trainers like us!"
<br><br>
Very sincerely,<br>

<b>-- Suzi Schaefers <br>

"Old, young, pit bull, mastiff, chihuahua, healthy or ill... they are loved here with my hubby and the 3 cats. And no fights, no running loose outside, no chewing of furniture. I know I train mainly with my heart, but I go by the same tenents you do: Understand their pack life and use it to your advantage. 
Love your site!" 
<b>-- Wendy and Tim Bartlett</b>
 <br><br>
We would like to speak with you about possibly being a guest on CBS Network ---talking about how to keep your dog from barking. If you are a dog whisperer we would like a live demo.
<br>
Thanks
