<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-12">
<p>Your privacy is important to us at the doggyloot website (the "Site"), which is
operated by doggyloot, Inc., a Illinois corporation (referred to as "us" or "we"). We
are committed to protecting your privacy online. Please read the following to learn
what information we collect from you (the "User" or the "End User") and how we use that
information. If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please email us at
<a href="mailto:woof@doggyloot.com">woof@doggyloot.com</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that by your accessing or using our site, you acknowledge that you have
read, understand, and agree to be bound to all the terms of this Privacy Policy and the
Terms of Service for the Site. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy or to the
Terms of Service, please do not use the Site.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Changes to Privacy Policy.</strong> We may change this Privacy Policy at
	any time by posting the revised Privacy Policy in the "Privacy Policy" section of the
	Site. The revised Privacy Policy is effective immediately when posted on the Site.
	Your continued use of the Site after the effectiveness of such revisions will
	constitute your acknowledgment and acceptance of the terms of the revised Privacy
	Policy.</li>

	<li>
		<strong>Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information.</strong>
		We collect two types of information about our Site Users: Personally Identifiable
		Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> Personally Identifiable
			Information is information that identifies you as a specific end user or customer
			of the Site. When you engage in certain activities on the Site, such as creating
			an account, ordering a product or service from us or our partners, submitting
			content and/or posting content in discussion forums, entering a contest or
			filling out a survey, sending us or our partners feedback, requesting information
			about our services, submitting an affiliate agreement (collectively, "Personal
			Activities"), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is
			optional for you to engage in a Personal Activity. If you elect to engage in a
			Personal Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal
			information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address
			(including zip code), email address, telephone number and date of birth. When you
			order products or services, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit
			card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information.
			Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is
			identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not
			provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you
			will not be permitted to engage in that activity. We use Personally Identifiable
			Information to provide products and services to you, administer sweepstakes and
			contests, enhance the operation of the Site, improve our marketing and
			promotional efforts, analyze Site use, improve our product and service offerings,
			and to tailor your experience with third parties as provided in Section 3 of this
			Privacy Policy. For example, if you send our customer service an email we may use
			your comments and feedback to tell others about our services, and may post your
			comment in our marketing materials or on our Site. In addition, if you use our
			Site to send information or a product to another person, we may store your
			personal information, and the personal information of any recipient. We may use
			that other person's contact information to allow him or her to view and accept
			your gift or to allow the recipient to access the information you requested we
			send. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to solve problems,
			resolve disputes, complete administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our
			agreements with you, including our Site Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy,
			comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement personnel.</li>

			<li><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> Non-Personally
			Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific End
			User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource
			Locator ("URL") or Internet Address of the Site you visited before coming to our
			Site, the URL of the Site you visit after leaving our Site, the type of browser
			you are using and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. We, and/or our
			authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically
			collect this information when you visit our Site through the use of electronic
			tools like Cookies, as described in Sections 4 and 8 of this Privacy Policy. We
			use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Site,
			analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and
			cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information
			with our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the
			overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
		<strong>Release of Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> We do not share
		your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as provided
		below:

		<ol>
			<li><strong>We may share your information with doggyloot Merchants and
			Vendors.</strong> From time to time, we provide offers from particular merchants
			(referred to as â€œdoggyloot Merchants and Vendors") who, as
			part of the offer, request information on doggyloot customers who purchased the
			offer. In those cases, we share some of your Personally Identifiable Information
			with doggyloot Merchants and Vendors. Sharing this Information will allow a
			doggyloot Merchant or Vendor to market directly to you should they choose to do
			so. However, we will only share Personally Identifiable Information with a
			doggyloot Merchant or Vendor if you engage in a Personal Activity, and then only
			to the doggyloot Merchant or Vendor involved in that Personal Activity. Please
			note that we will only provide a doggyloot Merchant or Vendor your information
			with an opt-in notice to you, in which you will have a chance to choose that
			doggyloot not give the doggyloot Merchant or Vendor your personal information. We
			specifically disclaim any responsibility or liability for the actions of such
			doggyloot Merchant or Vendor. While we inform them that they are only permitted
			to communicate with you for the purposes of the specific promotion with
			doggyloot, we do not have any responsibility for the actions of the doggyloot
			Merchant or Vendor, and the actions of the doggyloot Merchant or Vendor are not
			in our control.</li>

			<li><strong>We may share your information with Authorized Third Party Service
			Providers.</strong> We provide some of our services and products through third
			parties. These "Third Party Service Providers" perform functions on our behalf,
			like sending out and distributing our administrative and promotional emails. We
			may share your Personally Identifiable Information with such Service Providers to
			fulfill orders, deliver packages, send postal or email, administer contests or
			sweepstakes, remove repetitive information on customer lists, analyze data,
			provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, process credit
			card payments, operate the Site, troubleshoot, and provide customer service. We
			may also collect personal information from individuals and companies
			("Affiliates") with whom we have business relationships and may have to also
			share their information with Service Providers to accomplish our administrative
			tasks. For example, when you order a service, we release your credit card
			information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for the service and, if
			applicable, release your address to the delivery service to deliver the service.
			Likewise, we may release an Affiliate's information to our bank to send out a
			payment. We encourage doggyloot Merchants and Vendors and Third Party Service
			Providers to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally
			Identifiable Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of
			such parties and is not under our control.</li>

			<li><strong>We may share your information in a Business Transfer.</strong> As
			with any company, we could merge with, or be acquired by, another company. If
			this occurs, that company would acquire the information we maintain, including
			Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information
			would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.</li>

			<li><strong>We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection
			of Others.</strong> We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information when
			we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or a court order;
			enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Site Terms of Use or other agreements;
			or protect the rights, property or safety of the Site, its Users or others.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
		<strong>Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> We may
		disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Partners, Affiliates
		and Advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information
		(which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information) with "Third Party
		Advertisers" or "Third Party Advertising Companies" and other parties as provided
		below.

		<ol>
			<li><strong>We may use Third Party Advertising Companies to serve ads when you
			visit our Site.</strong> These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable
			Information about your visits to this and other Sites in order to provide,
			through the use of network tags, advertisements about goods and services that may
			be of interest to you.</li>

			<li><strong>We also use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze
			Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our
			Users to administer our Site and constantly improve its quality.</strong> We may
			also publish this information for promotional purposes or as a representative
			audience for Advertisers. Please note that this is not Personally Identifiable
			Information, only general summaries of the activities of our Users. Such data is
			collected on our behalf, and is owned and used by us.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li><strong>Updating and Correcting Information</strong> We believe that you should
	have the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable Information you
	provide us. You may change any of your Personally Identifiable Information either by
	logging into your account on the Site or by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:woof@doggyloot.com">woof@doggyloot.com</a> or writing to us at Doggyloot.com, 17 Barstow Road, Great Neck, NY 11021. Please indicate your name, address and email
	address, and what information you would like to update when you contact us. We
	encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it
	changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed;
	however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information
	associated with past transactions on the Site. In addition, in may be impossible for
	us to completely delete all of your information because we periodically backup
	information.</li>

	<li>
		<strong>User Choices on Collection and Use of Information.</strong> As previously
		stated, you can always choose not to provide information, although it may be
		required to engage in a certain activity on the Site.

		<p><strong>When you make purchases of our products and services, we will send you
		administrative and promotional emails.</strong> We will send you information
		regarding your account activity and purchases as well as updates about our products
		and promotional offers. You cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails.
		"Administrative Emails" relate to a User's activity on the Site, and include emails
		regarding a particular User's account, requests or inquiries, and purchases of
		products and services. You do have a choice with respect to promotional Emails.
		"Promotional Emails" advertise our products and services, including exclusive sales
		and other offers, and/or the products and services of our Advertisers and
		Affiliates. If you do not want to receive Promotional Emails from us, you may elect
		to opt-out of receiving Promotional Emails at any time after registering by
		e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:woof@doggyloot.com">woof@doggyloot.com</a>, by writing to
		us at Doggyloot.com, 17 Barstow Road, Great Neck, NY 11021, or by clicking the
		"unsubscribe" button at the bottom of any of our e-mails. When contacting us,
		please indicate your name, address, email address, and what Promotional Emails you
		do not want to receive.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<strong>Security of Information</strong>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>We take security seriously and take numerous precautions to protect
			the security of Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> You can access your
			Personally Identifiable Information on our Site through a password and your email
			address. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not share your
			password with anyone. In addition, your Personally Identifiable Information
			resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have
			access to. We use Transparent Redirect to ensure that your Personally
			Identifiable Information is safe as it is transmitted to us.</li>

			<li><strong>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless
			network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</strong> As a result, though we
			employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to
			partner with companies that do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any
			information transmitted to or from the Site, and are not responsible for the
			actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
		<strong>Data Tracking</strong>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Cookies.</strong> To facilitate and customize your experience with
			the Site, we store cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that
			is stored on a User's computer for record-keeping purposes which contains
			information about that User. We use cookies to save you time while using the
			Site, remind us who you are, and track and target User interests in order to
			provide a targeted experience. Cookies also allow us to collect Non-Personally
			Identifiable Information from you, like which pages you visited and what links
			you clicked on. Use of this information helps us to create a more user-friendly
			experience for all visitors. In addition, we may use Third Party Advertising
			Companies to display advertisements on our Site. As part of their service, they
			may place separate cookies on your computer. We have no access to or control over
			these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by our Site only and
			does not cover the use of cookies by any Advertiser. Most browsers automatically
			accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser settings to decline
			cookies. Please note that if you decline or delete these cookies, some parts of
			the Site may not work properly.</li>

			<li><strong>Other Tracking Devices.</strong> We may use other industry standard
			technologies like pixel tags and web beacons to track your use of our Site pages
			and promotions, or we may allow our Third Party Service Providers to use these
			devices on our behalf. Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed
			on certain pages on our Site, or in our emails that allow us to determine whether
			you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or
			click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate a Non-Personally Identifiable
			notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve our
			understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Site, as well as give us a
			way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and
			web beacons provided by our Affiliates and/or Marketing Partners for the same
			purposes.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
		<strong>Privacy Policies of Third Party Sites</strong>

		<p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we
		collect from you. Other Sites that may be accessible through this Site have their
		own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. If you link
		to any such Site, we urge you review the Site's privacy policy. We are not
		responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<strong>Miscellaneous Privacy Issues</strong>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Children.</strong> Minors under the age of 18 may not use the Site.
			We do not collect or maintain information from anyone known to be under the age
			of 18, and no part of the Site is designed to attract anyone under the age of 18.
			doggyloot does not sell products for purchase by children. In certain instances,
			we sell children's products for purchase by adults.</li>

			<li><strong>Public Areas.</strong> We may provide areas on our Site where you can
			publicly post information about yourself, can communicate with others, or can
			review products, restaurants, and submit media content. This information may be
			accessible by other consumers and companies and may appear on other Sites or web
			searches, and therefore this information could be read, collected, and used by
			others. For example, if you post your email address along with a review of one of
			our merchants or vendors you may receive unsolicited messages. We have no control
			over who reads your postings or what other users may do with the information you
			voluntarily post, so please use caution when posting any personal
			information.</li>

			<li><strong>Notice of Privacy Rights to California Residents.</strong> California
			law requires that we provide you with a summary of your privacy rights under the
			California Online Privacy Protection Act (the "Act") and the California Business
			and Professions Code. As required by the Act, we have provided you with the
			categories of Personally Identifiable Information that we collect through the
			Site and the categories of third party persons or entities with whom such
			Personally Identifiable Information may be shared for direct marketing purposes
			at your request. California law requires us to inform you, at your request, (1)
			the categories of Personally Identifiable Information we collect and what third
			parties we share that information with; (2) the names and addresses of those
			third parties; and (3) examples of the products marketed by those companies. The
