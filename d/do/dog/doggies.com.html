     <p>Doggies.com is an internet website where people can share information about their dogs, including pictures and videos, with other dog owners, guardians and lovers. All subscribers, visitors and participants in or to doggies.com are covered by our Ironclad Privacy Policy.</p>
     <p><strong>What information do we collect from you?</strong></p>
     <p>When you register to participate in doggies.com and at other times, we collect your name, email address and zip or postal code. If you register your dog, we collect information about your dog including its name, age, breed, gender, activities, etc.</p>

     <p><strong>How do we use the information we collect from you?</strong></p>
     <p>We will never sell, rent, barter or otherwise share your name, email address or other personal identifying information to any outside party.</p>
     <p>We may use information in the following ways:<br>
       For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information including, for example, to enable us to process, validate and verify subscriptions.<br>
       To send you e-mail notifications about our new or existing products and services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you.<br>
       To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and services.<br>

     <p>We may use third party network advertisers to deliver ads to you on our behalf. These network advertisers and service providers may be supplied with or have access to your personally identifiable information solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf.</p>
     <p>Except as specifically set forth in this Ironclad Privacy Policy, we will not share your personally identifiable information outside of doggies.com and its affiliates unless you specifically agree to having your personally identifiable information shared with a company that is not affiliated with us.</p>
     <p>We will use information you enter about your dog only to display it on the web site or on our affiliated web site, breeders.net; it will never be sold, rented, bartered or otherwise shared to any outside party. Since the website is accessible by anyone with an internet connection and a web browser, any information, pictures and videos you post can be copied by any other internet user. Although we discourage abusive copying, the opportunity for it is an inherent part of the internet. You should never give us information, pictures or videos that you do not now or ever want someone else to have access to.</p>

     <p>You may at anytime edit any information or remove your dog and personal accounts entirely. We require only that you provide and maintain a valid and current email address while you have an account so we may contact you.</p>
     <p>We reserve the right to transfer your submitted information in the event of a transfer of ownership of doggies.com, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, we will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
