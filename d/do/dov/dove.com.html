<br><b><font size="+1">Unilever United States, Inc. Privacy Policy</font></b>
<p>The web site you have entered is operated by or on behalf of a subsidiary
of Unilever United States, Inc., which is a member of the Unilever group
of companies ("Unilever").&nbsp;
</p><p>Unilever is committed to protecting your personal privacy. This Privacy
Policy outlines the type of information that is collected by Unilever on
this web site, and how we use and protect it. This Policy also tells you
what to do if you do not want your Personal Information collected when
you visit our web site, and how you can change information you have already
provided to us.&nbsp; This Policy applies only to the Unilever web sites
listed <a href="#sites">here</a>.&nbsp; For example, it does not apply
to banners, sweepstakes and other advertisements or promotions we may sponsor
or participate in on web sites owned by third parties.
</p><p>For specific information regarding the privacy of children who visit
our sites, click <a href="#children">here</a>.
</p><p><b>Your Consent to This Privacy Policy</b>
</p><p>By using our web site, you signify that you agree with the terms of
our current Privacy Policy as posted in this area of the site. If you do
not agree with any term in this Policy, please do provide any Personal
Information (defined below) on this site.
</p><p>If you choose not to provide Personal Information on this site, you may
not be able to do certain things, like access particular areas of the site,
enter a sweepstakes or contest, request samples, or send us e-mail.
</p><p><b>Collection of Personal Information</b>
</p><p>As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means personally
identifiable information such as your name, street address, telephone number,
credit card information, screen name and email address.&nbsp; The site
you entered may collect some or all of these types of Personal Information.&nbsp;
Please be assured that Unilever will not collect any Personal Information
from your visits to our sites unless you provide this information voluntarily.
</p><p>When you provide us with Personal Information, you are authorizing us
to use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy,
which includes your right to limit our use of the Personal Information
as described in this Policy (see "Who to Contact" below).
</p><p>The site you entered may also collect Personal Information from you
about a third party (e.g., the site might allow you to send an electronic
"post card" to a friend, in which case we will need that person's name
and e-mail address).&nbsp; Please note that we use such information only
for the specified purpose (e.g., to mail the post card) and we will not
contact the third party again by e-mail unless and until the third party
contacts us.
</p><p><b>How We Use Your Information</b>
</p><p>When you supply Personal Information at this web site, the brand whose
site you entered will use it for the express purpose for which it was collected
(e.g., to enter you in a sweepstakes or to send you a sample).&nbsp; It
may also be used by the brand whose site you entered, as well as by our
other brands,&nbsp; to contact you regarding other products and services
which may be of interest to you (including those we may offer jointly with
other companies).&nbsp; (For more information on Unilever and its brands,
see the paragraph about Unilever at the end of this Policy.)&nbsp; At any
time, however, you may opt out of such future contact. (See "Who to Contact"
below.)
</p><p>At times we may retain third parties to analyze data we collect on our
web sites, including Personal Information, solely to help us improve our
products and our web sites.&nbsp; In addition, if you order a product or
service from us, we may share Personal Information with suppliers and other
third parties to allow delivery of such product or service.&nbsp; These
suppliers and other third parties are not authorized by us to use your
Personal Information in any other way.&nbsp;
</p><p>Finally, please note that we will release your Personal Information
if required to do so by law, or by search warrant, subpoena or court order.&nbsp;
</p><p><a name="cookie"></a><b>Other Information We May Collect</b>
</p><p>You may have heard of "cookies," which are files or pieces of information
that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive.&nbsp; Unilever
may use cookies to collect other information during your visit to our web
site, such as the particular site areas you visit and the products or services
you buy through our web site. We collect this information to better tailor
our site and our products to your interests and needs. Cookies may also
be used to help speed up your future activities at our site; the computer
can remember that you have already provided Personal Information to us
and not request that you provide any a second time.&nbsp;
</p><p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer,
you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being
sent.&nbsp; Refusal of cookies at the site you entered may result in an
inability to visit certain areas of the site or to receive personalized
information when you visit the site.
</p><p>In addition, we are constantly trying to improve how we promote our
web sites. To help us do this, we may measure the effectiveness of our
web presence by determining what you clicked on to get to our site.
</p><p>Information about your computer, such as your IP address (a number assigned
to your computer whenever you surf the Internet), the type of Internet
browser you are using and the type of computer operating system you are
using may also be collected and linked to your Personal Information.&nbsp;
This is to ensure that our web sites present the best web experience for
visitors, and that they are an effective information resource.&nbsp;
</p><p>Finally, we may supplement the information that you provided us with
other information that we receive from third parties.&nbsp; We do this
for marketing purposes in order to provide more targeted products and service
to meet your needs.
</p><p><a name="children"></a><b>Children</b>
</p><p>Unilever is committed to protecting the online privacy of children and
making the Internet safe for our users. For this reason, Unilever sites

their children's use of e-mail and other activities on line
</p><p><b>Security of Information</b>
</p><p>We take reasonable precautions to keep your Personal Information secure.&nbsp;
All personally identifiable information is subject to restricted access
to prevent unauthorized access, modification or misuse.&nbsp;
