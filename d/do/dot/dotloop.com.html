            <p><strong>Our Commitment To Privacy</strong><br>
Your privacy is important to us. In order to better protect your privacy, we provide this notice (the “Policy”) explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. By providing personal information to The dotloop Company (“dotloop”) through our website www.dotloop.com, you agree and consent that we may collect, use, and disclose your personal information in accordance with this Policy. To make this Policy easy to find, we make it available on our homepage.</p>
<p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong><br>
This Policy applies to all information collected or submitted on dotloop.com. We consider “personal information” to mean information about an identifiable individual. The type of personal information collected on the website includes, but is not limited to: Name, Address, Email Address, Phone Number, and information about a real esate transaction in which you are involved. Contact information of other people may also be collected from or submitted by you during the transaction process or for other communication purposes. The same types of information previously described in this paragraph will also apply to other people’s information. All credit card information submitted by you within dotloop.com in connection with a transaction is collected by a secure third party and is not stored by dotloop.</p>
<p><strong>The Way We Use Information</strong><br>
We use the information you provide when processing or completing a transaction on dotloop to communicate to the other parties involved. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete a transaction, where required or permitted by law, or as set forth in this Policy. We may share your personal information with third parties who may offer services that may be of interest (“Third Party Sharing”).</p>
<p>Similarly, we use the information you provide about someone else for communications required during the transaction process. If you provide personal information about your client(s) to us for the purpose of completing a transaction, you represent and warrant that you have obtained their consent to do so. Such information may be shared with outside parties to complete a transaction for Third Party Sharing.</p>
<p>If you wish to opt out of such Third Party Sharing, please email us with your request at support@dotloop.com. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. DotLoop may use the information collected from you to provide you with additional information about dotloop’s services, partners, promotions, and events. Every marketing email from DotLoop contains instructions on how to opt out of receiving further marketing emails.</p>
<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where DotLoop.com is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our website to better suit our customers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form.</p>
<p>At times DotLoop.com may make certain non-identifying information available to strategic partners that work with DotLoop.com to provide products and services.  Such information helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests and needs.</p>
<p>We may also share personal information in response to a valid court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful. We may share certain Personal Information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property and safety of others and ourselves.  In the event that we enter into a business transaction, such as a merger with or an acquisition by another company, or a sale of some or all of our assets, your personal information may be among the assets that are transferred or disclosed in connection with such a transaction.</p>
<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described in this Policy without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
<p><strong>Our Commitment To Data Security</strong><br>
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure the information we collect online. You should note, though, that the internet is not a 100% secure environment. There is no guarantee that information you provide or that we maintain may not be accessed, copied, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>

You can retrieve your Personal Information by accessing your account on dotloop.com.</p>
<p><strong>For Residents of Canada</strong><br>

Such circumstances include where dotloop is required or permitted by law; where it is necessary to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of an identifiable person or group; or where the information is public. dotloop will not disclose more information than required or permitted.</p>
<p>dotloop endeavors to ensure that your personal information is as accurate as necessary and generally retains personal information as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.</p>
