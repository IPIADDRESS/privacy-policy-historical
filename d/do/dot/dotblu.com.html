        <b>User Provided Information:</b> You
        provide certain personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address and phone number) to TownHog when choosing to participate in various

        or sweepstakes, taking advantage of promotions, responding to surveys,
        or subscribing to newsletters or other mailing lists.
        
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Cookies Information:</b> When you
        visit the Dotblu Sites, we may send one or more cookies - a small text
        file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer
        that uniquely identifies your browser. TownHog uses both session cookies
        and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close
        your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on
        subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by
        following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is

        your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is
        being sent. However, some features of the Dotblu Sites may not function
        properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

        <b>Log File Information:</b> When you
        use the Dotblu Sites, our servers automatically record certain
        information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website.
        These server logs may include information such as your web request,
        Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language,
        referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks,
        domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages,
        the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your
        request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your
        browser.
        
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Clear GIFs Information/JavaScript:</b>
        When you use the Dotblu Sites, we may employ "clear GIFs" (AKA Web

        If you submit personally identifiable
        information to us through the Dotblu Sites, then we use your personal

        functionality of the Dotblu Sites.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Any personal information or content that you
        voluntarily disclose online becomes publicly available and can be
        collected and used by others. Any files that you share with friends may
        be redistributed by them through the Internet and other media channels,
        and may be viewed by the general public.
        
        <br><br>
        
        We do not use your email address or other
        personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing
        messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program
        or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We
        may, however, use your email address without further consent for
        nonmarketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Dotblu Site changes, TownHogs that need to be settled, TownHogs that
        settle that you have been playing, monthly newsletters, comments on
        your profile, messages sent to you from TownHog, and for customer
        service purposes).
        
        <br><br>
        
        We use both your personally identifiable
        information and certain nonpersonally identifiable information (such as
        anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type,
        clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Dotblu
        Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and
        services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and
        trends.
        
        <br><br>
        
        We use cookies, clear GIFs, and log file
        information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to
        re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the dotblu
        Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c)
        monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor
        aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.;
        and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions,
        sweepstakes, and contests.

        We do share nonpersonally identifiable

        parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain
        content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on

        <div class="footerPage_header">Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</div>
        <p>Dotblu allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad
        networks, to serve advertisements within the Dotblu Sites. These
        third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly
        to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Dotblu
        Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens.
        They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or
        Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and
        to personalize the advertising content you see.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>Dotblu does not provide any personally identifiable information to
        these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or
        except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have
        the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an
        advertiser asks Dotblu to show an advertisement to a certain audience
        (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men
        ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond
        to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that
        you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The
        advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Dotblu
        Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any
        personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver
        to you.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these
        third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more
        information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out
        of certain practices. Dotblu's privacy policy does not apply to, and we
        cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>Currently, Dotblu has relationships with the following third-party ad servers or ad networks:</p>

        <p>Dotblu uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and
        technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your
        personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the
        security of any information you transmit to Dotblu and you do so at
        your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Dotblu
        makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our
        systems. However, please note this is not a guarantee that such

        <br>
        
        <p>If Dotblu learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt

        security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a
        legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To

        <p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.
        For that reason, Dotblu does not knowingly collect or maintain
        personally identifiable information or nonpersonally identifiable
        information on the Dotblu Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and
        no part of our website is directed to persons under 13. If you are
        under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Dotblu
        Sites at any time or in any manner. If Dotblu learns that personally
        identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been
        collected on the Dotblu Sites without verified parental consent, then Dotblu will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.</p>
