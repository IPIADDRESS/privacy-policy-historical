				<h1>Do Tell All Privacy Policy</h1><p><span>Last Updated February 2011</span></p><p>Do Tell All ("Do Tell All," "we," "us" or "our") understands               the importance of maintaining your privacy, and we therefore               strive to provide our services with your protection in mind. This               Privacy Policy applies to your use of Do Tell All's service               (the "Service") that provides users, who submit search queries in               a Do Tell All or third-party branded search box on a Web page               (a "Search Page"), with Internet navigation assistance web pages               containing relevant local search results and other content               ("Results Pages;" and, together with any Search Pages, the               "Do Tell All Web Pages"). This Privacy Policy describes our               practices regarding the collection, maintenance, use and sharing               of information from the Service. This Privacy Policy is               maintained in conformity with any and all applicable               privacy-related laws and regulations. Our Privacy Policy may               change from time to time, and those changes will be available for               your review on most Do Tell All Web Pages that you view and on               our web page located at www.Do Tell All/privacy.php. Your               continued use of our Service after any such changes have been               made will signify your assent to the changed Privacy Policy.               Accordingly, we ask that you bookmark and periodically review               this Privacy Policy to ensure continuing familiarity with the               most current version.</p><h4>1. INFORMATION WE GATHER</h4><p>We do not               collect any personally identifiable information about you (such               as your name, physical address, email address, or telephone               number) when you use our Service. If you wish to submit an online               request for information about partnering with Do Tell All or               any other information about our Service or our company, you will               be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information,               including your name, company, e-mail address, and telephone               number. We will always let you know whether such information is               required or optional. Do Tell All Web Pages will transmit               limited non-personally identifiable information that your browser               makes available whenever you visit a web site. This log               information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser               type, browser language, operating system, the domain name of the               web site from which you linked to our Service, search queries               entered by you on our Service, and the date and time of your               queries. Please note that any search query information collected               by us is maintained by Do Tell All on an aggregated basis               (i.e., together with the queries of all of our end-users) for the               purposes of generating statistics regarding the use of our               Service (such as the number of queries performed by the average               end-user per month, a list of the most popular query terms,               etc.), and is never used in a manner that matches specific search               query information with the identity of any particular end-user.               In order to take advantage of certain features on the Service               (including the posting of reviews of businesses and the receipt               of newsletters and special offers from Do Tell All), you may be               required to create an online account with Do Tell All. During               the account creation process, you will be required to provide               certain personal information such as your e-mail address. We may               also request other information such as your zip code, age range,               gender, and whether you want to receive promotional information               from Do Tell All. We will store all of this information. If you               have an online account with us, you have the ability to review               and update your personal information online by clicking on a "My               Account" link (or similar link) on the Service and logging into               your account. You can also review and update your personal               information by contacting us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>2. UNSUBSCRIBE</h4><p>If at any time you wish to unsubscribe from Do Tell All emails or opt out of future notifications please submit your email address to www.DoTellAll.com/unsubscribe.</p><h4>3. COOKIES AND WEB               BEACONS</h4><p>When you visit               a Do Tell All Search Page, a cookie that uniquely identifies               your browser may be sent to your computer. A "cookie" is a small               file containing your preferences that is sent to your browser and               sent back by your browser each time your browser accesses our               servers. Cookies that we may use may only be read by the server               that placed them there. We use cookies to improve the quality of               our Service (for example, by fulfilling your language, filtering,               and other preferences) and to better understand how people               interact with our Service (for example, by tracking user trends               and patterns of how people search). Most browsers are initially               set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse               all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. If you               wish to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your               browser, you should refer to the documentation accompanying your               browser. However, some aspects of the Do Tell All Service may               not function properly without cookies. Most, if not all, of the               advertisements appearing on the Service are delivered to you by               one of our Web advertising partners ("Ad Serving Partners"). In               the course of delivering such advertisements, our Ad Serving               Partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.               Thereafter, information about your visits to the Service, such as               your search terms or phrases or the number of times you have               viewed an advertisement (but not your name, address, or other               personal information), is used to deliver advertisements to you.               The information collected by our Ad Serving Partners through               cookies is anonymous, and our Ad Serving Partners are not               authorized to collect any personally identifiable information               about you. For more information about cookies, and how to               "opt-out" of cookies from certain Ad Serving Partners, please               click here.</p><h4>4. HOW WE USE THE               INFORMATION WE GATHER</h4><p>Most of the               limited, non-personally identifiable information collected is               used to operate, develop, and improve our products and services.               For example, Do Tell All may use your IP address to determine               which language to use to provide you with Internet search results               or to advise you how far a particular vendor is from your               location. In addition, information collected from end-users may               be used in aggregate form to, among other things, determine the               total number of end-users who are using our Service, prepare               utilization reports for our partners or affiliates (collectively,               "Partners"), diagnose and fix compatibility problems or other               problems with our Service, and perform statistical analyses to               enable us to build higher quality, more useful online services.               The information collected from end-users also allows us to               deliver search results pages that are as responsive as possible               to an individual end-user's particular search query (for example,               serving results in the end-user's native language and tailored to               the end-user's country of connectivity). If you submit a request               for information about Do Tell All through our web site, we may               use your e-mail address to send you an e-mail that gives you the               opportunity to elect to receive periodic e-mail alerts from               Do Tell All regarding developments at the company. In addition,               if you elect to receive promotional information from               Do Tell All when you create an online account, we will use the               information you provided to Do Tell All during the account               creation process to send you only promotions that will be most               relevant to you. We also take appropriate security measures to               protect against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized               alteration, disclosure or destruction of, data.</p><h4>5. WHEN WE DISCLOSE               THE INFORMATION WE GATHER</h4><p>As a general               rule, we do not share the information we collect from end-users               with third-parties. However, when users submit a search query on               our Service, IP addresses and search terms or phrases are               transmitted to certain Partners with whom Do Tell All has               subcontracted, so that those Partners can deliver responsive               Internet search results, advertising, or other services and, in               some cases, for the internal data reporting purposes of those               Partners. In addition, some of the information we collect is               provided, in aggregate form only, to our Partners solely for               purposes of calculating amounts owed to such Partners or helping               such Partners improve their services. Our Partners are obligated               by applicable law to protect the privacy of certain types of               data; however, we are not responsible for their actions or               omissions, including the manner in which they use information               that they receive from us. Nevertheless, if you feel that any of               our Partners, or any third party who claims association with               Do Tell All, is improperly collecting or using information               about you, we urge you to contact them directly and also to               inform us by e-mailing us at privacy@dotellall.com. If in the               future we sell or transfer assets or portions of our business, or               if we experience a change in control, reorganization or               liquidation, we may transfer such information to our successor or               buyer, subject to this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to               share aggregated information with others. Examples of this               include the number of users who searched for "used cars" or how               many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Finally, we               reserve the right to disclose any information about you if it is               required by law, necessary to defend our legal rights, or if we               in good faith believe it is appropriate to cooperate in               investigations of fraud or other illegal activity in which you               may be involved (or are reasonably suspected to be involved),               even without a subpoena, warrant or court order.</p><h4>6. USER               REVIEWS</h4><p>If you have an               account with Do Tell All, you can post reviews of businesses to               the Service, which we then store. Such postings are governed by               our [Terms of Service]. The postings may appear on other               third-party websites or when searches are executed on the subject               of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal               information in a review, that information will be publicly               available and can be collected and used by others. For example,               if you post your email address in a review, you may receive               unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your review or               what other users may do with the information you voluntarily               provide in the review, so we encourage you to exercise discretion               and caution with respect to your personal information. We may               sell your reviews to third-parties.</p><h4>7. NO RESPONSIBILITY               FOR THIRD-PARTY PRACTICES</h4><p>Certain of our               Partners who provide or enable any functionality on the Service               may also collect information from you. We are not responsible for               the privacy practices of our Partners. In addition, any web sites               that you click to from one of our Results Pages may have been               developed by third-parties over which we exercise no control.               Such web sites may send their own cookies to end-users, collect               data, or solicit personally identifiable information from you. We               are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of               such web sites, including such web sites' use of any information               collected when our end-users click through to such web sites.               Even though such information might not identify you personally,               we strongly encourage you to become familiar with the privacy               practices of those web sites.</p><h4>8. PROVISIONS               APPLICABLE TO ADVERTISERS ONLY</h4><p>Any advertiser               who wishes to place advertising on our Service will be asked to               provide certain information such as the advertiser's business               name, phone number, physical address, e-mail address, service               area, website URL, description of the advertiser's business, a               contact name, advertising category and/or keyword, and credit               card information. Some of this information is personally               identifiable. This information will be used by Do Tell All to               create an account for the advertiser, improve the Service,               communicate changes to the Service, conduct research, provide               anonymous reporting for internal purposes and for reporting to               third-parties, and market Do Tell All products and services to               advertisers. Some of the information will also be displayed               within the advertiser's ad copy on the Service. We will not               disclose any personally identifiable information to third parties               without your prior consent. Advertisers may edit their account               information by contacting Do Tell All's Client Services               Department at advertising@dotellall.com.</p>			</div>
