There you will be given the opportunity to opt out of receiving promotional emails from us and to separately opt out of receiving promotional emails from certain third parties, or from us on their behalf, whom dotPhoto believes offers quality goods or services that may interest our users.  If you have opted out of receiving promotional emails, you may use the MyAccount section to choose to begin receiving promotional emails full of great offers from dotPhoto and/or great offers relating to quality goods and services from third parties.  "Promotional emails" are emails that are sent solely for promotional purposes.

It is our policy to send only a reasonable number of promotional emails to our users.   Please note that if you ask not to receive promotional emails from dotPhoto, you may still receive promotional emails during the next 72-hour period (as it may take some time for your preferences to be updated throughout our computer systems) and you may still receive non-promotional emails from dotPhoto.<br><br>
