It is our policy to send only a reasonable number of promotional emails to our users.   Please note that if you ask not to receive promotional emails from dotPhoto, you may still receive promotional emails during the next 72-hour period (as it may take some time for your preferences to be updated throughout our computer systems) and you may still receive non-promotional emails from dotPhoto.<br><br>
