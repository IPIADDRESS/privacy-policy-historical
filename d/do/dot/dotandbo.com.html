<h2>Why Do We Collect Personal Information?</h2>
<p>Dot &amp; Bo offers various products and services to our Customers and also strives to meet the needs of our
Customers. We use your Personal Information for internal purposes such as tracking your order, analyzing your
preferences, and noting trends and statistics. To do this effectively, we need to collect certain Personal
Information.</p>
<h2>The Personal Information We Collect From You</h2>
<p>All Personal Information we collect from you requires your consent, for example, opening an account, purchase
and delivery of products, special offers, etc. We may request your consent from time to time to take part in improved
product performance or for marketing purposes that we think will be useful to you. However, unless you are informed
otherwise, the Personal Information we hold is for establishing and managing our business and customer relationship
with you. Sensitive information is subject to greater restrictions and governed by law.</p>
<p>By communicating with Dot &amp; Bo, including by email and by completing online forms, you are giving your
consent to the collection of what Personal Information you provide.</p>
<p>You have the right to anonymity and do not have to supply us with information. However, if you choose not to
provide the information and we need to fulfill your request for a specific product, we may be unable to provide you
with that requested product.</p>
<h2>Keeping a Record of Personal Information</h2>
<p>Depending on the product you have acquired, it may be necessary to keep a record of the transaction for business
purposes or to enable us to respond to your concerns.</p>
<p>We may hold Personal Information for the following purposes:
</p><ul>
<li>Internal accounting and administration;</li>
<li>To supply you with information about your account including regular statements;</li>

<li>To administer sales records;</li>
<li>To provide information about us, our products, services and special offers; and</li>

</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Occasionally we require organizations outside Dot &amp; Bo to provide a service for purposes, which are
necessary for us to conduct our business, functions and activities (for example advertising names of competition
winners and delivering products). We take all steps to ensure these organizations both inside and outside of the
United States deal with Personal Information according to this Policy.</p>
<h2>Our Disclosure of Your Information/Security</h2>

regulatory purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
