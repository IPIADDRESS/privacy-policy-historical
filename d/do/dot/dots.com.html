<h1>How Does Dots.com Protect Children's Privacy?</h1>

<p>We at Dots.com are concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly collect, use, and/or disclose personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior parental consent.</p>

<p>Children under the age of 13 who desire to register for our e-mail updates and sweepstakes are required to have their parent or legal guardian complete and mail in the consent form. We will discard any e-mail registration that is not accompanied by a parental consent form.</p>

<p>Dots.com does not collect or store information in messages that children or others send by e-Dot cards.</p>

<p>Dots.com does not condition a child's participation in any online activity or the collection of more personally identifiable information than necessary for that activity.</p>

<p>Upon request, a child's parent or legal guardian can review and have deleted the information that we have collected and ask that we stop collecting it in the future. A parent or legal guardian of a child under the age of 13 has the right to find out what personally identifiable information that we have about the child. A parent or legal guardian may contact us at 1-877-874-2674 during regular business hours.</p>

<p>If we change our Privacy Policy with respect to children, we will seek to obtain parental consent before using any previously collected personal information in the new manner.</p>
