      are concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet. Consistent 
      with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never 
      knowingly collect, use, and/or disclose personal information from anyone 
      under the age of 13 without prior parental consent. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dots.com collects 
        the personal information from children at our e-mail registration and 
        sweepstakes consent form: name, e-mail address, physical address, telephone 
        number, date of birth, and fashion and event preferences. We may use this 
        information from children in order to conduct our sweepstakes and for 
        marketing purposes. We may also share this information with outside vendors 
        and other organizations that provide support services to us in relation 
        to customer orders or that help us with our marketing programs. Except 
        as just discussed, Dots.com does not sell or trade the personal information 
        of children under 13 to others.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Upon request, a child's 
        parent or legal guardian can review and have deleted the information that 
        we have collected and ask that we stop collecting it in the future. A 
        parent or legal guardian of a child under the age of 13 has the right 
        to find out what personally identifiable information that we have about 
        the child. A parent or legal guardian may contact us at <b>1-877-874-2674
