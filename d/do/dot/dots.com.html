      at Dots.com are concerned about the safety of children when they use the 
      Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 
      1998, we will never knowingly collect, use, and/or disclose personal information

        information from children in order to conduct our sweepstakes and for 
        marketing purposes. We may also share this information with outside vendors 
        and other organizations that provide support services to us in relation 
        to customer orders or that help us with our marketing programs. Except 
        as just discussed, Dots.com does not sell or trade the personal information
