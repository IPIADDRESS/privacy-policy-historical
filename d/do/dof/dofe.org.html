   <h3>DofE online services privacy policy</h3>
</div><div class="cms-text"><p>The Duke of Edinburgh's Award is committed to protecting the privacy of its participants, Leaders and supporters and the users of our online services. This statement explains how we achieve that goal and gives details of our privacy practices, including what information we collect about people using <i>e</i>DofE, our website and other online services, how the information will be used or disclosed, and rights with respect to our collection and use of personal data.</p>
<p>The DofE ensures all its work is carried out in accordance with the Data Protection Act (1998), our registration number is Z6551949.</p>
<p>By using our online services <b>you are accepting</b> the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Why do we collect personal information?</h4>
<p>There are two types of information you provide us with when using our online services: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us and information collected by us as you interact with our services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We collect your personal information because it helps us support Licensed Organisations, DofE centres and groups and participants in achieving an Award. It enables us to give convenient access to our online services and support mechanisms. In addition, personal information helps us to continue to develop and improve the way the DofE operates and supports its network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What information does the DofE collect and why?</h4>
<p>We may ask you to provide us with personal information on a voluntary basis in certain areas of our online services. In particular, you may be asked to provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b><i>e</i>DofE:</b> If you wish to use the online management system offered by the DofE called <i>e</i>DofE you will need to provide personal information including, but not limited to, personal details, contact details, demographic information and, for young people, detailed information about your DofE programme and activities. This convenient service saves you time and allows for easier use of our services. If you are using <i>e</i>DofE, you will be set up on the system with a default username and password by the person at the next level up within the DofE structure. On your first login you will create a personal profile by choosing a personal username and password (with a password hint in case you forget it) and providing your personal details. The system saves your information. The next time you access <i>e</i>DofE all you need to do is enter your username and password and the system looks up the information it needs to assist you. We keep records of your activity on <i>e</i>DofE to help us understand how you use the system so that we can make it a more effective tool for you.</li>
    <li><b>Subscription information:</b> If you want to subscribe to the DofE magazine or other publications, including e-newsletters, and you are not using <i>e</i>DofE, you will be asked to provide general information, including contact details (such as your name and address) and details of your involvement with the DofE. We will use this information to maintain your subscription account with us and to fulfil your subscription(s).</li>
    <li><b>Survey information: </b>If you want to participate in any of our online surveys you may be asked to provide personal information. The nature of the information may vary depending upon the type of survey that is being conducted, but is likely to include contact information and demographic information. We will use this information to determine which products and services are likely to be of interest to you and to improve our service to you.</li>
    <li><b>Competition information:</b> If you want to enter any of our competitions online you may be asked to provide personal information. The nature of the information may vary depending on the competition, but is likely to include contact information. We will use this information to inform our competition winners. We may publicise the winners, but will not give enough information to personally identify you to anyone else without explicit permission.</li>
    <li><b>Applications for financial support: </b>The DofE provides access to several funds for participants including the SERCO Bursary and the ALDO Trust. The nature of the information we will ask for in the application process may vary depending upon the application process and requirements of the funds, but is likely to include general personal information, including contact details (such as your name and address) demographic information and information about your DofE activities. We may publicise participants who are granted support, but we will ask your permission before doing so.</li>
    <li>If you are unhappy with your experience with any part of the DofE or wish to provide feedback on our services or programmes you may do so using our <a title="Enquiries page" href="/en/content/cms/Enquiries/Enquiries.aspx">Complaints, Feedback and Enquiries system found on the DofE website</a>.&nbsp; You will be asked to provide contact information and details of the incident.&nbsp; You will need to authorise us to share this information in order to take action on your feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How does The Duke of Edinburgh's Award use information that it collects from its online services?</h4>
<p>All contact from the DofE using personal data will communicate useful and relevant information to either help participants complete a DofE programme, Leaders/OAs to run DofE programmes more effectively or help the DofE Charity improve the quality and breadth of its programmes.</p>
<p>We may therefore use this information about you for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To send you information about and changes to <i>e</i>DofE and the DofE website.</li>
    <li>To send you information about the DofE and promotional material about our products and services and products and services offered by&nbsp;our partner organisations and companies&nbsp;that we think may be of interest to you, provided that you have opted in as described below.</li>
    <li>
    <div>To monitor consumer interest in our range of products and services and to assist us in tailoring the content of the website and <em>e</em>DofE to our online visitors' needs by collecting information about your preferences through tracking patterns of page-viewing, downloads and uploads.&nbsp;</div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <div>To create a profile relating to you in order to show you the content that we think you might be interested in and to display the content according to your preferences.</div>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Does The Duke of Edinburgh's Award disclose information that it collects from these sites to other parties?</h4>
<div>
<div style="margin-left: 0cm">The DofE will not provide any information collected from the DofE website or eDofE that personally identifies you to any other company or organisation, unless it is required to do so by law, Court Order by other Government or law enforcement authorities or as described in this policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>Data collected on eDofE is shared with the relevant Licensed Organisations and DofE centre, as a necessity to enable young people to complete their DofE programme and achieve an Award and for DofE Leaders to be managed effectively.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The DofE has partnered with leading supplier DG3 to enable participants to create an Achievement Pack on approval of an Award, using a secure online environment.</div>
<div>To create this, the DofE will share information stored in the eDofE database that is necessary for DG3 to provide these services. &nbsp;The information that is exchanged contains personal data such as eDofE user ID, name, email and date of birth along with eDofE approved evidence. &nbsp;A valid email address must be supplied to create an Achievement Pack.&nbsp;</div>
<div>DG3 will not share this information with third parties, except for the purposes of fulfilling an order (i.e. postal and payment services). &nbsp;DG3 are not allowed to use any personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing the Achievement Pack publishing service.</div>
<div>Participants will be notified of this before any data is exchanged and asked to agree to the terms and conditions of DG3’s privacy policy before they can access the secure site.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Duke of Edinburgh's Award uses third parties to process and/or store data that are received on the website and eDofE but these third parties have no rights to use any information that personally identifies you for any other purpose.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please bear in mind that if a partner asks the DofE to show an advertisement to certain participants (for example, men aged 18-24) or participant segment (for example, Bronze Physical section participants), which includes yourself and you respond to that advertisement, the partner may conclude that this segment fits the description of the audience they are trying to reach and therefore continues to request advertisements are shown to them.</div>
<div>The partner may also use information regarding your use of the DofE’s online services, such as the number of times adverts have been viewed by segment/type of person (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which advertisements/information they request the DofE shares with different segments.</div>
<h4>Use of Cookies</h4>
</div>
<div>As is standard practice on many websites and online services, the DofE online services uses 'cookies' and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our services are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We also use cookies and other similar technologies to see if our online advertising is bringing people to our resources and services, such as EX<sup>2</sup> and other online training and downloads. We use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on our website, to make it even more rewarding as well as to study the effectiveness of our participant and network communications. We also use cookies to customise your experience and provide greater convenience each time you interact with our services.
