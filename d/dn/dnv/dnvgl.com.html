<p><strong><em>Use of cookies</em></strong><br>
The Website use cookies. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we put on your computer if you agree. These cookies allow us to distinguish you from other users of the website which helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website, &nbsp;to improve our site and to address security hazards. No cookie will contain information that will enable anyone to contact you via telephone, e-mail, or any other means.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cookies we use are ‘analytical’ cookies. They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the site when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way the Website works, for example by making sure users are finding what they need easily.</p>

<p>Several cookies will be set on your computer when you visit the Website, including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Google Analytics: _utma, _utmb, _utmc and _utmz. For more information about these cookies, please see <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies#cookiesSet">https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies#cookiesSet</a></p>

<p><strong>Your submission of Information: Completing forms, uploading information on the Website etc </strong><br>
If you choose to provide us with the Information via a form or to upload the Information on the Website, we will use the Information only for the Purpose.</p>

<p>If you choose to complete any DNV GL form, we will collect the Information by an automated process.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise specifically stated on a particular form or in connection with uploading of Information, we will not give your information to any third parties outside of DNV GL, commercial or otherwise, except when deemed necessary for the Purpose.</p>

<p>We will retain the Information provided by you only for so long as is reasonably appropriate under the applicable legislation.</p>

<p><strong>Orders</strong><br>
We request Information from the user on our secure order forms. The user must provide contact information (like name and address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). The Information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this Information is used to get in touch with the user.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
We take market standard precautions to protect the Information. When users submit sensitive information such as credit card numbers etc via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with market standard encryption software - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'browsing'. While we use SSL encryption to protect the Information online, we also take market standard steps to protect it offline. Access to the Information is given on a need-to-know basis.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission or processing can be guaranteed to be 100 % secure. Accordingly, despite our efforts to protect the Information, DNV GL is not in a position guarantee or warrant the security of the Information. Thus, theInformation is submitted at your own risk.</p>

All such changes will take effect once they have been posted on My DNV GL.&nbsp; You agree that it is your responsibility to monitor such updates and that your continued use of My DNV GL after such revisions will constitute your full acceptance of the amendments to the Privacy Statement. The Privacy Statement was last updated on the date stated at the beginning of this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;</p>
