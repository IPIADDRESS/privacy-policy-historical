<p><strong>Privacy statement</strong></p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Last update: June 23rd 2017</strong></h3>

<p>The website dnvgl.com is owned and operated by the Norwegian registered company DNV GL AS (“DNV GL” Veritasveien 1, 1363 Høvik, Norway).</p>

<p><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></p>

<p>This privacy statement applies to any processing of personal data on the website and our online subscription service (“My DNV GL”). In the following dnvgl.com and My DNV GL are referred to as the “Website”.</p>

<p>Personal data in this regard shall mean any information relating to an individual who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that individual.</p>

<p>Processing shall mean any operation which is performed on personal data, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p>

<p><strong><em>What categories of personal data we process</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Personal data actively provided by you</em></p>

<p>We will process personal data actively provided by you, e.g. when you register with us, send us requests or questions or place orders. Such personal data may contain inter alia your name, address, contact data, request and order information as well as financial and billing information (like credit card number, expiration date).&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Personal data automatically collected when you browse the Website</em></p>

<p>When you visit the Website to browse information it contains, we will gather and store certain information (e.g. IP address, the browser used, the date and time of visit, pages visited) about your visit automatically.</p>

<p><em>Anonymous information collection</em></p>

<p>The Website automatically logs visitor information from which aggregated de-identified summary statistics are created such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the type of Internet browser and operating system of the computer most used to access the Website;</li>
	<li>peak hours and visiting times for the Website;</li>
	<li>most popular pages on the Website</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>The purposes for which we process personal data</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Personal data actively provided by you</em>&nbsp;may be used to enable us to communicate with you with regards to the products and services in which you have registered an interest, to make available targeted information and provide you with e-mail information on our services and to provide you with a Website account or to reply to and process and bill any requests or orders made.</p>

<p><em>Personal data gathered automatically</em>&nbsp;is used for only two purposes: (i) for the provision of the Website and Website management and (ii) for law enforcement and possible criminal prosecution, in the case of suspected unauthorized activity.</p>

<p><em>Anonymous information</em>&nbsp;is used for the purpose of improving our services, in particular to help us make the Website more useful to visitors, such as assessing what information is of most and least interest to visitors, and for other purposes such as determining the Website's technical design specifications and identifying system performance or problem areas.</p>

<p>Any personal data may be provided to other entities within DNV GL for the purposes set out above. DNV GL consists of DNV GL Group AS&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dnvgl.com/about/in-brief/corporate-governance.html">with subsidiaries</a>&nbsp;(“DNV GL”). We will not pass the personal data on to any third party outside DNV GL unless transparently communicated.</p>

<p><strong><em>Retention periods</em></strong></p>

<p>Personal data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer needed for the purpose it was collected for.</p>

</ul>

For more information about cookies, see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<p><em>Google Analytics</em></p>

<p>This Website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help the Website analyse how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.</p>

<p>The Website uses Google Analytic’s IP anonymisation function. Google will truncate/anonymise the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. On our behalf, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website, compiling reports on Website activity and providing other services relating to Website activity and internet usage to us. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this Website.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you can prevent Google’s collection and use of data (cookies and IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en. An opt-out cookie will be set to prevent the future collection of your information when you visit this Website.</p>

<p>Further information can be found under http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html.</p>

<p><strong><em>Security</em></strong></p>

<p>We take market standard precautions to protect personal data. When users submit sensitive information such as credit card numbers etc. via the Website, such information is protected both online and offline. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with market standard encryption software - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked. While we use SSL encryption to protect personal data online, we also take market standard steps to protect it offline. Access to the personal data is given on a need-to-know basis.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission or processing can be guaranteed to be 100 % secure. Accordingly, despite our efforts to protect the personal data, DNV GL is not in a position to guarantee or warrant the security of the personal data.</p>

<p><strong><em>Data subjects’ rights</em></strong></p>

<p>You may be entitled to exercise some or all of the following rights free of charge:</p>

<ol>
	<li>require (i) information whether your personal data is retained and (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of your personal data retained, including the purposes of the processing, the categories of data concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the data are disclosed and where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;</li>
	<li>request proper rectification, removal or restriction of your personal data, e.g. because (i) of the incomplete or inaccurate nature of the personal data, (ii) it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, (iii) the consent on which the processing was based has been withdrawn, or (iv) you have taken advantage of an existing right to object to the data processing; in case your personal data is processed by third parties, we will forward your request for rectification, removal or restriction also to such third parties unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort;</li>
	<li>receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from our side; where technically feasible you shall have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from us to another controller,</li>
	<li>refuse to provide and – without impact to data processing activities that have taken place before such withdrawal – withdraw your consent to processing of your personal data at any time;</li>
	<li>object at any time, out grounds relating to your particular situation, that your personal data shall be subject to a collection, processing or use;</li>
	<li>not to be subject to any automatic individual decisions (automatic decisions based on data processing by automatic means, for the purpose of assessing several personal aspects) which produce legal effects on you or similarly significantly affect you;</li>
	<li>take legal actions in relation to any breach of your rights regarding the processing of your personal data, as well as to lodge complaints before the competent data protection regulators.</li>
</ol>
