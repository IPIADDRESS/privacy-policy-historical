Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining 
our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is 
collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on every page of our site.
<p>

<b>The Way We Use Information</b>
</p><p>
We use email addresses to confirm registration upon the creation of a new account.
</p><p>
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other 
purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
</p><p>
On occasion we may send email to addresses of registered users to inform them about changes or new features added to our site.
</p><p>
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. 
For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or 
that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything 
that could be used to identify those individuals.
</p><p>
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated 
to the ones described above.
</p><p>
<b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b>
</p><p>
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put 
in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information 
we collect online. 

</p><p>
<b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b>
</p><p>
DNSBL.info expects its partners, advertisers and third-party affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. 
However, third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible 
through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during 
your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a DNSBL.info page, certain content that 
is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through DNSBL.info you may be introduced to, or be able 
to access, information, Web sites, advertisements, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. 
DNSBL.info is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the 
applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated 
by a third party.
</p><p>
While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other 
technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, 
some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to 
determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Through features available on our site, 
third parties may use cookies or other technology to gather information. DNSBL.info does not control the 
use of this technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any actions or policies of 
such third parties.
</p><p>
Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. Should you choose to voluntarily disclose Personally 
Identifiable Information on our site, such as in message boards, chat areas or in advertising or notices you 
post, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our 
knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities 
are beyond the control of DNSBL.info and this policy.
</p><p>
<b>Changes to this policy</b>
</p><p>
DNSBL.info reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. 
Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. 
Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that 
applied at the time the information was collected.
