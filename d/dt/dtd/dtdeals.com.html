      privacy rights of visitors to this web site. This privacy statement 
      discloses the privacy practices for this Dealtree-operated website. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Dealtree Privacy Statement<br>
      </b>This privacy statement describes the measures we have taken to 
      safeguard and protect your privacy, while providing you with a unique and 
      rewarding online experience. We use your IP address to help diagnose 
      problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address 
      is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad 
      demographic information. This website uses cookies to keep track of items 
      in your shopping cart during your website visit. We use cookies to deliver 
      content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't 
      have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. Information collected by 
      Dealtree is used for the purposes of processing orders, keeping you 
      informed about your order status, for statistical purposes and for 
      improving this Dealtree-operated website and its performance. This 
      Dealtree-operated website uses secure order forms for customers to request 
      information, to trade items, or purchase products. We may request 
      personally identifiable information such as customer's contact information 
      (like your name, email address, address, telephone number) and financial 
      information (like your credit card information). Contact information 
      collected from secure online forms is used to send orders and information 
      about our company to our clients and fulfillment partners. Your contact 
      information is also used to get in touch with you when necessary. You may 
      opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section 
      below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill you for 
      products and services. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Security<br>
      </b>This site has taken certain security measures to protect the loss, 
      misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Dealtree has 
      implemented a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your 
      personally identifiable information. Your personally identifiable 
      information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by 
      a limited number of employees who have special access rights. When you 
      place orders or access your personally identifiable information, we offer 
      the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information supplied by 
      you is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and securely 
      stored in Dealtree's database. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Service Providers and Dealtree’s Information Sharing Practices <br>
      </b>Dealtree uses third party service providers to receive and inspect 
      your shipped product, fill and deliver your order, charge your credit 
      card, and provide customer service. Third party service providers and 
      suppliers are required to keep confidential any personally identifiable 
      information received on behalf of Dealtree and are not to use it for any 
      purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.
      <br>
      <br>
      Where applicable, Dealtree may disclose personally identifiable 
      information to its product suppliers for the purposes of automated 
      manufacturer warranty registration, sales reporting, and third party 
      warranty registration.<br>
      <br>
      We may also share personally identifiable information in connection with 
      law enforcement, fraud prevention, and other legal action, or if Dealtree 
      reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to protect Dealtree, its 
      customers or the public. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Dealtree does not sell, trade, or rent your personally identifiable 
      information to others.<br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Co-branded Sites<br>
      </b>Co-branded sites are websites that Dealtree hosts, operates and 
      manages for its clients under the client’s logo or trademarks. We collect 
      customer data and share certain personally identifiable information as 
      appropriate with our respective clients based on their disclosed privacy 
      policies.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Links to Other Web Sites<br>
      </b>Please note that Dealtree has links to other web sites. When you click 
      on one of these links, you leave Dealtree and go to another web site. We 
      encourage you to read the privacy statements of these sites, to which we 
      link, as their privacy policy may differ from ours. <br>
      <br>
