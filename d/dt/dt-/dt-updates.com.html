<h2>Our Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3>What kind of information does Disc Soft collect?</h3>

<p>We may collect personal information from you when you save or otherwise provide your personal information to us, such as by setting up a user account and password, logging in as a registered user of <a href="/home">www.daemon-tools.cc</a>, purchasing through a website a product license, feature(s), instance, update, upgrade, the right to use product for commercial use or any term subscription, downloading product executables and installers, activating or revoking product licences, providing an email for paid or free subscription activation, providing information in your account (and you might have more than one, if you've used more than one email address when shopping with us), interacting with us by phone, email, Support Center, forum or through our websites, mobile optimized websites, or otherwise or if you complete an entry form to participate in a contest, promotion or survey or apply for partnership programs. As a result of these actions, you might supply us with personal information, such as your name, e-mail and postal addresses, phone number(s), names of people to whom licenses and subscriptions have been assigned, including address and telephone numbers, product interest information and financial information and in certain circumstances, your opinions and individual preferences.

<h3>Does Disc Soft share my information with third parties</h3>

<p>If you visit or purchase products on the <a href="/home">www.daemon-tools.cc</a> website, participate in a contest, giveaway, bundle, survey, promotion or special offer, or shop at <a href="/home">www.daemon-tools.cc</a> or any Disc Soft Affiliate/Partner, we may share your personal information with that Disc Soft Affiliate/Partner, so that it can communicate with you (whether by e-mail, post or otherwise) and provide you with promotional materials and additional information about its products, services, contests, promotions and special offers that may be of interest to you, or collect and use that information subject to and for other purposes contemplated by this Policy.</p>

<p>We may use a third party service provider to conduct our contests, giveaways, bundles,  surveys, promotions or special offers; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personal information for any other purpose. We will not share the personal information you provide through our contests, giveaways, bundles, surveys, promotions or special offers with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>

<p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to non-affiliated third parties except as permitted by law or as outlined within this Policy. However, in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of our business or another similar transaction, we may transfer or disclose your personal information to a purchaser or prospective purchaser, who may collect, use and disclose such information for the purposes of evaluating the proposed transaction or operating and managing the affairs of the acquired business, or for other purposes identified in this Policy. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>

<p>The collection, use, and disclosure of information contemplated in this Policy may involve a transfer of the information to jurisdictions located outside your country of residence that may not have equivalent laws and rules regarding personally identifiable information. By way of example, this may happen if one of our service providers is located in a country outside your home country. In these cases, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law, and as necessary to protect the property, interests and rights of Disc Soft and the Disc Soft Affiliates/Partners.</p>

<h3>How is personal information secured?</h3>

<p>We have adopted appropriate measures to ensure the confidentiality of personal information and to safeguard personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification, in light of, among other things, the sensitivity of the information and the purposes for which it is to be used. When you enter sensitive information (such as email, account password, postal address, name and phone number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Since we use external payment gateway services, we do not store sensitive credit card data on our systems. Furthermore, each and every Disc Soft employee, mandatory or agent must abide by this Policy. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site or our software applications, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@disc-soft.com">privacy@disc-soft.com</a>.</p>
