CalOPPA is the first state law in the United States that requires
commercial websites and online services to publish a privacy policy. The
law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any individual or
company in the US (and conceivably the world) that operates sites
collecting PII from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy
policy on its website stating precisely the information that it collects
and those individuals or companies with whom it is shared.

this principle individuals not only have enforceable rights against data
users but also that they have recourse to courts or legal agencies to
investigate and/or prosecute by data processors.
