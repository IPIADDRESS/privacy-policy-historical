                    <u>Information Collected By Automated Means -</u>
                    We may use cookies, web beacons/pixel tags, log files, and other technologies to collect certain information about visitors to our website, use of our
                    online features, and interactions with our emails and online advertisements. For example, through these means, we may collect your browser type and
                    operating system, viewed web pages, links that are clicked, IP address, sites visited before coming to our website, emails we send that you open, forward,
                    or click through to our website. Collecting this information, and linking it with your personally-identifiable information, helps us to best tailor our

                <p>
                    We also may use third party advertisements placed by ad networks to support our site. Some of these advertisers and ad networks may use technology such as
                    cookies and web beacons/pixel tags when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers and ad networks information including your IP
                    address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and whether you have Flash installed. Some of these advertisers and ad networks also may use
                    anonymous data, such as demographic data, received from third parties to assist in the delivery of advertisements to you. These advertisers and ad networks
                    use the information described above to provide you relevant advertisements based on your online behavior, search activities on our site and on other third
                    party sites, demographic information and/or relevant to your general location, so that the advertising you see on our site more closely reflects your
                    interests and needs. For example, if you search for or browse a, recipe or product on our site, you may see an advertisement from a third party with
                    information about, or an offer similar to, that for which you were searching or browsing on our site, or an offer related to a third party whose site you
                    have visited in the past.

                    <u>Information Collected From Other Sources </u>

                    third parties. This information may include name, demographic information, interests, and publicly-observed data, such as from social media and shopping

            <div>
                <p>
                    <u>Personally-Identifiable Information</u>
                    – We may share information among our various businesses and brands within The J.M. Smucker Company and its subsidiaries. We may provide your personal
                    information to third parties who provide services on our behalf. For example, we use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card
                    processing company to bill for goods. We use other third parties to provide promotions, contests, newsletters and hosting for our site. These service
                    providers may use the information solely in conjunction with the specific services they provide for us. These service providers are not authorized to use,
                    share, retain or store your personally-identifiable information for any other purpose. We may conduct joint promotions with other companies, and may share
                    with these promotional partners (and their service providers) personally-identifiable information necessary to conduct the promotion. We may also use and
                    disclose personally-identifiable information where we think it is necessary to investigate or prevent actual or expected fraud, or criminal activity or
                    injury or damage to us or others, including when requested or required by law enforcement or government officials. We will not share
                    personally-identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties. For California residents, please see Opting Out, below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>Aggregate Information (non-personally-identifiable)</u>
                    - We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers who perform services on our behalf. This
                    information does not identify individual users. We do this for online data analysis and research purposes to help provide our users with relevant tool and
                    features. We do not link aggregate user data with personally-identifiable information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <u>For California Residents</u>
                    - We may share your personally-identifiable information with affiliated third parties, some of which do not share the name of The J.M. Smucker Company, for
                    their own direct marketing purposes. Because this category of affiliates is considered to be “unaffiliated parties” under California Law, you may opt out
                    of us sharing with them. To opt out, please send a letter with your name, postal address, e-mail, with the heading “California Privacy Rights” to:

            <div>
                <p>
                    The security of personally-identifiable information is important to us. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against

                <p>
                    You should keep in mind, however, that no data transmitted over the Internet is 100% secure and any information disclosed online can potentially be
                    collected and used by parties other than the intended recipient. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee or warrant
