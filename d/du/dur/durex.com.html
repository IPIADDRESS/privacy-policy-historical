<h1 style="font-size:140%; ">Privacy Statement</h1>
<p><strong>General</strong><br>
  RB UK Commercial Limited and its affiliated companies (“Reckitt Benckiser”)  respects the privacy of every individual who visits our sites or responds to  our interactive advertisements and other communications. This Privacy Statement  outlines the information Reckitt Benckiser will collect and how we will use  that information. This Statement will also instruct you on what to do if you do  not want your personal information collected or shared when you visit Reckitt  Benckiser sites or respond to our advertisements and other communications. </p>
<p>We may modify this Privacy Statement and you should  therefore periodically visit this page to be sure that you have read and agree  with our most current privacy statement. </p>
<p><strong>Personally  Identifiable Information</strong><br>
Reckitt Benckiser will not collect any personally  identifiable information about you (that is, your name, address, telephone  number, or email address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily.<strong></strong></p>
<p>When you provide personally  identifiable information to us, we may ask if you want to receive future  communication from us, such as newsletters, email or other information. You can  choose not to receive this communication, if you wish.<br>
  <br>
  If you do not want your personally identifiable information collected, please  do not submit it to us. If you have already submitted this information and  would like us to remove it from our records, please visit the "contact us"  page on the brand web site. </p>
<p>Personal information collected on the site may be  stored or processed in your country of residence or any other country in which  Reckitt Benckiser or its subcontractors or agents maintain facilities and by  using the site, you consent to any transfer of information outside your country  of residence. Reckitt Benckiser will ensure  that if information is transferred outside your country of residence it will be  treated in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>In addition to providing you with the service or  information you request, your personally identifiable information may also be  used to help us track the way you use our site and our products. We may also  combine the information you provide with information that we collect  separately, including information you have provided to other organisations  (with consent that it can be shared) as well as public information. All of this information will help us, for  example, better design our products, web sites and advertisements. In order to  do this, we may also share your information with companies who carry out work  for us. These companies have agreed to only use your information in the way we  tell them and to have procedures in place to protect the information. </p>
<p>If we share your information with a company, other  than as set out above, we will contact you first and give you the opportunity  to remove your information from our database unless you have already given your  consent to this.</p>
<p>We will retain your information for a reasonable  period or as long as the law requires.</p>
<p> <strong>Children</strong><br>
  Reckitt Benckiser has no intention of collecting any personally identifiable  information (that is, name, address, telephone number, or email address) from  individuals under the age of thirteen years. Where appropriate, Reckitt  Benckiser will specifically instruct children not to submit such information.  If a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, a parent  or guardian of that child should visit the "contact us" page on the brand  web site if they would like this information deleted from  our records. </p>
<p> <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information  Collected Automatically</strong><br>
  In some cases, we may collect information about you  that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information  include the type of Internet Browser you are using, the type of computer  operating system you are using, and the domain name of the site from which you  linked to our site or advertisement. We use this information for the purposes  of better understanding our customers’ interests and to help improve our  business and sites.</p>
<p> <strong>Information We May Place Automatically  On Your Computer's Hard Drive</strong> <br>
  When you view one of our sites or advertisements, we may store some information  on your computer. For example, this information may be in the form of a  "Cookie" or similar file that will allow us to tailor a site or  advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. With most  Internet Browsers, you can erase Cookies from your computer hard drive, block  all Cookies, or receive a warning before a Cookie is stored. Please refer to  your Browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.  Please note that removing or blocking Cookies may interfere with your full use  of our site.<br>
