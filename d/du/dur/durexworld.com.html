                            A. Information Collected
                        </h2>
                        <p align="left">This privacy policy applies only to information collected on the Sites and does not apply to information collected by RB through any other means.</p>
<p align="left">We collect two types of information from visitors to the Sites: (1) Personally Identifiable Information; and (2) Non- Personally Identifiable Information, such as your IP address or cookies.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>(1) Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p align="left">"Personally Identifiable Information" is information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, or company name. RB collects and stores the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us on the Sites, including as follows::</p>
<p align="left">We may collect your first and last name and product or service details if you contact us with a question related to our products or services; <br> We may collect your first and last name, mailing address and billing information if you purchase a product or service on the Sites; <br> We may collect registration details about a product that you purchase from RB and this information may be tied to your name and mailing address; <br> We may collect your first and last name, mailing information, email address and billing information if you download information from a Site; <br> We may collect your name, email address or phone number if you contact us with a question; We may collect your first and last name, date of birth and email address if you choose to participate in a contest or sweepstakes; and/or <br> We may collect your name and mobile phone number if you consent to receive autodialed and/or pre-recorded telemarketing messages from or on behalf of us at your mobile number. If you do not want RB to collect your personally identifiable information, please do not provide it to us.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p align="left">"Non-Personally Identifiable Information" can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, location, gender or interests. Non-personally identifiable information does NOT identify you personally. Here are some examples of the non-personally identifiable information that is collected via the Sites:</p>
<p align="left">Internet Protocol (IP) address -- Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the webpages you view.</p>
<p align="left">Cookie -- A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on the Sites. For example, when someone visits a page within the Sites, a cookie is placed on the user's machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited the Sites previously. Cookies may also be used to track users across the Web. We use the information we collect from cookies for marketing and product planning purposes. Collected data may also be shared, in aggregate form, with third-parties (e.g., dealers, marketers, and distributors). We do not currently honor any “do-not-track” signal sent by browsers. However, you may opt-out of targeted advertising from National Advertising Initiative members by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. You may also set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users to our Sites. Additionally, some of the cookies we use may be flash cookies or Adobe cookies. While they are harmless, they may contain non-personally identifiable information and depending on your browser these cookies may not normally be deleted when your cookies are deleted. Please check your browser to determine where these types of cookies are stored and how they may be deleted.</p>
<p align="left">Web Beacons (also known as "clear gifs," "web bugs" or "pixel tags") -- "Web Beacons" are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Sites and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages.</p>
<p align="left">Product Information -- We may collect registration information or other details about your product or service. Unless this information is tied to your name or address, it is not considered personally identifiable. We may collect the above non-personally identifiable information from all visitors to our Sites. If you do not want RB to have access to this information, please do not visit our Sites.</p>

                        <p align="left"><strong>(1) Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>We use your personally identifiable information that is collected on these Sites primarily for the following purposes:</p>
<p>To deliver services; To alert you to special offers, updated information and other new products or services from RB, or other third parties, or to forward promotional materials to you (subject to your right to opt out of receiving such alerts or promotional materials as outlined in Section F below); To complete a transaction or service requested by you; To ensure the Sites are relevant to your needs; To help us create and publish content most relevant to you; To notify you about a material change to this privacy policy or our Terms of Use, if necessary; To allow you access to limited-entry areas of the Sites; and To contact you in response to sign up forms such as Contact Us or other inquiry. In addition, if you email us a question, we may use your email address to process your request and respond to your question. Also, if you are entering a sweepstakes or contest, we may use your personally identifiable information in order to fulfill the terms of that promotion.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>(1) Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>We may share or disclose your personally identifiable information in the following instances:</p>
<p>To our parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates in order to better serve you. RB may have to share your data with these parties in order to provide you with services that have been requested by you, or so that we can ensure our services and products are meeting your needs.</p>
<p>To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents or independent contractors who help us maintain our Sites and provide other administrative services to us (including, but not limited to, order processing and fulfillment, providing customer service, maintaining and analyzing data, sending customer communications on RB's behalf, and entry collection, winner selection and prize fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes and other promotions). We seek to ensure that these unaffiliated third parties will not use the personally identifiable information for any other purpose than to provide the administrative services for which they are responsible. Because such unaffiliated third-party service providers that help us administer our Sites will have access to users' personally identifiable information, if you do not wish for our unaffiliated third-party service providers to have access to your information, please do not register or submit any personally identifiable information to us.</p>
<p>To complete your purchase. If you choose to make a purchase on the Sites, we may collect from you your credit card number, billing address and other information related to such purchase, and we may use such collected information in order to fulfill your purchase. We may also provide such information, or other personally identifiable information provided by you, to unaffiliated third parties as necessary to complete your purchase (for example, to process your credit card).</p>
<p>To comply with the law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the requirements of law or comply with legal process or other government requests served on us (including in response to lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), protect and defend our rights or property, including the rights and property of RB, or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our end users.</p>
<p>To third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.</p>
<p>To track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.</p>
<p>To protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the information collected from these Sites. In the course of such verification, we may receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, if you use a credit card or debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.</p>
<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy or at the time we request the information, we do not otherwise use, share or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information to any third parties.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>We use non-personally identifiable information collected on the Sites in the manner disclosed above, in the Section A (2). We may share this non-personal information with our fulfilment partners for research and statistical purposes.</p>

                            EU - U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD
                        </h2>
                        <p>RB complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States.&nbsp; In doing so, RB has certified that, in respect of all personal data it receives from the EU, it will adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of: Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfers, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.&nbsp; If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To access the Privacy Shield List, and to find details of RB's certification, please visit <a href="http://www.privacyshield.gov/">www.privacyshield.gov</a>.</p>
<p>RB's participation in the Privacy Shield applies to all personal data that is subject to this privacy policy and is received from the European Union or European Economic Area.&nbsp; RB will comply with the Privacy Shield Principles in respect of such personal data.&nbsp; Please note that some Non-Personally Identifiable Information (as described above) that originates from the EU or the EEA may be classed as personal information for the purposes of Privacy Shield Framework (e.g. IP addresses; cookie IDs and other online identifiers; and profile information that is not necessarily linked to a named individual).</p>
<p>Where RB transfers personal data from the EU to its third party agents and service providers, it will require such third parties to process the information only for the purposes described this privacy policy and to provide the same level of protection for the information as required by the Privacy Shield Principles.&nbsp; RB remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless RB proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
<p>If you believe that RB is processing your personal data within the scope of its Privacy Shield certification, you may direct any inquiries or complaints concerning its Privacy Shield compliance in the following ways:</p>
<p>(1) In the first instance, please send your inquiry or complaint to consumer.relations@rb.com or by writing to the following mailing address:</p>
<p>Reckitt Benckiser LLC <br> 399 Interpace Parkway <br> Parsippany, NJ 07054-0225 <br> Attn: Consumer Relations</p>
<p>RB will respond within 45 days.</p>
<p>(2) If you are not satisfied with RB's response, or for complaints that cannot be resolved with RB directly, RB has committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield via the American Arbitration Association – International Centre for Dispute Resolution, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.&nbsp; If you do not receive a timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by us, please visit: &nbsp;<a href="http://info.adr.org/safeharbor">http://info.adr.org/safeharbor</a> for more information and to file a complaint directly with the AAA. (3) Further, your complaint can be made or referred to the US Department of Commerce or the Federal Trade Commission for further investigation.</p>
<p>(4) If you do not resolve your complaint via one of the above routes, a binding arbitration option will also be made available to you to address such residual complaints under certain conditions.&nbsp; To find out more about the Privacy Shield's binding arbitration scheme, please see <a href="http://privacyshield.gov/article?id=My-Rights-under-Privacy-Shield">http://privacyshield.gov/article?id=My-Rights-under-Privacy-Shield</a>.</p>
<p>RB's commitments under the Privacy Shield are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission.</p>
