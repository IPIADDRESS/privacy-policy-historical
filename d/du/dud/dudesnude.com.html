		<li>
			Introduction
		</li>

		<ol>
			<li>
				We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website users.
			</li>
			<li>
				This policy applies where we are acting as a data controller with respect to the personal data of
				our
				website users; in other words, where we determine the purposes and means of the processing of that
				personal
				data.
			</li>
			<li>
				We use cookies on our website.
			</li>
			<li>
				Our website
				incorporates privacy controls which affect how we will process your personal
				data. By using the privacy controls, you can control which optional emails
				you'd like to receive and limit the publication of your information. You can access
				the privacy controls in 'Settings' via the following URL after logging in to
				the web site:
									<a href="https://dudesnude.com/edit.php?editpage=3">https://dudesnude.com/edit.php?editpage=3</a>
							</li>
			<li>
				In this policy, "we", "us" and "our" refer to Ponyhof LLC.

			</li>
		</ol>

		<li>
			How we use your personal data
		</li>

		<ol>
			<li>
				In this Section 2 we have set out:
			</li>
			<ol>
				<li>
					the general categories of personal data that we may process;
				</li>
				<li>
					in the case of personal data that we did not obtain directly from you, the source and specific
					categories of that data;
				</li>
				<li>
					the purposes for which we may process personal data; and
				</li>
				<li>
					the legal bases of the processing.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<li>
				We may process data about your use of our website and services ("<b>usage data</b>"). The
				usage data may include your IP address, geographical location, browser type and version, operating
				system, and referral source. The source of the usage data is our analytics system. This usage data
				may
				be processed for the purposes of analysing the use of the website and services, for troubleshooting
				user
				problems and maintaining back-ups of our databases. The legal basis for this processing is our
				legitimate interests, namely monitoring and improving our website and services.
			</li>

			<li>
				We may process your account data ("<b>account data</b>"). The account data includes your
				email
				address provided by yourself and information about your use of the website recorded by our
				administration team. The account data may be processed for the purposes of operating our website,
				providing our services, ensuring the security of our website and services, maintaining back-ups of
				our
				databases and communicating with you. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate
				interests,
				namely the proper administration of our website and business.
			</li>

			<li>
				We may process your information included in your personal profile on our website ("<b>profile
					data</b>"). The profile data provided by yourself may include your profile text, profile
				pictures and videos, date of birth, physical attributes and sexual preferences. The profile data may
				be
				processed for the purposes of providing our services, enabling your use of the website and
				maintaining
				back-ups of our databases. The legal basis for this processing is consent. Insofar as such data can
				be
				considered "special category data" under article 9.2 of the EU GDPR, our condition for processing is
				that processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by you choosing to publish
				said data in your public profile on our website.
			</li>
			<li>
				We may process your personal data that are provided by you in the course of your use of our services
				("<b>service data</b>"). The service data may include messages sent by yourself to other
				users
				and
				information saved by yourself such as other user profiles. The service data may be processed for the
				purposes of operating our website, providing our services, ensuring the security of our website and
				services and maintaining back-ups of our databases. The legal basis for this processing is consent.
			</li>
			<li>
				We may process information contained in or relating to any communication that you send to us
				("<b>correspondence data</b>"). The correspondence data may include the communication
				content
				and metadata
				associated with the communication. The correspondence data may be processed for the purposes of
				communicating with you and record-keeping. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate
				interests, namely the proper administration of our website and business and communications with
				users.
			</li>
			<li>
				We may process any of your personal data identified in this policy where necessary for the
				establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an
				administrative
				or out-of-court procedure. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests, namely
				the
				protection and assertion of our legal rights, your legal rights and the legal rights of others.
			</li>
			<li>
				We may process any of your personal data identified in this policy where necessary for the purposes
				of
				managing risks. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests, namely the proper
				protection of our business against risks.
			</li>
			<li>
				In addition to the specific purposes for which we may process your personal data set out in this
				Section
				2, we may also process any of your personal data where such processing is necessary for compliance
				with
				a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital
				interests of another natural person.
			</li>
			<li>
				Please do not supply any other person's personal data to us, unless we prompt you to do so.
			</li>

		</ol>

		<li>
			Automated decision-making
		</li>

		<ol>
			<li>
				We will use your personal data for the purposes of automated decision-making in relation to
				automatic
				expiry of your user data.
			</li>
			<li>
				This automated decision-making will involve the sending of emails warning that disabling or deletion
				of
				an inactive profile is scheduled to occur, and the deletion or disabling of the profile if the user
				does
				not log in to the website within the specified time.
			</li>
			<li>
				The significance and possible consequences of this automated decision-making are loss of user data
				through automatic deletion of an inactive profile.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<li>
			Providing your personal data to others
		</li>

		<ol>
			<li>
				We may disclose your personal data to our professional advisers insofar as reasonably necessary for
				the
				purposes of managing risks, obtaining professional advice, or the establishment, exercise or defence
				of
				legal
				claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure.
			</li>
			<li>
				In addition to the specific disclosures of personal data set out in this Section 4, we may disclose
				your
				personal data where such disclosure is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we
				are
				subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural
				person.
				We may also disclose your personal data where such disclosure is necessary for the establishment,
				exercise or defence
				of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure.
			</li>
			<li>
				Should ownership of our site transfer to another company in full, we may transfer your data to that
				company in order to continue to provide you with the service you have signed up to receive under our
				terms of
				service and privacy policy.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<li>
			International transfers of your personal data
		</li>

		<ol>
			<li>
				In this Section 5, we provide information about the circumstances in which your personal data may be
				transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
			</li>
			<li>
				The hosting facilities for our website are situated in Canada and the USA. The European Commission
				has
				made an "adequacy decision" with respect to the data protection laws of Canada. Transfers
				to
				the USA
				will be protected by Privacy Shield, this framework is compliant with EU privacy law under Privacy
				Directive 1995/46/EC.
			</li>
			<li>
				You acknowledge that personal data that you submit for publication through our website or services
				may
				be available, via the internet, around the world. We cannot prevent the use (or misuse) of data you
				choose to
				publish in your public profile.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<li>
			Retaining and deleting personal data
		</li>

		<ol>
			<li>
				This Section 6 sets out our data retention policies and procedure, which are designed to help ensure
				that we comply with our legal obligations in relation to the retention and deletion of personal
				data.
			</li>
			<li>
				Personal data that we process for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is
				necessary
				for that purpose or those purposes.
			</li>
			<li>
				We will retain your personal data as follows:
			</li>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<b>"correspondence data"</b> will be retained for a maximum period of 1 year.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>"usage data" and "profile data"</b> will be retained for a maximum period of 8 weeks
					following
					the deletion of the data or your profile by yourself or us.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>"account data"</b> will be retained as per (b) above, unless you create a new profile before
					a
					previous profile is purged from our system, in which case "account data" from your previous
					profile
					may be retained
					and attached to your new profile.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>"service data"</b> will be retained as per (b) above with the exception of messages sent to
					other
					members which will be retained on the system until the recipient deletes the message or his
					profile
					is deleted by
					himself or us.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<li>
				Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6, we may retain your personal data where such
				retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order
				to
				protect your
				vital interests, the vital interests of another natural person or to ensure the security of our
				website.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<li>
			Amendments
		</li>

		<ol>
			<li>
				We may update this policy from time to time by publishing a new version on our website.
			</li>
			<li>
				You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy with any changes to this policy.
			</li>
			<li>
				We may notify you of changes to this policy which by our sole discretion are material by email or by
				a
				pop up message at login.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<li>
			Your rights
		</li>

		<ol>
			<li>
				In this Section 8, we have summarised the rights that individuals have under EU data protection law.
				Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries.
				Accordingly, you
				should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of
				these rights.
			</li>
			<li>
				Your principal rights under data protection law are:
			</li>
			<ol>
				<li>
					the right to access;
				</li>
				<li>
					the right to rectification;
				</li>
				<li>
					the right to erasure;
				</li>
				<li>
					the right to restrict processing;
				</li>
				<li>
					the right to object to processing;
				</li>
				<li>
					the right to data portability;
				</li>
				<li>
					the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and
				</li>
				<li>
					the right to withdraw consent.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<li>
				You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we
				do,
				access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional
				information
				includes
				details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the
				recipients
				of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply
				to
				you a copy of
				your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be
				subject
				to a reasonable fee.
			</li>
			<li>
				You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account
				the
				purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.
			</li>
			<li>
				In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay.
				Those
				circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for
				which
				they
				were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object
				to
				the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; and the personal data have
				been
				unlawfully
				processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include
				where
				processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for
				compliance with a legal
				obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
			</li>
			<li>
				In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those
				circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you
				oppose
				erasure; we no
				longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for
				the
				establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the
				verification of
				that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your
				personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment,
				exercise or defence of
				legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of
				important public interest.
			</li>
			<li>
				You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your
				particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the
				processing is
				necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
				any
				official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a
				third
				party. If you
				make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate
				compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms,
				or
				the processing is
				for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
			</li>
			<li>
				You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical
				research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless
				the
				processing is
				necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.
			</li>
			<li>
				To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is:
			</li>
			<ol>
				<li>
					consent; or
				</li>
				<li>
					that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in
					order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and such processing is
					carried out by automated
					means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used
					and
					machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the
					rights and freedoms of
					others.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<li>
				If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you
				have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data
				protection.
				You may do
				so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged
				infringement.
			</li>
			<li>
				To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you
				have
				the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of
				processing
				before
				the withdrawal.
			</li>
			<li>
				You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us by
				email.
			</li>

			About cookies
		</li>

		<ol>
			<li>
				A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web
				server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server
				each time the
				browser requests a page from the server.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent
				cookie
				will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by
				the
				user
				before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user
				session,
				when the web browser is closed.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<li>
			Cookies that we use
		</li>

		<ol>
			<li>
				We use cookies for the following purposes:
			</li>
			<ol>
				<li>
					session management - we use temporary "session" cookies to maintain your session while you are
					using our website. cookies used for this purpose are: PHPSESSID, ua_c2
				</li>
				<li>
					saving your login details - if you use the "remember me on this PC" (site members) or "remember
					token on this PC" (site visitors) option at login, we use persistent cookies to save your login
					or
					token information in
					your web browser. Cookies used for this purpose are: pw4, token_c.
				</li>
				<li>
					to improve the website and analyze how the website is used -
					we use a tool called "Google Analytics" to collect information about use of this site. Google
					Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit
					when
					they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information
					we
					get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP
					address
					assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying
					information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics
					with
					personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your
					web
					browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be
					used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google
					Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the
					<a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/" target="_blank">Google Analytics Terms of
						Use</a>
