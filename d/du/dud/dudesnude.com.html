</p>
<p>

<b>What Information Do We Collect?</b><br>

<p>

<b>Passive Information Collected</b>
</p>
<p>
What is a Cookie?  
</p>
<p>
Cookies are a feature of web browser (Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, etc.) software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a site.  They are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's web browser on one site to simplify subsequent interactions with that site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transaction on related web pages.  This makes it easier for a user to move from site to site and to complete transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalised.
</p>
<p>

Our site's servers also automatically identify your computer by its Internet Protocol address which is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider.  Your IP address may be used to address problems with our server or administer our site or to gather broad demographic information about our users.
</p>
<p>

Information we may gather:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Network IP address</li>
<li> Click - stream data </li>
<li> HTTP protocol elements</li>
<li> Search terms</li>
</ul>

 

<b>How Do We Use the Information Collected?</b><br>

Broadly speaking, persons we employ directly, or as contractors or agents at our direction, use Active Information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing customer services such as support, and making available other products or services we think may be of interest to our users.  We may use the Active Information or Passive Information you provide to us to contact you about changes to our site, new services, features or products we offer, or other information we think you shall find valuable.  If at any time you do not wish to receive such information, you may 'opt-out' of doing so by disabling informational emails in your web site settings, or by deleting your user profile.
<p>
We use Passive Information to gather information about our users and to enhance and design our site to make it easier, faster and friendlier to use.  Additionally, our site utilizes cookies to uniquely identify individual users as they move through the site. The site may also use cookies to store login information and user status information. Cookies are required to be turned on in your browser for you to be able to use our site. Passive Information may result in your viewing of particular advertising based on your user habits for your viewing on our site and a shopping experience customised to you in content, services and goods.

Except as specified in this policy we do not disclose your personal information to third parties.

<b>Sharing Information with Advertisers or Other Third Parties</b><br>

We may disclose anonymous information about user habits, characteristics and user patterns, based on aggregate user statistics to advertisers on our site.  The parties who perform services for us (credit card processors, merchant bank, our Internet Service Provider) may also have access to your information in performing such services.  Should we buy or sell assets of our company, another company may need to review our company's assets, including your information, to make business decisions as to whether to acquire such assets.
