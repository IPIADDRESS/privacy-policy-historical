                        	Any non-public personal information that you may provide
                        	via our sites will be used solely for the purpose stated
                        	on the page where it is collected. Duquesne University
                        	will not sell, license, transmit or disclose this
                        	information outside of Duquesne University  unless
                        	(a) expressly authorized by you, (b) necessary to enable
                        	Duquesne University contractors or agents to perform
                        	certain functions for us, or (c) required or permitted

                        <p>By “personal information,” we mean data
                        	that is unique to an individual, such as a name,
                        	address, Social Security number, e-mail address,
                        	or telephone number. From time to time, we may request
                        	personal information from you at our sites in order
                        	to deliver requested materials to you or respond
                        	to your questions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Your E-Mail</strong><br>
                        	Please note that your e-mail, like most, if not all,
                        	non-encrypted Internet e-mail communications, may
                        		be accessed and viewed by other Internet users,
                        		without your knowledge and permission, while in transit
                        		to us. For that reason, to protect your privacy, please
                        		do not use e-mail to communicate information
                        		to us that you consider confidential. If you wish,
                        		you may contact us instead via non-cellular telephone
                        		at the numbers provided at various locations on our
                        		sites.</p>
                        <p>There are some locations on Duquesne University’s websites
                        	where we have made special provisions for a more secure
                        	environment in which we can exchange information with
                        	you. At each of these locations, we will provide you
                        	with appropriate instructions.                        	</p>
                        <p><strong>Other Information / Cookies</strong><br>
                        	You should also be aware that when you visit our
                        		websites, we collect certain information that does
                        		not identify you personally, but provides us with “usage
                        		data,” such as the number of visitors we receive
                        		or what pages are visited most often. This data helps
                        		us to analyze and improve the usefulness of the information
                        		we provide at these websites.</p>
                        <p>Like most  website owners, we may also use
                        	what is known as “cookie” technology. A “cookie” is
                        	an element of data that a website can send to your browser
                        	when you link to that website. It is not a computer
                        	program and has no ability to read data residing on
                        	your computer or instruct it to perform any step or
                        	function. By assigning a unique data element to each
                        	visitor, the website is able to recognize repeat users,
                        	track usage patterns and better serve you when you return
                        	to that site. The cookie does not extract other personal
                        	information about you, such as your name or address.
                        	Most browsers provide a simple procedure that will enable
                        	you to control whether you want to receive cookies by
                        	notifying you when a website is about to deposit a cookie
                        	file.</p>
                        <p><strong>Linking to Other Sites</strong><br>
                        	From time to time, Duquesne University websites may provide links
                        		to other websites, not owned or controlled by
                        		Duquesne University, that we think might be useful or of interest
                        		to you. We cannot, however, be responsible for the
                        		privacy practices used by other website owners or the
                        		content or accuracy of those other websites. Links
                        		to various non-Duquesne University websites do not constitute or
                        		imply endorsement by Duquesne University of these websites, any products
                        		or services described on these sites, or of any other
                        		material contained in them.</p>
                        <p><strong>Security</strong><br>
                        	Duquesne University has adopted and adheres to stringent
                        		security standards designed to protect non-public
                        		personal information at duq.edu against accidental
                        		or unauthorized access or disclosure. Among the
                        		safeguards that Duquesne University has developed
                        		for this site are administrative, physical and
                        		technical barriers that together form a protective
                        		firewall around the information stored at this
                        		site. </p>
                        <p><strong>Changes to This Statement</strong><br>
                        	Duquesne University may change this Statement from
                        		time to time; when updates are made, the Web
                        		Privacy Statement version date (located at the
                        		bottom of this page) will also be updated to
                        		reflect that a revision occurred. We encourage
                        		you to periodically reread this page to see if
                        		there have been any changes that may affect you. This
                        		Statement is not intended to and does not create
