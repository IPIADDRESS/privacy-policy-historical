                     <h4>I. General Statement</h4>
                     
                     <p>PRIVACY is a word that conjures up strong convictions and an emotional reaction from
                        many of us. In the modern world, however, wondrous forms of electronic communication
                        render the protection of privacy interests much more difficult. We in the university
                        community are not immune from the lure of convenience and speed when we utilize our
                        information technology and electronic communication tools. It is, of course, part
                        of our mission to share knowledge and to collaborate within our academic community.
                        In doing so, however, we must recognize that these modern devices are never completely
                        secure. It is a fact of life that all computer systems and communication systems are
                        the subject of constant probing by outsiders ranging from the curious to the criminal.

                     <p>The University of Denver recognizes and respects the importance of confidentiality
                        and security of personal information in this increasingly open electronic age. The
                        University does not intend to sell, swap, rent, or otherwise disclose for commercial
                        purposes, outside the scope of ordinary University functions, your name, mailing address,
                        telephone number, e-mail address, or other information you provide.&nbsp;While the University
                        makes reasonable efforts to protect information provided to us, we cannot guarantee
                        that this information will remain secure and are not responsible for any loss or theft.

                     <p>When an individual is connected to the University of Denver network or uses a University-owned
                        computer, or other University-owned equipment, he/she agrees to abide by the rules
                        and regulations of the University (see the University Acceptable Use Policy incorporated
                        herein by this reference). While the University of Denver respects the desire and
                        need for privacy in this setting, the University reserves the right, at all times,
                        to search any and all hardware or software owned by the University, or connected to
                        the University network, for the purposes of preventing or investigating improper or
                        illegal use of University systems, or preventing or investigating system problems
                        or efficiencies. In the course of an individual's involvement with the University
                        community, software or third party systems that are used may require the individual
                        to divulge private or personal information. The University is not responsible for
                        the content, use or privacy of this information.

                     <h4>IV. University Website(s)</h4>
                     
                     <p>When users visit the University of Denver website(s), the webmaster collects information
                        concerning their Internet connection, which pages they visit on the site, the Internet
                        Protocol Number (IP) from which they accessed du.edu, and other general information
                        about their visit to the website. (Information associated with an individual IP Number
                        may be used for internal diagnostics and investigation of misconduct or security issues.)
                        The collection of this information is intended to help the University deliver efficient
                        and useful service and it may be used to analyze trends, create summary statistics
                        for determining technical design specifications, and to otherwise aid in monitoring
                        system performance. Such information is stored on a temporary basis and the University
                        will exercise reasonable care to release it only if legally mandated by law enforcement
                        investigators, required by court proceedings, or it is deemed necessary to internal
                        investigations of violations of University rules and regulations. The University does
                        not intend to sell, swap, rent, or otherwise disclose for commercial purposes, information
                        regarding the behavior, habits, or demographics of those who visit University controlled
                        websites. Certain parts of the University website(s) may require tracking techniques
                        to follow the user's progress through courses, materials or programs or to verify
                        information acquired from other sources. The University provides links to websites
                        outside the du.edu network and is not responsible for the content or privacy policies
                        of any website to which it may link.

                     <p>The University does not intend to monitor the contents of e-mail sent to or from University
                        servers, except to identify and correct problems with E-mail delivery or receipt,
                        to work with email system problems, or to deal with misconduct or security issues.
                        Electronic logs of who sends and receives e-mail through University servers are maintained
                        for a short period of time. This information may be used to analyze trends, create
                        summary statistics for internal planning purposes, and to otherwise aid in maintaining
                        system performance and security. E-mail related information is stored on a temporary
                        basis and may only be released if legally mandated by law enforcement investigators,
                        required by court proceedings, or it is deemed necessary to internal investigations
                        of violations of University rules and regulations. The names and e-mail addresses
                        of University of Denver students, faculty, and staff are available in a&nbsp;searchable&nbsp;index.

                                    Health and Counseling Center for medical reasons cannot usually be released without
                                    patient consent, and request for that information should be evaluated and answered
                                    only on a case-by-case basis. For example, it might be appropriate to tell a coach

                                    can be given about the visit(s) without patient consent (if consent is present in
                                    the Department of Athletics and Recreation, it should be faxed over before the information
                                    is released). Other requests for information about whether or not a student has been
                                    seen should be referred to the Student Health and Counseling Center Director, or the
                                    Director's representative, if patient consent is not available. No information about
                                    whether or not a student has been seen for mental health reasons should ever be given
                                    without specific patient consent, except to referring counselors/providers.

                                    or the Director's representative, must be consulted before such information is released
                                    when written patient consent is not available.

                                    emergency exists. These rare exceptions must be handled on a case-by-case basis and,
                                    whenever possible, be approved by the Student Health and Counseling Center Director
                                    or the Director's designated representative.

                                 you provide is typically encrypted by our server using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology.
                                 This encryption makes it difficult for a third party who would intercept the transaction
                                 to decipher it. If the web site address begins with https:// rather than http:// it
