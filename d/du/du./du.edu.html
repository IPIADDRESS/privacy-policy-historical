    <td width="518" valign="top"><h3> I. General Statement </h3>
      <p>PRIVACY is a word that conjures up strong convictions and an emotional
        reaction from many of us. In the modern world, however, wondrous forms
        of electronic communication render the protection of privacy interests
        much more difficult. We in the university community are not immune from
        the lure of convenience and speed when we utilize our information technology
        and electronic communication tools. It is, of course, part of our mission
        to share knowledge and to collaborate within our academic community.
        In doing so, however, we must recognize that these modern devices are
        never completely secure. It is a fact of life that all computer systems
        and communication systems are the subject of constant probing by outsiders
        ranging from the curious to the criminal. </p>
      <p>The University of Denver will
        endeavor to take reasonable precautions to maintain privacy and security
        within the sphere of operations. <strong><em> The
        University cannot guarantee that these efforts will always be successful
        and, therefore, users must assume the risk of a breach of University
        privacy and security systems. Individuals are advised to be discreet
        and cautious in their use of our systems.</em></strong> The University
        of Denver Privacy Guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified
        in the discretion of the University. These changes will be posted on
        this site.</p>
      <h3> II. Personal Information </h3>
      <p>The University of Denver recognizes and respects the importance of confidentiality
        and security of personal information in this increasingly open electronic
        age. The University does not intend to sell, swap, rent, or otherwise
        disclose for commercial purposes, outside the scope of ordinary University
        functions, your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address,
        or other information you provide. <strong><em> While the University makes
        reasonable efforts to protect information provided to us, we cannot guarantee
        that this information will remain secure and are not responsible for
        any loss or theft. </em></strong></p>
      <h3><strong><em> </em></strong>III. Use of University Equipment and Software </h3>
      <p>When an individual is connected to the University of Denver network
        or uses a University-owned computer, or other University-owned equipment,
        he/she agrees to abide by the rules and regulations of the University
        (see the University Acceptable Use Policy incorporated herein by this
        reference). While the University of Denver respects the desire and need
        for privacy in this setting, the University reserves the right, at all
        times, to search any and all hardware or software owned by the University,
        or connected to the University network, for the purposes of preventing
        or investigating improper or illegal use of University systems, or preventing
        or investigating system problems or efficiencies. In the course of an
        individual’s involvement with the University community, software
        or third party systems that are used may require the individual to divulge
        private or personal information. The University is not responsible for
        the content, use or privacy of this information.</p>
      <h3> IV. University Website(s) </h3>
      <p>When users visit the University of Denver website(s), the webmaster
        collects information concerning their Internet connection, which pages
        they visit on the site, the Internet Protocol Number (IP) from which
        they accessed du.edu, and other general information about their visit
        to the website. (Information associated with an individual IP Number
        may be used for internal diagnostics and investigation of misconduct
        or security issues.) The collection of this information is intended to
        help the University deliver efficient and useful service and it may be
        used to analyze trends, create summary statistics for determining technical
        design specifications, and to otherwise aid in monitoring system performance.
        Such information is stored on a temporary basis and the University will
        exercise reasonable care to release it only if legally mandated by law
        enforcement investigators, required by court proceedings, or it is deemed
        necessary to internal investigations of violations of University rules
        and regulations. The University does not intend to sell, swap, rent,
        or otherwise disclose for commercial purposes, information regarding
        the behavior, habits, or demographics of those who visit University controlled
        websites. Certain parts of the University website(s) may require tracking
        techniques to follow the user’s progress through courses, materials
        or programs or to verify information acquired from other sources. The
        University provides links to websites outside the du.edu network and
        is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of any website
        to which it may link. </p>
      <h3> V. E-Mail </h3>
      <p>The University does not intend to monitor the contents of e-mail sent
        to or from University servers, except to identify and correct problems
        with E-mail delivery or receipt, to work with email system problems,
        or to deal with misconduct or security issues. Electronic logs of who
        sends and receives e-mail through University servers are maintained for
        a short period of time. This information may be used to analyze trends,
        create summary statistics for internal planning purposes, and to otherwise
        aid in maintaining system performance and security. E-mail related information
        is stored on a temporary basis and may only be released if legally mandated
        by law enforcement investigators, required by court proceedings, or it
        is deemed necessary to internal investigations of violations of University
        rules and regulations. The names and e-mail addresses of University of
        Denver students, faculty, and staff are available in a searchable index.
        An individual may opt out of this index and have his/her name removed
        by contacting the Webmaster at <a href="mailto:webmaster@du.edu">webmaster@du.edu</a>.</p>
      <h3> VI. Questions About Our Online Privacy Policy </h3>

        online privacy policy, the practices of the University’s website,
        or use of the website, please contact the Webmaster’s office by
        e-mail at <a href="mailto:webmaster@mail.du.edu">webmaster@du.edu</a>,

      <h3> VII. Family Educational Rights and Privacy </h3>
      <p>The University is bound by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regarding the release of student education records and, in the event of conflict with the University Policy, FERPA will govern. A guide to understanding FERPA is available in the office of the Registrar. The full text of the University's policy with regard to FERPA can be found at <a href="http://www.du.edu/registrar/general/ferpa_student.html">http://www.du.edu/registrar/general/ferpa_student.html</a></p>
      <h3> VIII. Health Records/ Information </h3>
      <p>Users of the University Health and Counseling Center are protected under
        federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations
        and state of Colorado laws regarding confidentiality of medical and mental
        health information/records. The full text of the University Health and
        Counseling Center’s policy can be found in Appendix&nbsp;A immediately
        following this document.</p>
      <h3> IX. University Bookstore </h3>
      <p>The University Bookstore online privacy policy is, by reference here,
        incorporated in the University of Denver Privacy Policy. The full text
        of the Bookstore’s online privacy policy can be found in Appendix
        B immediately following this policy.</p>
      <h3> X. Release or Access </h3>
      <p>All requests for release of or access to confidential information maintained
        in the records of the University must be directed to the office of the
        University’s Legal Counsel. Disposition of such requests will be
        made by the University’s Legal Counsel in consultation with the
        appropriate custodian of the particular University record(s).<br>

      <h3 align="center"> UNIVERSITY OF DENVER <br>
        <strong>STUDENT HEALTH and </strong><strong> COUNSELING</strong><strong> CENTER</strong><strong>&nbsp;<br>
        </strong><strong>POLICY
        REGARDING CONFIDENTIALITY OF </strong><strong>MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH
        INFORMATION/RECORDS</strong></h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Unless otherwise required by law, confidentiality of any and all
          medical and mental health information about Student Health and
          Counseling Center patients, active and inactive, must be maintained
          at all times, except when a request is made for release of that information
          by appropriately executed written consent of the patient. In urgent
          situations, witnessed and properly documented verbal consent may be
          appropriate. </li>
        <li> In the case of patients less than 18 years of age, medical information
          may be released without consent to parents or legal guardians.
          However, medical information of a sensitive nature, i.e., information
          regarding sexually transmitted diseases, contraception, pregnancy,
          abortion, etc., <strong>may not</strong> be released without patient
          consent. Mental health information may not be released without specific
          consent. When a question exists as to whether or not medical or mental
          health information may be released to the parent or legal guardian,
          the Student Health and Counseling Center Director, or the Director’s
          representative, should be consulted before release of information occurs. </li>
        <li> “Medical and mental health information” includes all
          information present in the medical or mental health record, information
          given or received over the telephone, by facsimile, e-mail, or other
          forms of communication, and medical or mental health information
          acquired formally or informally by any means within and outside the
          Student Health and Counseling Center on a Student Health and Counseling
          Center patient. </li>
        <li> “Medical/mental health information” includes, but is
          not limited to, information about a patient’s physical or mental
          health condition, drug and alcohol use, and HIV status. </li>
        <li> Medical and mental health information may be released without documented
          patient consent to a provider treating a patient on an emergency basis. </li>
        <li>Information about whether or not a patient has been seen (“yes” or “no”)
          at the Student Health and Counseling Center for medical reasons cannot
          usually be released without patient consent, and request for that information
          should be evaluated and answered only on a case-by-case basis. For
          example, it might be appropriate to tell a coach or athletic trainer
          who has referred an athlete to the Student Health and Counseling Center
          for treatment whether or not the student has been seen. However, no
          other information can be given about the visit(s) without patient consent
          (if consent is present in the Department of Athletics and Recreation,
          it should be faxed over before the information is released). Other
          requests for information about whether or not a student has been seen
          should be referred to the Student Health and Counseling Center Director,
          or the Director’s representative, if patient consent is not
          available. <strong>No</strong> information
          about whether or not a student has been seen for <strong>mental health</strong> reasons
          should ever be given without specific patient consent, except to
          referring counselors/providers. </li>
        <li> Subpoenas for medical or mental health records, no matter how official
          in appearance, do not automatically trigger release of records.
          The Student Health and Counseling Center Director, or the Director’s
          representative, must be consulted before any release of medical
          or mental health records consequent to a subpoena. </li>
        <li> Requests for medical or mental health information about a patient
          from law enforcement officers, campus security officers, governmental
          agencies, etc., do not automatically allow release of that information.
          The Student Health and Counseling Center Director, or the Director’s
          representative, must be consulted before such information is released
          when written patient consent is not available. </li>
        <li> The release of information regarding MMR immunization status to
          the Registrar or other University officials is allowed without patient
          consent. </li>
        <li> Exceptions to the above policy/procedures may apply if a true medical
          or psychiatric emergency exists. These rare exceptions must be
          handled on a case-by-case basis and, whenever possible, be approved
          by the Student Health and Counseling Center Director or the Director’s
          designated representative. </li>
        <li>Whenever a request for release of medical or mental health information,
          written or verbal, generates questions about the appropriateness
          of that release and/or the situation is not addressed by the above
          policy/procedures, the Student Health and Counseling Center Director,
          or the Director’s
          representative, should be consulted before release of information occurs. </li>
        <li> Any release of medical or mental health information about a Student
          Health and Counseling Center patient or discussion of that information
          in any forum outside the Student Health and Counseling Center without
          proper authorization as described above constitutes a breach of
          confidentiality.</li>
        <li> Such breach of confidentiality by an employee is subject to serious
          disciplinary action by the University, up to and including immediate
          termination of employment. The University may also be subject to
          monetary fines under the law. </li>
        <li> The Student Health and Counseling Center follows all State of Colorado
          laws and federal HIPAA regulations governing the handling and release
          of medical and mental health information.</li>
      </ol>
      <p> For more information on State of Colorado health record laws, HIPAA
        regulations and your rights please contact the Student Health and Counseling
        Center :</p>

      <h3 align="center"><strong> University</strong><strong> of </strong><strong> Denver</strong><strong> Bookstore <br>
        </strong><strong>Website
        Privacy Policy </strong></h3>
      <h4> I. General </h4>
      <p>The University of Denver Bookstore has established this policy and is
        providing it to you so that you can understand the manner in which we
        use your information and the efforts we use to protect it. This policy
        works in conjunction with the overall University of Denver Privacy Policy.</p>
      <h4> II. Service Provider </h4>
      <p>The University of Denver Bookstore’s service provider is CampusHub.
        The University is not responsible for the content or privacy policies
        of CampusHub or any website to which it may link. </p>
      <h4> III. Personal Information </h4>
      <p>The University of Denver Bookstore is aware of and concerned about your
        interest in keeping your private information confidential. The University
        of Denver Bookstore will endeavor to take reasonable precautions to maintain
        privacy and security within the sphere of operations. We cannot guarantee
        that these efforts will always be successful and, therefore, users must
        assume the risk of a breach of University Bookstore privacy and security
        systems. Individuals are advised to be discreet and cautious in their
        use of our systems. </p>
      <h5> A. Your email Address </h5>
      <p>The University does not intend to sell, swap, rent, or otherwise disclose
        for commercial purposes your email address with third parties, unless
        required for system functionality or other fundamental usage requirements.
        The Bookstore does not intend to send you “junk” email or
        messages that do not relate to the purpose of your original communication
        with us. </p>
      <h5> B. Your Credit Card Information </h5>
      <p>The University of Denver Bookstore has undertaken procedures to provide
        security for our credit card transactions. While we endeavor to protect
        the security and validity of your transaction, we cannot guarantee that
        these efforts will always be successful and, therefore, user must assume
        the risk of a breach of our systems.</p>
      <h5> C. Other Personal Information </h5>
      <p>Personal information pertaining to your account can be accessed and
        changed whenever you sign into the University of Denver Bookstore site
        and go to your account. Categories of information kept in your account
        profile may include, but are not limited to, the following: name, daytime
        phone number and complete address. </p>
      <h5> D. Automatic Information and Supplemental Technologies </h5>
      <p>Please refer to the CampusHub independent privacy policy in regards
        to these specific topics [Online at <a href="http://www.thecampushub.com/html/privacy.html">http://www.thecampushub.com/html/privacy.html</a>].</p>
      <h4> IV. Security and Confidentiality </h4>
      <p>When you place an order with us using one of our security enhanced forms,
        the data you provide is typically encrypted by our server using SSL (Secure
        Socket Layer) technology. This encryption makes it difficult for a third
        party who would intercept the transaction to decipher it. If the web
        site address begins with https:// rather than http:// it has this security
        mechanism engaged. Security enhanced connections only protect the information
        as it is coming and going, not when it sits on the server. </p>
      <h4> V. Third Parties </h4>
      <p>The University does not intend to sell, swap, rent, or otherwise disclose
        for commercial purposes, information regarding the behavior, habits,
        or demographics of those who visit University controlled websites. Certain
        parts of the University website(s) may require tracking techniques to
        follow the user’s progress through courses, materials or programs
        or to verify information acquired from other sources. The University
        provides links to websites outside the du.edu network and is not responsible
        for the content or privacy policies of any website to which it may link. </p>
