    <br><p><b>3. Sharing your information
</b></p>

    <p>
        We do not rent, sell or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies
        except where we have your permission; or otherwise under the following circumstances:
    </p><ol type="a">
        <li>we may disclose your personal information to our suppliers, subcontractors and business partners ("<b>Service
            Providers</b>") who are involved in the provision, distribution, delivery and support of the Service, including
            the storage of any content available on the Service. They do so only under strict contractual arrangements
            that preserve the confidentiality and security of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy
            Policy;
        </li>
        <li>we may disclose your personal information to any law enforcement agency, court, regulator, government
            authority or other third party where we believe this is necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory
            obligation, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of any third party; and
        </li>
        <li>we may disclose your personal information in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which
            case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets or to
            any third party that purchases, or to which we transfer, all or substantially all of our assets and
            business. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the
            entity to which we transfer your personal information uses it in a manner that is consistent with this
            Privacy Policy.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>

    <br><p><b>4. Advertising</b></p>

    <p>
        4.1. We may deliver advertising to you in conjunction with your use of Service. If you receive any marketing

        <br>
        4.2. Where the Service contains links to third-party content, applications, services and/or advertising, we are
        not responsible for the privacy policy or for any matters relating to such third party products, promotions or

        products, promotions or advertising. We encourage you to check the privacy policies of all third party sites
        that you visit.<br>


    </p>

    <br><p><b>5. International Transfers</b></p>

    <p>
        As mentioned above, we may share the personal information you provide to us with our third party Service
        Providers for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Some of these Service Providers may be based in
        territories that are outside of the European Economic Area that are not governed by European data protection
        laws. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. However, where this
        is the case, we will put measures in place to ensure that your personal information is adequately protected in
        accordance with German standards.
    </p>

    <br><p><b>6. Security of Your Information</b></p>

    <p>
        6.1. We take the security of your personal information seriously and use appropriate technical and
        organisational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorised or unlawful processing and
        against accidental loss, destruction or damage. <br>
        <br>
        6.2. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will
        do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data which is transmitted to
        or from the Service. Any transmission is at your own risk.<br>
        <br>6.3. We keep your personal information for no longer than is necessary for our business purposes or for
        legal requirements.<br>
    </p>
