                          General: When users come to our Site, we collect  and aggregate information indicating their home server, but not their e-mail  addresses. Such information helps us identify the most popular content and  portions of our Site and determine the effectiveness of our various promotional  activities. We aggregate such information for internal review and thereafter it’s  superseded by more recent information. <br>
                          <br>
                          <em>Personally Identifiable Information</em> <br>

                          (a) General: In certain areas of this Site, we  require that you provide us with personally-identifiable information, in order  to be able to use that portion or those portions of this Site.

                          <em>How We Use The Information We Gather </em><br>
                          <br>
                          How We Use Non-Personally Identifiable Information:  We aggregate data on users' home servers for internal review purposes, in order  to build higher quality, more useful online services and better products, e.g.,  by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and  behavior of our users. Following such internal review, such aggregated  information is then superseded by more recent information. <br>
                          <br>
                          How We Use Personally-Identifiable Information: DubTurbo.com provides notice to  users that personally-identifiable (i.e., non-aggregated) information will be  collected during the Web-browsing process; this Privacy Policy also serves as  notice that such information is collected under those circumstances. DubTurbo.com  may use such information to enhance your experience by providing such  information to appropriate third parties, including any outsourcers, as  reviewed and selected by DubTurbo.com . <br>
                          <br>
                          DubTurbo.com reserves the right to disclose information contained in our access  logs concerning any user as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our  systems or business. In particular, we reserve the right to disclose such when  a user is in violation of our current or later Terms of Service or other  published guidelines, or initiates or participates (or is reasonably believed  so) in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court  order, and to disclose such information in response to court and governmental  orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests, and as otherwise required by law. <br>
                          <br>
                          In reviewing the information above, please keep in  mind that DubTurbo.com cannot and does not assume any responsibility for any  actions or omissions of third parties, including other Site users, including  the manner in which they might use information received either from DubTurbo.com  or independently.</span></p>
