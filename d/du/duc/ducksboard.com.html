<p>The cookies enable recognition of the users only when they have been registered so that they do not have to register each time they visit or access areas or services that are reserved exclusively for them. They also provide information on the date and time of the last visit the user made to the website and the content selected in browsing.</p>
<h4>3. Log files, IP addresses and information about your computer</h4>
<p>Due to the communications standards on the internet, when you visit the Few Ducks Website we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave Few Ducks. Few Ducks also receives the internet protocol (“IP”) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, mobile device operating system (if you are accessing Few Ducks using a mobile device), as well as the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. We use this information to analyze overall trends to help improve the service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties without your permission.</p>
<h4>4. Analytics</h4>
<p>Similarly, this Website uses Google Analytics, an analytical Web service provided by Google, Inc., a Delaware company with registered offices at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View (California), CA 94043, USA (“hereinafter Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files installed on your computer to help the website analyze the use that you make of the website. The information generated by the cookies about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be directly transmitted to and filed by Google in servers in the United States. Google has declared it will use this information on our behalf in order to monitor your use of the website, compiling website activity reports and offering other services related with the activity of the website and use of the Internet.

<h4>8. Few Ducks as data processor</h4>
<p>In submitting any third party personal data within the context of the Services (“Third Party Data”), the parties agree that User shall be the Data Controller and Users appoint Few Ducks as a Data Processor of such data, for the purpose of providing the Services. To the extent that Few Ducks is a “Data Processor” for the Users in respect of such Third Party Data, Few Ducks shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard the Third Party Data against any unauthorized or unlawful access, loss, destruction, theft, use or disclosure. Few Ducks implements basic level security in accordance with Spanish RD 1720/2007. If higher levels of security are required, please contact us. User warrants to and instructs Few Ducks that unless expressly indicated in writing, basic level security measures are legally sufficient for the protection of such third party personal data.</li>
<li>Limit access to the Third Party Data only to those employees who need to know it to enable the Processor to perform the Services, and shall take appropriate steps to ensure the reliability of those of its employees or subcontractors who have access to such Third Party Data.</li>
<li>Only process the personal data as specified by this Agreement and in accordance with the instructions of the User, and will not use the Third Party Data for any purposes other than those related to the performance of the Services or pursuant to the written instructions of the User.</li>
<li>Upon the expiry or termination of this Agreement, or upon request of the registered User, cease any and all use of the Third Party Data and will destroy or return it to the User.</li>
<li>Not disclose the Third Party Data to any third party without the prior written consent of the User. Such consent is granted on, for example, the User’s instruction to share a Ducksboard with third parties (public or within a restricted group).</li>
</ul>
<p>Few Ducks as Data Processor may provide access to a subcontractor processor to any such Third Party Data if it reasonably considers such access and processing necessary to the performance of the Services. In the event of such access and before the access takes place, Few Ducks shall ensure that an agreement with the third party is in place which is sufficient to require it to treat personal data in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement and applicable law. In particular, Users authorise Few Ducks to subcontract the provision of technology and commercial services to members of its corporate group, as well as (but without limitation) Linode LCC, member of the US Safe Harbor program for the protection of personal data.</p>
<p>Data Processor shall provide Users with reasonable assistance in the event that the Customer receives a request from an individual or regulator under the data protection laws, provided that Users shall first use all reasonable endeavours to resolve the request without the assistance of Few Ducks and Few Ducks shall promptly notify Users of any such request received by Few Ducks that should properly have been addressed to the Users.</p>
<p>User warrants that it has all the appropriate consents from data subjects whose personal data are submitted to Few Ducks in the course of the provision of the Services. User will indemnify and keep Few Ducks harmless from all claims, damages and losses it may suffer relating to or arising out of the processing of third party personal data submitted to Few Ducks systems during the course of the provision of the Services.</p>
