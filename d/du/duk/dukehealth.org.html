For each category of uses or disclosures, we will explain what we mean and try to give some examples. Not every use or disclosure in a category will be listed. However, all of the ways we are permitted to use and disclose information will fall within at least one of the categories.</p>
<p><strong>For Treatment. </strong>We may use your health information to provide, coordinate or manage your healthcare treatment and related services. This may include communication with other health-c are providers regarding your treatment and coordinating and managing your healthcare with others. For ex ample, a doctor treating you for a broken leg may need to know if you have diabetes because diabetes may slow the healing process. The doctor may need to tell the dietitian if you have diabetes so that we can arrange for appropriate meals. Different DHE departments may also access your health information in order to coordinate the different things you need, such as prescriptions, lab work and x-rays. We ma y also disclose your health information to people, such as ho me health providers, who may be involved in your medical care after you leave our care</p>
<p><strong>For Payment. </strong>We may use and disclose your health information to other providers so they may bill and collect payment for treatment and services they provided to you. Before you receive scheduled services, we may share information about these services with your health plan(s) to obtain prior approval or to determine whether your insurance will cover the treatment. We may also share your health information with billing and collection departments or agencies, insurance companies and health plans to collect payment for services, departments that review the appropriateness of the care provided and the costs associated with that care and to consumer reporting agencies (e.g., credit bureaus). For example, if you have a broken leg, we may need to give your health plan(s) information about your condition, supplies used (medications or crutches) and services you received (X-rays or surgery). This information is given to our billing agency and your health plan so we can be paid or you can be reimbursed</p>
<p><strong>For Health Care Operations. </strong>We may use and disclose your health information for healthcare operations. These uses and disclosures allow us to improve the quality of care we provide and reduce healthcare costs. Examples of uses and disclosures for healthcare operations include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Reviewing and improving the quality, efficiency and cost of care that we provide to you and other patients.</li>
<li>Evaluating the skills, qualifications, and performance of healthcare providers taking care of you.</li>
<li>Providing training programs for students, trainees, healthcare providers or non-healthcare professionals (for example, billing clerks) to help them practice or improve their skills.</li>
<li>Cooperating with outside organizations that assess the quality of care we provide. These organizations might include government agencies or accrediting bodies like the Joint Commission and the Accreditation Association of Ambulatory Healthcare, Inc.</li>
<li>Cooperating with outside organizations that evaluate, certify or license healthcare providers, staff or facilities in a particular field or specialty. For example, we may use or disclose health information so that one of our nurses may become certified in a specific field of nursing.</li>
<li>Sharing information with the Duke University Police Department to maintain safety at our facilities.</li>
<li>Assisting various people who review our activities. Health information may be seen by doctors reviewing services provided to you, and by accountants, lawyers and others who assist us in complying with applicable laws.</li>
<li>Conducting business management and general administrative activities related to our organizations and services we provide.</li>
<li>Resolving grievances within our organizations.</li>
<li>Complying with this Notice and with applicable laws.</li>

<p><strong>Treatment Alternatives.</strong> We may use and disclose your health information to manage and coordinate your healthcare and inform you of treatment alternatives and other health related benefits that may be of interest to you. This may include telling you ab out treatments, services, products and/or other healthcare providers. For example, if you are diagnosed with diabetes, we may tell you about nutritional and other counseling services that may be of interest to you</p>
<p><strong>Business Associates.</strong> There are some services provided in our organization through contracts with business associates. For example, we may use a copy service to make copies of your medical record. When we hire companies to perform these services, we may disclose your health information to these companies so that they can perform the job we’ve asked them to do. To protect your health information, however, we require the business associate to appropriately safeguard your health information.</p>
<p><strong>Fund-raising Activities.</strong> We may use your health information to contact you or your legal representative in an effort to raise money for DHE and its operations. We would only use contact information, such as your name, address and phone number, department of service, treating physician, outcome information, health insurance status, and the dates you received treatment or services. You have the right to opt out of receiving these communications. If you do not want us to contact you for fundraising efforts, please call 1-800-688-1867 or send your written request to:</p>

<p><strong>Hospital Directory.</strong> We may include certain limited information about you in the hospital directory while you are a patient at one of our hospitals. This information may include your name, location in the hospital, your general condition (e.g., fair, stable, etc.) and your religious affiliation.

We may tell your family or friends you condition. In addition, we may disclose health information about you to an entity assisting in a disaster relief effort so that your family can be notified about your condition and location. If you do not want health information about you released to those involved in your care, please call 1-800-688-1867. We will comply with additional state law confidentiality protections if you are a minor and receive treatment for pregnancy, drug and/or alcohol abuse, venereal disease or emotional disturbances.</p>

    Other uses of health information  </h2>

  <div class="field field-name-field-overview-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden">

<ul><li>Psychotherapy notes made by your individual mental health provider during a counseling session, except for certain limited purposes related to treatment, payment and health care operations, or other limited exceptions, including government oversight and safety.</li>
<li>Certain marketing activities, including if we are paid by a third party for marketing statements as described in your executed authorization.</li>

</ul><p>If you provide us permission to use or disclose your health information, you may revoke that permission, in writing, at any time.

<p><strong>North Carolina Law.</strong> In the event that North Carolina Law requires us to give more protection to your health information than stated in this notice or require d by federal law, we will give that additional protection to your health information. We will comply with additional state law confidentiality protections relating to treatment for mental health and drug or alcohol abuse. Unless you object in writing, we may release health information related to your mental health to any health care provider involved in your care, to third party payers for payment or to others for quality improvement activities. Also, state law permits a hospice, home health, ambulatory surgery or outpatient cardiac rehabilitation patient to object in writing to having state licensing inspectors review their health information during a licensure survey, and we will comply with such written objection. If you apply for and receive substance abuse services from us, federal law generally requires that we obtain your written consent before we may disclose information that would identify you as a substance abuser or a patient for substance abuse services. There are exceptions to this general requirement. For instance, we may disclose information to our workforce as needed to coordinate your care, to agencies or individuals who help us carry out our responsibilities in serving you, and to health care providers in an emergency.</p>
