<p><strong>The Information We Collect </strong><br>We do not collect personal information about you through our Web sites or mobile Web site unless you voluntarily provide it. We may collect personal information when you create or modify your online account, respond to surveys, contact us via the Web or mobile device, or complete any self-service transaction with us online. &nbsp;For example, if you choose to use online or mobile customer services, including account access, e-bill and product or service enrollment, you will be asked to provide personal information.</p>
<p>At any time, you may opt out of providing such personal information by simply not providing it or by discontinuing your use of our Web site or mobile Web site.

If you choose not to provide this information, we may not be able to provide you with the requested service or complete your transaction.)</p>

<p><strong>Appended Information</strong><strong> </strong><br>During the Start Service process, Duke Energy supplements/appends the information you provide with additional data received from third party sources. This supplemental information helps us to verify, update and correct the information our customers provide as well as help us determine if a deposit will be needed in order to provide you with services.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic Collection of Information</strong><br>We receive and store certain types of information when you interact with our website, mobile Web site, e-mails, and online advertising to monitor proper functionality, determine areas for continuous improvement, and to support website analytics and marketing campaigns. We collect information such as the number of visits to our site and mobile Web site, mobile device identifier and operating system, the amount of time visitors spend on the site and mobile Web site, the number of pages viewed and the domains from which visitors visit the site.&nbsp; This information is gathered automatically and we store it in log files.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Examples include Internet protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring websites, exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data meaning the path you take to navigate through our Web pages.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To collect this information, we use tracking technologies like cookies and clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs). These technologies may be invisible to you, and we analyze the information collected only in the aggregate; it is not associated with any specific individuals. We use these tracking technologies at the point of collection of your personal information, not in e-mails that you receive from us. We also use a third-party tracking service that uses these technologies to track non-personal information about visitors to our site.&nbsp; This information is collected in the aggregate and is used to track usage and volume statistics.</p>
<p>We use "cookies" to recognize you as you use or return to our website or mobile Web site. This is done so that we can provide a continuous and more personalized experience for you. A cookie is a small text file that a website or e-mail may save to your browser and store on your hard drive.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use the Information We Collect </strong><br>We use your information to provide requested services and to support our business functions. For example, we may use your information to:</p>
<ul>

<li>Alert you to updated information and services </li>
<li>Protect the security or integrity of our websites, mobile Web site and our business </li>
<li>Answer your questions</li></ul>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.&nbsp; If you wish to cancel your account, or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, please review the "Access" section below.</p>
<p><strong>Information Sharing</strong><strong> </strong><br>Duke Energy does not sell, rent or lease your personal information, nor does Duke Energy share such information with third parties for the purpose of sending you advertisements for products or services unaffiliated with Duke Energy, its affiliates or business partners, without your consent. </p>
<p>Absent your consent, Duke Energy may, however, share personal information you provide to us for legitimate business purposes, including, without limitation, the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Transferring such information to Duke Energy's affiliates and subsidiaries, unless such transfer is prohibited by law </li>
<li>Transferring such information as part of a merger, consolidation, acquisition, divestiture or other corporate restructuring (including bankruptcy). &nbsp;If such an activity occurs, we will provide notice as described below in "Changes to our Privacy Policy". </li>
<li>Making such information available to third parties who are providing the product, service or information that you have requested (but never your password) </li>
<li>Making such information available to third parties who are&nbsp;service providers to Duke Energy or its subsidiaries or affiliates (e.g., third parties performing computer-related services, credit card processing, e-mail service providers, map service provider, employment services, sweepstakes administrators, credit reporting agencies, electronic bill payment services, or debt collection purposes (in the event of account default) for Duke Energy or its affiliates (but never your password)) </li>
<li>We form a good-faith belief that disclosure of such information is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding any illegal activities or regarding interference with the operation of our site or violation of its terms of use</li></ol>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose any and all pertinent information about you in our possession if we are required to do so by federal or state law, subpoena or court order, or as we, in good faith, believe is legally necessary.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We do not retain this information.</p>
<p>Widgets, such as the "Share" feature, support functions that require that you disclose certain personal information given your choice of participation. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and&nbsp;may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>We also post testimonials on our site from customers who have given approval to post their personal information along with their testimonial. </p>
<p><strong>Aggregate Information</strong><br>Duke Energy reserves the right to share any aggregate and statistical information (i.e., non-personal information) with any third parties for any reason, unless prohibited by law.</p>
<p><strong>Consent</strong><br>By providing personal information, you expressly consent to these privacy practices. We may also supplement your information with additional information we receive from a credit check performed when you apply for certain services. </p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Requirements</strong><br>Some state statutes, and certain state utility commissions with regulatory oversight of our Duke Energy utility service territories, require that certain customer information be protected from disclosure to our Duke Energy affiliate companies.</p>
