At any time, you may opt out of providing such personal information by simply not providing it or by discontinuing your use of the Duke Energy website. (Please note:&nbsp; Even if you choose not to have an online account with us, we will still store some of your personal information in our billing system if you are a Duke Energy customer.)</p>
<p>Examples of information (personal, demographic or other) that you may provide to us while using our site include:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>Email address/es </li>

<p>If you want to customize some areas within our site, or if you ask detailed questions or request information to meet your specific needs, you may need to supply additional information.

<h4>Automatic Collection of Information</h4>
<p>To improve our website, we collect information on the number of visits to our site, the amount of time visitors spend on the site, the number of pages viewed and the domains from which visitors visit the site.&nbsp;This information is gathered automatically, and we store it in log files.&nbsp;Examples include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To collect this information, we use tracking technologies like cookies and clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs).&nbsp; These technologies may be invisible to you, and we analyze the information collected only in the aggregate; it is not associated with any specific individuals.</p>
<p>We use these tracking technologies at the point of collection of your personal information, not in emails that you receive from us.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We also use a third-party tracking service that uses these technologies to track nonpersonal information about visitors to our site.&nbsp;This information is collected in the aggregate, and is used to track usage and volume statistics.</p>
<h4>How We Use the Information We Collect </h4>
<p>We use the information you voluntarily provide to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fulfill your request </li>

<h4>Communications from Us</h4>
<p>You will receive email communications from us when you sign up for an account online, perform an online transaction (such as paying your bill, requesting a new password, etc.) or opt in to receive marketing emails from us. If you have opted to receive marketing emails, we may contact you via email about new products and services.&nbsp;To opt out of receiving these marketing e-mails, please log into your online account and edit your profile. &nbsp;<br><br>In some instances, Duke Energy will co-brand with another company. Please be aware that the privacy policy referenced at the bottom of the Web page governs the collection of information on that page. </p>
<h4>Information Sharing</h4>
<p>Duke Energy does not sell the personal information or email addresses you provide, nor does Duke Energy share such information with third parties for the purpose of sending you advertisements for products or services unaffiliated with Duke Energy, its affiliates or business partners. &nbsp;Duke Energy may, however, share personal information or email addresses that you provide to us for legitimate business purposes, including, without limitation, the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Transferring such information to Duke Energy's affiliates and subsidiaries, unless such transfer is prohibited by law </li>
<li>Transferring such information as part of a merger, consolidation, acquisition, divestiture or other corporate restructuring (including bankruptcy). If such an activity occurs, we will provide notice as described below in "Changes to our Privacy Policy." </li>
<li>Making such information available (but never your password) to third parties who are providing the product, service or information that you have requested </li>
<li>Making such information available (but never your password) to third parties who provide services to Duke Energy or its subsidiaries or affiliates (e.g., third parties performing computer-related services, credit card processing, e-mail services, &nbsp;sweepstakes administration or electronic bill payment services </li>
<li>We form a good-faith belief that disclosure of such information is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding any illegal activities or regarding interference with the operation of our website or violation of its terms of use </li>
<li>Disclosing such information is allowed by law, or our legal counsel forms a good-faith belief that such disclosure is required by federal or state law, subpoena or court order </li>
<li>Information may be shared with a third party for debt collection purposes in the event of account default.</li></ol>
<p>By providing personal information or email addresses, you expressly consent to these privacy practices. We may also supplement your information with additional information we receive from a credit check performed when you apply for certain services. </p>
<p>Some state statutes, and certain state utility commissions with regulatory oversight of our Duke Energy utility service territories, require that certain customer information be protected from disclosure to our Duke Energy affiliate companies.</p>
<p>The statutes or applicable codes of conduct may be found here:</p>

<p>We also post testimonials on our site from customers who have given approval to post their personal information along with their testimonial. </p>
<p>Duke Energy reserves the right to share any aggregated information (i.e., non-personal information) with any third parties for any reason, unless prohibited by law.</p>
<h4>Security </h4>
<p>Duke Energy uses industry-standard practices to protect your personal information and email address from loss, misuse, alteration and destruction.

<h4>Links to Non-Duke Energy Sites </h4>
<p>For the convenience of our users, some pages of our website offer you the ability to link to and view pages of websites not operated or controlled by Duke Energy (such as weather and financial information). Often, but not always, you can tell that you have linked to a non-Duke Energy website because a separate browser window will open. Links by Duke Energy to such external websites do not imply endorsement by Duke Energy of that company, its site or its privacy policy. Duke Energy and its affiliates do not monitor or control the content or the privacy policies of those external sites, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of linked external websites. When using a link to a non-Duke Energy website, we recommend that you investigate the privacy practices and policies of such external site.</p>
<h4>Changes to Our Privacy Policy </h4>
<p>Duke Energy reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy and its email practices at any time. If we decide to make material changes to our policy regarding privacy and/or email practices, we will notify you here and on our home page prior to the changes taking effect, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. You may want to visit this website periodically to review the current Privacy Policy. Use of our website after the posting of a revised privacy policy constitutes your agreement with the revised policy. This Privacy Policy is not intended to and does not create any contractual or legal rights in or on behalf of any party. </p>
