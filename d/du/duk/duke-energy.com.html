<p>If you want to customize some areas within our site, or if you ask detailed questions or request information to meet your specific needs, you may need to supply additional information. &nbsp;This may include identifying topics of interest, supplying your title and function for business users, providing a home/office address, or filling out account information for billing questions.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic Collection of Information</strong><br>To improve our Web site, we collect information on the number of visits to our site, the amount of time visitors spend on the site, the number of pages viewed and the domains from which visitors visit the site.&nbsp; This information is gathered automatically and we store it in log files.&nbsp; Examples include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We use these tracking technologies at the point of collection of your personal information, not in e-mails that you receive from us.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We also use a third-party tracking service that uses these technologies to track nonpersonal information about visitors to our site.&nbsp; This information is collected in the aggregate and is used to track usage and volume statistics.</p>

<h4>Information Sharing</h4>
<p>Duke Energy does not sell the personal information or e-mail addresses you provide, nor does Duke Energy share such information with third parties for the purpose of sending you advertisements for products or services unaffiliated with Duke Energy or with its affiliates or business partners. &nbsp;Duke Energy may, however, share personal information or e-mail addresses that you provide to us for legitimate business purposes, including, without limitation, the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Transferring such information to Duke Energy’s affiliates and subsidiaries, unless such transfer is prohibited by law </li>

<p>By providing personal information or e-mail addresses, you expressly consent to these privacy practices. We may also supplement your information with additional information we receive from a credit check performed when you apply for certain services. </p>

<p>We also post testimonials on our site from customers who have given approval to post their personal information along with their testimonial. </p>
<p>Duke Energy reserves the right to share any aggregated information (i.e., non-personal information) with any third parties for any reason, unless prohibited by law.</p>
<h4>Security </h4>
<p>Duke Energy uses industry-standard practices to protect your personal information and e-mail address from loss, misuse, alteration and destruction. &nbsp;Such measures include firewalls and Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) to encrypt and protect certain sensitive transmissions of information. &nbsp;However, no security system is fail-safe, and Duke Energy cannot guarantee the information you provide will never be obtained by unauthorized persons. &nbsp;The yellow lock at the bottom right-hand corner of a Web page indicates that a user is on a secured site. &nbsp;In some areas of our Web site, we require a user ID and password for you to access certain information. &nbsp;Duke Energy will not intentionally disclose any such password to third parties; however, you are responsible for maintaining the privacy and security of your password.</p>
