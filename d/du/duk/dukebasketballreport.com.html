	textContent["1"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"I like the game now, but I don't like the game as much. I have never cared for the showmanship, and I think there is too much showmanship in the game today. While I think the players today are just unbelievable - their athleticism - I don't think team play is as good as it used to be.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">John Wooden</span>";
	textContent["2"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"Go Duke! (go t'hell, carolina, go t'hell!!) geez.....78yrs old, and still doin' it...\" </span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">DBR Reader Sid Einbinder</span> ";
	textContent["3"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"Every March.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Kobe Bryant, when asked if he regrets not playing college ball.</span>";
	textContent["4"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"Letting them shoot 20 free throws in the second half is not what we want to do. You've got to win some games like this that are a little uglier than you like, but we've got a pretty dog-gone good basketball team that took a good shot from a good team and still got a win.\" </span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Roy Williams, after defeating Nevada</span> ";
	textContent["5"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"I came here because of the basketball. The academic side is nice and it’s extra, a $40,000 extra. But I’m here for the basketball.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Duke tenter Weston Ijames</span>";
	textContent["6"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"We weren't one of those families that were really close, but the game was always a constant in my life. My parents got divorced, but you could always go shoot a basketball if things weren't going well. The great thing about basketball is, if you have a ball and a rim, you can go play and you don't need anybody else around.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Gary Williams</span>";
	textContent["7"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">Yes, it was... and more (the experience being everything he expected or hoped for). Some of the guys were telling me that the teams they kind of had in the past there was never this kind of bond or close relationship. We really have a good time with one another, joking around, and we enjoy each other's company, you know, one through twelve. When you have that it makes the experience much more enjoyable. We push each other all the time, all the time. That's something that doesn't stop. Whether it's halftime, before the game, whatever, we push each other to be the best.</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Kobe Bryant on the national team </span>";
	textContent["8"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"I think what you saw out of him is what we have been seeing all preseason.  He's a low-post player that goes block to block, rebounds the ball and he tries to dunk everything. ... Some of those big kids come out and think they are 3-point shooters. He knows who he is and that's encouraging.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Dino Gaudio on freshman Tony Woods</span>";
	textContent["9"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"It's time for me to become a better person. A better guy. A better person on and off the court. I really got to balance my energy on the court. You know, show my energy in a better way. People sometimes get it wrong about me when they haven't even talked to me. I have a lot of things to prove. I am looking forward to that. I think it's going to be a fun year for me as well as the whole team.\" </span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Maryland's Grievis Vasquez</span>";
	textContent["10"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"We've lost three games now and we've got the meat of our schedule coming up in a very tough conference.  Our backs are to the wall and we've got to come out fighting.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Quin Snyder, on coaching in the D-League</span>";
	textContent["11"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"The thing that I've learned just throughout life - not just through basketball, not through Duke - is that there's jealousy. There's jealousy, and jealousy leads to resentment. And I think that's what you have with the Duke basketball program.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Jeff Capel on Duke hating</span> ";
	textContent["12"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"It alwaysseemed like an injury would come up or something like that. My practice jersey,I hung it up in my room and just stared at it last night.\" </span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Kobe Bryant, excited about being able to play for the national team.</span> ";
	textContent["13"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"Years ago people thought our games against Duke and North Carolina would be insignificant. Who thought we would be playing Duke and North Carolina on ABC and ESPN the last week of the season? We don't make those matchups. TV does. Obviously someone thinks something exciting is going on here. \"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Seth Greenberg</span>";
	textContent["14"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"What they decided to do was to be the best offensive team in the country. Their mind-set never changes. They could be down 18 points at Miami or up 20 against St. John's. and they play the same way mentally. It's harder against them. Even if you make three or four stops in a row, the fifth is tough. That's why they're successful. They play that same aggressive offense.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Dave Leitao on Duke</span>";
	textContent["15"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"Every March.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Kobe Bryant, when asked if he regrets not playing college ball.</span>";
	textContent["16"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"Sometimes being here at Duke, because we've been very, very successful ...... they expect you to be perfect. They don't look at process anymore.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Coach K</span>";
	textContent["17"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"I came here because of the basketball. The academic side is nice and it’s extra, a $40,000 extra. But I’m here for the basketball.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Duke tenter Weston Ijames</span>";
	textContent["18"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"The best thing that I have learned is how the guys oversee their egos and individual achievements to become a team. We all know that a player like Kobe Bryant leads the league with scoring points every year, and he threw that out the window and deferred to Carmelo Anthony. I think that a lot of guys on our team threw their egos out the window and came here for one reason and that was to qualify for the Olympics and win a gold medal, and we were able to do that.  We've really grown close, on and off the court.  Everyone gets along.  Everyone sacrifices.  This is the best team I've ever played on.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">LeBron James on the national team </span>";
	textContent["19"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"If my son's life was on the line with one basketball game, I'd want him coaching. But I don't know that I'd want Noah ever playing for him.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Mike Gminski on Larry Brown</span> ";
	textContent["20"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"Nobody cares about this league, man. Eat your chicken nuggets.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Terence Todd to Byron Mouton, discussing the new ABA</span>";

<h3 class="pageTitleHeadlines">Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>
DukeBasketballReport.com (DBR) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting our website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. 
This Privacy Policy covers DBR's treatment of personal information that DBR gathers when you are on the DBR website and when you use DBR services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that DBR does not own or control, or to individuals that DBR does not employ or manage. 
</p> 
<h4>Information Collected by DBR</h4>
<p>
We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with this objective. We collect the following types of information from our DBR users: 
</p>
<p>
1. Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. 
</p>
<p>
2. Automatic Information:
</p>
<ul>
<li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. DBR and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, DBR cookie information, and the page you requested. DBR uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.</li>  
<li>DBR may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed. </li> 
<li>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While DBR will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.</li> 
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4>E-mail Communications</h4>
<p>
DBR is very concerned about your privacy and we will never provide your email address to a third party without your explicit permission, as detailed in the "Sharing Your Information" section below. DBR may send out e-mails with DBR-related news, products, offers, surveys or promotions. 
</p> 
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. DBR cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.</li>  
<li>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use some of DBR's coolest features.</li>  
<li>DBR's advertising partners may place a cookie on your browser that makes it possible to collect anonymous non-personally identifiable information that ad delivery systems use to present more relevant ads.  If you would prefer to opt-out of this standard practice, please visit our advertising partner Platform-A's privacy policy and opt-out page.</li>

<li>DBR Personnel: DBR personnel and authorized consultants and/or contractors may have access to user information if necessary in the normal course of DBR business. 
</li><li>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if DBR, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred. </li> 
<li>Protection of DBR and Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of DBR, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>  
<li>Syndication: DBR allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public content within the DBR website. </li> 
<li>With Your Consent: Except as noted above, we will contact you when your personal information is shared with third parties or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, and you will be able to opt out to prevent the sharing of this information.</li> 
</ul>
<p></p>
