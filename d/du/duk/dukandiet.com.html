Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our Site.</p><p>&nbsp;<b>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally Identifiable Information:</b> This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this Site, such as registering for diet coaching services, or ordering products, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums or other public areas, entering a contest or sweepstakes, filling out a survey, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form.</p><p>It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities; however, we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), e-mail address, telephone and facsimile numbers, birth date (primarily for eligibility purposes) and billing and payment information and other personally identifying information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.&nbsp; Unless you give us permission to do so, we will not sell, share, license, trade or rent your Personally Identifiable Information other than as specified in this Privacy Policy</p><p><b>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</b> This refers to information that does not by itself identify or contact a specific individual. We gather certain information about you when you subscribe to one of our diet coaching programs, or purchase our products. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis.</p><p>This information may include demographic information (like age, profession or gender) and health information (such as your current and desired weight).</p><p>&nbsp;Non-Personally Identifiable Information may also include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator (âURLâ) that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and/or your Internet Protocol (âIPâ) address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (âTCP/IPâ) network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.</p><p><b>&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information from other sources</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also supplement the information we collect with information from other sources to assist us in evaluating and improving our Site, to determine your preferences so that we can tailor our Site to your needs.</p><table class=" object-left" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="0%">
