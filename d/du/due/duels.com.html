		<p>At Oxygen  Games, Inc. (“Oxygen”) we share your concerns about privacy while using our  website, www.duels.com (the "Site” or “Duels”). Accordingly we want you to  understand what types of information we are collecting and what may happen to that  information. &nbsp;This Privacy Policy details  how we safeguard the privacy of our on-line users and does not apply to  information that may be collected by us off-line. This Privacy Policy is  incorporated into and is subject to the Duels Terms of Use. Your use of Duels  and any personal information you provide through Duels remains subject to the  terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p>
		<p class="greyText">WHAT YOU WILL FIND IN THIS PRIVACY  POLICY</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How  we collect information about you</li>
			<li>How  we use or share information about you</li>
			<li>How  we safeguard information about you </li>
			<li>Other  matters related to the information we collect about you</li>
		</ul>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="greyText">COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</p>
		<p>Information  is collected from our users at several different points during your use of  Duels.&nbsp; In general, information is  collected in connection with the purchase of goods or services though our  on-line stores, surveys, newsletters, user registrations for products,  services, warranties, contests or for on-line game participation, message  boards, and complaints or third party communications we may receive regarding our  users.</p>
		<p>Registration.  To use some resources available through Duels, a user must complete our  registration process. During registration, a user is required to provide  certain categories of information, which may include a name, address, e-mail  address, and a password.</p>
		<p>Optional  Information. At various other points during your use of Duels, you may be asked  to provide information about yourself. For example, you may wish to participate  in a survey or a contest. Participation in surveys or contests or the use of  other services which require the input of additional information is completely  voluntary on your part, and you have the choice about whether to disclose the  information necessary to use these features of our site.&nbsp; Users purchasing products or services through  our on-line stores will be required to provide additional information such as a  valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing addresses.</p>
		<p>Passive  Collection of Information. In addition to the information which you actively  provide to us by methods such as completing the registration form, we collect  information about how you interact with Duels. We collect passive information  for purposes such as testing and improving a user's experience with Duels and  the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage  information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as  advertisers and content partners. The types of passive information collected by  this site include, without limitation, your IP address, which type of browser  you are using, where you go within Duels and your behavior within Duels. </p>
		<p>Cookies.  When you visit the Site, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file  containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely  identifies your browser. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A  persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may  be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies  can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session  cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset  your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being  sent. However, some features of the Site may not function properly if the  ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
		<p>Collection  of Information from Children. Oxygen abides by federal law and the guidelines  set up by the Federal Trade Commission regarding youth privacy (Children's  Online Privacy Protection Act). As such, we will not knowingly collect any  personal information from or allow the registration of young people under the  age of 13.</p>
		<p class="greyText">USE / SHARING OF INFORMATION </p>
		<p>We may use  your information in order to deliver products and services to you and to customize  Duels to your interests and enhance your overall experience with Duels. We try  to recognize you using various methods, including having you log in with your  user name and your password. Once we recognize you advertisements and other  content may be customized for you so that you can see what interests you the  most. In addition, as described above, we utilize passive information to learn  more about how you interact with Duels. This passive information may be  combined with your other information for purposes such as testing and improving  your experience at our site and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic  data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to  third parties such as advertisers and content partners. This aggregate passive  information does not contain any personal information which can identify any  individual user. </p>

This aggregate information does not contain any personal information  which can identify any individual user. </p>
		<p>From time to  time, we may decide that it is more efficient to use third parties to perform  specific services, such as sending communications to our users.

These third party service providers are only allowed to use  personally identifiable information for the purpose of providing the specific  services requested by us. The third party services covered by this paragraph do  not include links to third party sites found on our site, which are governed by  a more specific provision below.</p>
