LAST UPDATED: 01/02/2007</p><p>

Protecting the privacy of all of our users (�Users�, �you� or �your�) is a dedicated commitment of Dumpalink.com and all of the services brought to you by Dumpalink.com (collectively, "Dumpalink", �us� or �we�). This Privacy Policy (�Privacy Policy�), applies to all URLs and services provided under the Dumpalink name and in connection with the Dumpalink marks.  It explains how Dumpalink treats personal information that we collect and receive on the Dumpalink website from our users and visitors. </p><p>

Personal information is information about you that is not otherwise available to the public.  As the words imply, this information personally identifies you. Personal information may include, but is not limited to, your name, location, e-mail address, birth date, or other identifying information. </p><p>

You should be aware that this Privacy Policy applies ONLY to the Dumpalink website, the Dumpalink URLs, and the services and features provided by Dumpalink.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites that you visit before or after us, to the other third party services featured on the Dumpalink site, or to third party advertisers or affiliates (collectively, �Third Party Services�).  Please be sure to familiarize yourself with all of these Third Party Services� privacy policies.  For your convenience ONLY, we have listed links to third party privacy policies for some of the parties that we do business with. However, not all Third Party Services may be listed. </p><p>

Now that you know what this Privacy Policy covers, you may have the following questions: </p><p>

<b>WHAT INFORMATION DOES DUMPALINK COLLECT?</b></p><p>

First and foremost, we DO NOT intentionally collect information from children under the age of 13.  We realize that the reach of Dumpalink may be broad and we have taken steps to ensure the safety of our users or visitors. </p><p>

<b>General User Registration</b>: When you register to become a general member of a Dumpalink, we collect certain information about you.  This information is your desired username, e-mail address, country and gender (collectively, "General Membership Information"). Once registered, you will have the opportunity to create your personal profile.  ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO SHARE WITH THE  PUBLIC SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED ON YOUR PERSONAL PROFILE..</p><p>


<b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b>:  Dumpalink also collects non-personally identifiable information about you.  Currently, upon registration, Dumpalink only collects your IP address, which cannot personally identify you.  Dumpalink also complies user data in the aggregate for purposes of demographic compilations and other data that can help us enhance our user�s experience. </p><p>

<b>Dumpalink Community Features</b>: Once you register for Dumpalink, you will also have a chance, at your sole determination, to share other information about yourself via your personal profile.

In any event, we encourage you to make yourself familiar with the privacy policy specific to any such event prior to your agreement to participate. Dumpalink will endeavor to conspicuously distinguish Dumpalink sponsored contests and sweepstakes from that of any third party sponsored contest or sweepstakes. </p><p>


<b>WHAT IS COLLECTING THE ABOVE INFORMATION?</b></p><p>
