            <p>No information is sold or released to anyone about visitors to 
              Dump.com without prior consent or a court order. In other words, 
              no information is released to anyone unless you give permission 
              first.</p>
            <p>Dump.com does not attempt to collect personal information from 
              children. Note that Dump.com cannot always determine that a user 
              is a child. Dump.com does not maintain databases of children or 
              adults.</p>
            <p>When visiting any Internet site, your unique address called an 
              "IP address" is recorded. Dump.com does not release any information 
              about the collection of this address to any third party except under 
              court order. Dump.com archives the log files in order to create 
              aggregate statistical reports, detect errors on the web site, and 
              for security reasons. The log files are eventually deleted.</p>
            <p>IP reports for advertisement clicks are shared with the advertiser. 
              However, they usually have this information already since it is 
              captured by their server when you view or click an ad. This is done 
              to verify billing for the ads. No additional information associated 
              with any specific user is provided to the advertisers.</p>
            <p align="center">Overview</p>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us. Dump.com's service is free for 
              all to use, and prior registration is not needed.</p>
            <p>Dump.com will explicitly ask when it needs information that personally 
              identifies you. All personally identifiable information Dump.com collects 
              is only gathered with your voluntary act. Dump.com keeps all information 
              private and does not, and will not, share it with any third parties 
              except under these circumstances:</p>
            <p>- When such action is necessary to conform to legal requirements 
              or comply with legal process.</p>
            <p>- When such action is necessary to protect and defend the rights 
              or property of Dump.com.</p>
            <p>Dump.com uses cookies as part of tracking process for advertisement 
              banners so you do not see the same ad repeatedly, but cookies will 
              not be used to personally identify you without your prior consent.</p>
            <p>Some links on Dump.com will take visitors outside its web server. 
              Although these links were established to provide access to useful 
              information, Dump.com is not responsible for any of these sites 
              or their content.</p>
