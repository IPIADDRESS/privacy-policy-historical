<p><strong><span>For EEA users</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Dianomi does not cookie EEA users (and other users from countries were GDPR applies) for the purpose of behavioural targeting. Dianomi will serve ads to EEA users contextually and therefore will not require users’ consent for targeting purposes.</span></p>
<p><span>Apart from as stated above, generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email and for behavioural targeting. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by </span><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="#contact-us"><span>contacting us</span></a><span>.</span><span> &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We have established the following personal data control mechanisms:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Promotional offers from us - </span></strong></p>
<p><span>For users outside the EEA, We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). In most cases we will show you recommendations based on the context of the page and not on your personal data profile.</span></p>
<p><span>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or if you provided us with your details when you entered your details in one of our form </span></p>
