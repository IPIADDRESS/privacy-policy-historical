<h1>Diabetic Connect Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>The Diabetic Connect has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Diabetic Connect.</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
  <li>We do not disclose your private online communications.</li>
  <li>We do not use any information about where you personally navigate on the Diabetic Connect site or the Web, and we do not give it out to others.</li>
  <li>We use secure technology, privacy protection controls, and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your personal information.</li>
  <li>We will advise you if and when changes to this policy are made.</li>
</ul>

<p>Diabetic Connect registration forms collect contact information (e.g., name, email address, phone number, and physical address) and demographic information (e.g., gender and age). We use this data to tailor your experience at the Diabetic Connect site, displaying content we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. This information is occasionally shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. You control which (if any) of the details of your contact and demographic information can be viewed by other members of the site.</p>

<p>When you use Diabetic Connect, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.</p>

<p>Within the community site, you may post User Content on the Site at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored your User Content.</p>

<p>Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on Diabetic Connect is a violation of the Terms of Service and should be reported to <a href="mailto:community@alliancehealth.com">community@alliancehealth.com</a>.</p>

<p>If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email or instant message inviting him or her to visit the site. Diabetic Connect stores this information to send this one-time invitation, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:community@alliancehealth.com">community@alliancehealth.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

<p>From time to time, we share aggregated data regarding the users of our services (for example, information such as the percentage of our users that are diabetics, or that users who choose one type of service request a related service a certain percentage of the time). Some of this data may include the data obtained as described in the "cookies" section, but no personally identifiable information is included in these types of statistics.</p>

<p>The Diabetic Connect may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the Diabetic Connect site's Terms of Use.</p>

<p>The same policy applies in cases where we believe an individual may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights or property of Diabetic Connect, other Diabetic Connect site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p>

<p>The Diabetic Connect may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services. The Diabetic Connect may also display entity names as part of the registration process to facilitate an individual registrant's affiliation with the correct entity.</p>

<h2>Cookies and IP address information</h2>
<p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information.</p>

<p>We use cookies for application functions, login purposes and to deliver content on our Web site that is specific to your interests, but we do not use information from cookies for any marketing purposes, nor do we make that information available to third parties.</p>

<p>The cookie does not track any personal information about you, provide us with any way to contact you, or extract any information from your computer.</p>

<p>We hope you will want the better service that cookies provide, but you may set your browser to refuse cookies. However, by doing so, you will not be able to successfully use this service.</p>

<h2>Diabetic Connect relationships with other companies</h2>
<p>The Diabetic Connect may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.</p>

<p>Certain products and services marketed through the Diabetic Connect are made available by partner companies with which the Diabetic Connect has a strategic alliance. To obtain these products and services you may be required to visit another company's Web site or a site they share with the Diabetic Connect. When ordering, registering for, or purchasing products or services from these partners, you will be entering into an agreement with that partner, and not with the Diabetic Connect. In these cases, this privacy policy does not apply; instead, the privacy policy of the partner providing the goods or services will apply.</p>

<p>We urge you to read and understand our partners' policies before entering into agreements with them. We are committed to partnering with companies that share our privacy concerns. The Diabetic Connect, however, cannot control the way these partners collect or use information.</p>

<p>If you have questions about our partners' privacy policies or the privacy policies of these other sites, we encourage you to contact them directly.</p>

<p>Occasionally we may share information with our sponsors and partners. We will share such information on an aggregate basis and will never reveal information about individual users of the site without consent.</p>

<h2>Securing information entered by visitors</h2>
<p>We use industry-standard technology to keep your personal information and information you have entered into our site as secure as possible. We also have put in place privacy protection control systems designed to ensure that your personal data remain safe and private.</p>

<p>Each and every Diabetic Connect employee servicing the website is obligated to abide by this privacy policy. Employees who violate our privacy policies are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</p>

<p>Only authorized Diabetic Connect employees servicing the website are permitted to have access to your personal information, and such access is limited by need.</p>

<h2>Disclosure on Diabetic Connect Offers</h2>
<p>All Diabetic Connect offers are subject to participation by the partner (provider), product availability, and any applicable state or federal laws that govern such offers. Any offers shown are reasonable facsimiles, and participating partners (providers) reserve the right to withdraw offer, substitute another product, or modify offer at their sole discretion.</p>

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Diabetic Connect may amend this policy from time to time.</p>

<p>A Note to Parents on our Privacy Policy Regarding Children</p>
<p>Diabetic Connect is very sensitive to privacy issues and we are proud of our longtime commitment to our customers. We are especially careful in any communications with one of our most treasured customers—children and families. We do not collect personal information from children 12 and under. We do not associate cookie data with personal information about children.</p>
