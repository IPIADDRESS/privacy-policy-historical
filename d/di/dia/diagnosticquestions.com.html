                    EEDI LTD. (<b>We</b>) are committed to protecting and

                    This policy (together with our terms and conditions and any
                    other documents referred to in them) sets out the basis on
                    which any personal data we collect from you, or that you
                    provide to us, will be processed by us in accordance with
                    applicable legislation. Please read the following carefully to
                    understand our views and practices regarding your personal
                    data and how we will treat it. This policy applies whether you
                    use our products and services through www.eedi.co.uk, www.diagnosticquestions.com or our
                    mobile applications (collectively, the Site). By using the

                    London, England, SE1 3ER, is the data controller.

                    What information are we going to collect from you?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    1. The types and amounts of information collected will vary
                    depending on whether the user is a student, parent/guardian or
                    teacher and how users use the Site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Where we collect information directly from a student under
                    the age of 16, we will also ask for a parent/guardian email
                    address from the student so we can seek verifiable
                    parental/guardian consent to the collection and processing of
                    the student’s personal data. In cases, however, where we
                    collect personal data in respect of students from their
                    teachers or schools, we will rely on the authority of the
                    teachers or schools to provide such data to us and will not
                    seek to obtain separate parental/guardian consent to the
                    collection and processing of such students’ personal data.
                </p>
