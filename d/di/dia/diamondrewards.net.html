	<h2 align="center">Diamond Rewards’s Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>This Privacy Policy has been published to  provide a clear and concise outline of how and when personal information is  collected, disclosed, used, stored and otherwise handled by Diamond Rewards and its  related companies ("Diamond Rewards "). The Policy relates to personal  information collected by any means and by any technology.</p>
	<p>Diamond Rewards treats the handling of your  personal information very seriously. To that end, Diamond Rewards has systems and  procedures in place to protect your privacy in relation to the handling of your  personal information.</p>
	<p>Diamond Rewards abides by the National Privacy  Principles, which provide a scheme in relation to the collection, disclosure,  use and storage of personal information. Diamond Rewards’s objective is to handle  information responsibly and provide you with some control over the way  information about you is handled.</p>
	<h3>&nbsp;The Privacy Act provides for exemptions:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>in relation to employee records (being records relating to a current or former  employment relationship between Diamond Rewards and the individual); and</li>
		<li>from coverage in relation to the journalism activities of Diamond Rewards.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Diamond Rewards is not required to comply with  the National Privacy Principles when dealing with employee records or personal  information collected in the course of its Internet activities.</p>
	<h2>1. Collection of Personal Information</h2>
	<p>Personal information is information or  opinion from which an individual's identity may be ascertained. The nature of  personal information collected by Diamond Rewards generally comprises an individual's  name and contact details (including address, phone, fax and e-mail). Such  personal information is collected for the purposes of arranging, conducting and  promoting Diamond Rewards's Internet activities.</p>
	<p>Diamond Rewards also collects other types of  personal information from time to time (eg. credit information and drivers  licence details), and will inform you upon collecting such information the  purpose for which it is being collected.</p>
	<p>Diamond Rewards does not collect personal  information unless it is necessary for Diamond Rewards to perform one or more of its  functions and activities. On occasion, some of this personal information may be  sensitive and Diamond Rewards will only collect it with your consent or when required  to by law.</p>
	<p>Diamond Rewards will destroy personal information  when it is no longer required for such functions and activities.</p>
	<p>Diamond Rewards&nbsp;  will generally collect personal information from you directly. For  example, Diamond Rewards may collect personal information via telephone or letter, or  when you attend a function or event, enter a competition, provide a resume or  enter an agreement.</p>
	<p>There may be other occasions when Diamond Rewards  needs to source personal information from an external third party. For example,  Diamond Rewards may collect personal information from credit agencies when  establishing a credit account. Diamond Rewards may also collect personal information  regarding potential agents or employees from recruitment agencies. Diamond Rewards  may also collect personal information from call centers involved in running  competitions for Diamond Rewards.</p>
	<h2>2. Use &amp; Disclosure of Personal  Information</h2>
	<p>Personal information provided to Diamond Rewards  may be shared with related companies within the Network, where it will be kept  strictly confidential and will only be disclosed on a need to know basis.</p>
	<p>Diamond Rewards&nbsp;  will use and disclose your personal information for the purpose for  which the personal information was initially collected.</p>
	<p>Diamond Rewards may also use that personal  information for a purpose related to the initial purpose of collection if that  other purpose would be within your reasonable expectations. Related purposes  might include internal auditing and administration, adding your name to a  contact list, guest list or invitation list or helping us to identify  production and Internet broadcast activities which may be of benefit or  interest to you.</p>
	<p>Diamond Rewards&nbsp;  will not use or disclose your personal information for any other  purposes without first obtaining your express or implied consent. Diamond Rewards may  however be required to disclose your personal information without your consent  if the disclosure is:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>required or authorized by law;</li>
		<li>required in order to investigate an unlawful activity;</li>
		<li>required by an enforcement body for investigative activities; or</li>
		<li>necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to a person's life, health  or safety, or to public health or safety.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Generally, Diamond Rewards will retain your  personal information within HK and not use or disclose it overseas. However, on  some occasions the information may need to be transferred overseas in order to  perform one of the Network's functions or activities. In these circumstances,  Diamond Rewards will either obtain your express or implied consent or will use its  best endeavors to ensure that your personal information will receive  protection similar to that which it would have if the information were in HK.</p>
	<h2>3. Direct marketing</h2>
	<p>From time to time Diamond Rewards may use your  personal information to identify Internet and Internet broadcasting activities  which may be of interest to you to send you information regarding Diamond Rewards’s  programs and products, and those available through Diamond Rewards’s business  partners.</p>
	<p>If you do not wish to receive direct  marketing information, please let Diamond Rewards know. Diamond Rewards will take immediate  steps to ensure that you do not receive any direct marketing information in  future.</p>
	<h2>4. Personal Information Quality</h2>
	<p>Diamond Rewards 's objective is to ensure that  all personal information collected by Diamond Rewards is accurate, complete and  up-to-date. To assist Diamond Rewards in achieving its objective, please contact the  Privacy Officer if any of your details change. Further, if you believe that the  information Diamond Rewards holds is not accurate, complete or up-to-date, please contact  the Privacy Officer in order to have the information corrected.</p>
	<h2>5. Personal Information Security</h2>
	<p>Diamond Rewards is committed to keeping your  personal information secure, and we will take all reasonable precautions to  protect your personal information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse or  alteration.</p>
	<p>Your personal information may be stored in  hard copy documents, or electronically on Diamond Rewards ‘s software or systems.</p>
	<p>Diamond Rewards maintains physical security over  its paper and electronic data stores, such as locks and security systems.  Diamond Rewards also maintains computer and network security using passwords to  control and restrict access to authorized staff for approved purposes. Where  information is particularly sensitive, the information is overwritten and then  manually deleted.</p>
	<h2>6. Access To Personal Information</h2>
	<p>You may request access to the personal  information that Diamond Rewards holds about you.</p>
	<p>The procedure for gaining access is as  follows:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>All requests for access to your personal information must be made in writing  and addressed to the Privacy Officer.</li>
		<li>You must provide as much detail as possible regarding the business entity,  department or person to whom you believe your personal information has been  provided, and when. This will allow Diamond Rewards to process your request faster.</li>
		<li>Diamond Rewards will acknowledge your request within 14 days, and access will usually  be granted within 14 days, or if it is more complicated, 30 days.  Diamond Rewards&nbsp; will inform you if this  timeframe is not achievable.</li>
		<li>You will be asked to verify your identity.</li>
		<li>A fee may apply to such access in the event that a request for access is  onerous or time consuming. Such a fee will cover staff costs involved in  locating and collating information, and reproduction costs.</li>
		<li>Depending on the circumstances, you may be forwarded the information by mail or  email, or you may be required to personally inspect your records at the  appropriate place.</li>
		<li>You will be given the opportunity to correct any personal information which is  no longer accurate.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>In some circumstances, Diamond Rewards may not be  in a position to provide access. Such circumstances include where:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>access would create a serious threat to safety;</li>
		<li>providing access will have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other  individuals;</li>
		<li>denying access is required or authorized by law;</li>
		<li>the request is frivolous;</li>
		<li>legal proceedings are underway;</li>
		<li>negotiations may be prejudiced by such access; or</li>
		<li>access would reveal a commercially sensitive decision making process.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>If Diamond Rewards denies access to your personal  information, it will provide you with reasons in writing.</p>
	<h2>6. Changes To This Policy</h2>
	<p>Diamond Rewards may change this Policy from time  to time for any reason and will update the Policy accordingly.</p>
	<h2>7. Complaints</h2>
	<p>If you believe that your privacy has been  infringed you are entitled to complain. All complaints should initially be in  writing and directed to the Privacy Officer. Diamond Rewards will respond to your  complaint as soon as possible, within 14 working days, to let you know who is  responsible for managing your query.
