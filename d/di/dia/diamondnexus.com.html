          <p><strong> </strong><strong>Our Commitment To Privacy:</strong></p>          
          <p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your  privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and  the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.  To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at  every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. </p>
          <p><strong>The Information We  Collect:</strong></p>
          <p>This notice applies to all information collected or  submitted on the Diamond Nexus Labs' website. On some pages, you can order  products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of  personal information collected at these pages are: <br>
            Name <br>
            Address <br>
            Email address <br>
            Phone number <br>
            Credit/Debit Card Information <br>
            (etc.) </p>
          <p>On some pages, you can submit information  about other people. For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent  directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's address. In  this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are: <br>
            Name <br>
            Address <br>
            Phone Number <br>
            (etc.) </p>
          <p><strong>The Way We Use  Information:</strong> </p>
          <p>We use the information you provide about  yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share  this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to  complete that order. </p>
          <p>We use the information you provide about  someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm  delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the  extent necessary to complete that order. </p>
          <p>We use return email addresses to answer the  email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not  shared with outside parties. </p>
          <p>You can register with our website if you would  like to receive our catalog as well as updates on our new products and  services. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this  purpose unless you fill out the registration form. </p>
          <p>We use non-identifying and aggregate  information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For  example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a  certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women  filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could  be used to identify those individuals. </p>
          <p>Finally, we never use or share the personally  identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones  described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or  otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. </p>
          <p><strong>Our Commitment To  Data Security</strong>:</p>
          <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data  accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place  appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and  secure the information we collect online. </p>
          <p><strong>Our Commitment To  Children's Privacy:</strong> </p>
          <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is  especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information  at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our  website is structured to attract anyone under 13. </p>
          <p><strong>How You Can Access  Or Correct Your Information</strong>:</p>
          <p>You can access all your personally  identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by setting up an  account and logging in with your personal private password. We use this  procedure to better safeguard your information. </p>
          <p>You can correct factual errors in your  personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows  error. </p>
          <p>To protect your privacy and security, we will  also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or  making corrections. </p>
          <p><strong>How To Contact Us</strong>:</p>
          <p>Should you have other questions or concerns about these  privacy policies, please call us at 1-800-509-4990 or send us an email at <a href="mailto:customerservice@diamondnexuslabs.com">customerservice@diamondnexuslabs.com</a>.</p></td>
