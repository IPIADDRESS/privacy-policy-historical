<p>We may also use clear gifs (also known as web bugs or web beacons), which are tiny graphics embedded in web pages and email messages that we use, in connection with cookies, to collect non-personal information from users to analyze site usage, manage content on the site, track visits to other related sites, and track the performance of online advertising. </p>
