						Moreover, upon the appropriate request of a government agency, law enforcement, court or as otherwise required by
						law, Dialpad may disclose personally identifiable information.

						receive promotional materials from Dialpad and/or its partners, you will be giving Dialpad permission to access your
						information on behalf of pre-screened third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.&nbsp; We will not share
						your personal information with our partners unless you have opted to receive promotional emails from such partners.&nbsp;
						In some situations, we will also share your personal information, on a confidential basis, with third parties who perform
						a particular service on our behalf, such as sending emails; however, these parties are not allowed to use personal
						information except for the limited purpose of providing the particular service on our behalf.
