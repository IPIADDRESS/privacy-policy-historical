              sent to your web browser. We use cookies to:</p>
            <p>1. Keep track of your session ID and user name. <br>
              2. Display your phonebook and logbook. <br>
              3. Make sure that you do not see the same ad repeatedly. <br>
              4. Estimate the audience size of the Dialpad web site. <br>

              web browser to not accept cookies, you cannot use our service.</p>
            <p class="heading">Information Dialpad Gathers and Tracks</p>
            <p>We collect IP addresses to administer our web site and diagnose 
              problems. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic 
              information, which we may report to our advertisers on an aggregate 
              basis. In addition, we collect information regarding log times, 
              call durations, call numbers, country code and region code of our 
              users for internal data analyses only.</p>
            <p>Our web site's registration form asks for contact information (such 
              as name and email address) and demographic information (such as 
              zip code, age, and income level.) We use contact information from 
              your registration form to send information to you about Dialpad 
              and, with your permission, to send promotional information from 
              Dialpad and/or its partners. The contact information is also used 
              to contact you when necessary about issues concerning the use of 
              our service. We use demographic information to tailor your experience 
              at our web site, showing you content and advertisements that we 
              think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according 
              to your preferences. This information is shared with advertisers 
              on an aggregate basis for advertising and promotional purposes.</p>
            <p>You may also choose on the registration page or your account page

              we do not have access to this information and they are not subject 
              to Dialpad's privacy policy. As described above, some general customer 
              data is shared with the advertising companies on an aggregate basis,

            <p class="heading">Third Party Advertisers</p>

              to serve ads when you visit Dialpad's web site. These companies 
              may use information (not including your name, address, email address 
              or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites, 
              such as the number of times you have viewed an advertisement, in

              our ad serving partner, to help manage our online advertising. These 
              clear GIFs enable our ad server to recognize a browser's cookie

              is not personally identifiable. To learn more about our third-party
