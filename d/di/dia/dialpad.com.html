						<p><strong>Information Dialpad Gathers and Tracks</strong></p>
						<p>
							We collect IP addresses to administer our website and diagnose 
              problems. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic 
              information. In addition, we collect information regarding log times, 
              call duration, call numbers, country code and region code of our 
              users for internal data analyses only. Such website usage information 
              is not personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable 
              information is data about you that distinguishes you specifically 
              such as first name and last name, email address, postal address, 
              etc.
						</p>

						
            <p>Our website's registration process asks for contact information 
              (such as name and email address), by which you can be personally 
              identified. When you purchase products or services on our website, 
              you will be asked for financial information, such as account or 
              credit card numbers, as well as billing verification information, 
              such as billing address. </p>
						
            <p>We do not target our services to children under the age of 18. 
              We do not collect personal information from children under the age 
              of 18 without parental consent. Minors under the age of 18 can only 
              use our service with parental consent.</p>
            <p>Dialpad values you as a customer and works diligently to protect 
              your information. The information that you provide is never sold 
              to third parties.</p>
						<p><strong>How Dialpad Uses Information</strong></p>
						<p>
						We use contact information from your registration form to contact 
              you when necessary about issues concerning the use of our service. 
              We collect and remember feedback that you provide to us, in order 
              to troubleshoot in the event that you contact our customer support 
              department.

            <p>We use demographic and website usage information internally to 
              improve the products and services we provide to you.</p>
            <p>If you have provided credit card information, we will not use your 
              credit card information for any purpose other than for processing payments.
              We use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services.
              This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable
              information for any other purposes other than as described herein.
              </p>

            <p>During the period between October 1999 and January 2003, Dialpad 
              allowed its users to 'opt in' on our registration form to receive 
              promotional emails from Dialpad and our partners.&nbsp; At that time, 
              users were given the ability to 'opt in' and to then complete a survey 
              form that asked for specific demographic information.&nbsp; This information 
              has been shared with reputable third parties.&nbsp; If you were a Dialpad 
              user during this time and are receiving emails from any of these partners or
              from Dialpad and you wish to unsubscribe from their services, please follow
              the instructions contained in any promotional email to unsubscribe from
              receiving future promotional emails.&nbsp; In addition, please send an
              email to <a href="mailto:privacy@dialpad.com">privacy@dialpad.com</a>
              and include the email address to which you are receiving email and you will be
              removed from the Dialpad database and will not be included in any future data
              exchanges between Dialpad and our third party marketing partners.&nbsp;
              Any email that is coming to you as a result of your having registered with
              Dialpad during that time period should have a clear and working link to allow
              you to unsubscribe; please report any such emails that do not to
              <a href="mailto:privacy@dialpad.com">privacy@dialpad.com</a>.
