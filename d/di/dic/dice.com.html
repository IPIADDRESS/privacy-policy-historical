        <p> We at Dice are committed to good privacy practices regarding your 
          personal information. Your loyalty as a job seeker, customer or visitor 
          is important, and we hope that our concerns regarding your privacy, 
          as described in this policy (the "Privacy Policy" or "Policy"), 
          demonstrate our commitment to making your experience with Dice an enjoyable 
          and satisfying one. </p>
        <p> Although Dice respects the privacy of all those who visit our Web 
          sites and use our online services, we do collect information from our 
          visitors, including job seekers and customers. This Privacy Policy governs 
          your interaction with the Dice web site and your registration for and 
          use of Dice's online services (collectively, the "Services"). 
          Except as set forth within this Privacy Policy and our <a href="terms_and_conditions.jsp">Terms 
          of Use</a> and other published guidelines, we do not release personally 
          identifiable information about our members and visitors without their 
          permission.</p>
        <p> Note that, by using the Services, you signify your agreement to this 
          Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use 
          the Services. Your continued use of the Services subsequent to changes 
          to this Policy will mean that you accept the changes; therefore, please 
          bookmark this page and review it periodically. If you have any questions 
          regarding this Privacy Policy, or any other privacy issues in connection 
          with the Services, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacy@dice.com">privacy@dice.com</a>.</p>
        <p><br>
          <b>A. The information we gather</b>.</p>
        <p> Dice gathers two types of information about users:</p>
        <p> 1. <b>Non-personally identifiable information (information that does 
          not identify a specific individual)</b>: When visitors use the Services, 
          we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, 
          which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and 
          which links were "clicked." Collecting such information involves 
          the collection and logging of IP addresses, operating system, and browser 
          software used by each user of the Services. Although such information 
          is not personally identifiable, we can determine from the IP address 
          a visitor's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of 
          his or her point of connectivity.</p>
        <p> The non-personally identifiable information we collect helps us identify 
          the most popular areas of our web site and determine the effectiveness 
          of our promotional activities. In addition, we may disclose some of 
          this information to advertisers to inform them of the number of people 
          who have seen and/or clicked through their advertisements.</p>
        <p> We collect non-personally identifiable information in part through 
          the use of "cookies" - that is, small text files placed on 
          your computer's hard drive - that help us determine the type of content 
          and pages to which you link, the length of time you spend at any particular 
          area of the Services, and the Services you choose to use. Cookies also 
          tell us which advertisements you have seen on our Services, allowing 
          us to continue to provide many of these Services at little or no cost 
          to you. Essentially, cookies are your identification cards for the Dice 
          computers or servers that placed them there. Cookies are only read by 
          the server that placed them, and are unable to execute any code or virus; 
          they will not permit a Web site operator to learn any personally identifiable 
          information (see below) about you unless you have previously provided 
          that information to the Web site operator or you have set the preferences 
          in your browser to provide this information.</p>
        <p> Cookies allow Dice to serve you better and more efficiently, and to 
          personalize your experience with the Services - for example, by allowing 
          us to save your password so that you do not have to reenter it each 
          time you use the Services. Nevertheless, you should be able to control 
          how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser. For more 
          information on how to do so, please refer to the documentation accompanying 
          your browser.</p>
        <p> Dice uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online
            advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner,
            DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie
            on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which
            advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us,
            or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies
            and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is
            anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your
            name, address, telephone number, or email address.  For more information
            about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these
            technologies, go to <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy" target="_blank">http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy</a>.
        </p><p> Please note that our advertisers and their designees, as well as other 
          third parties, may collect information about you through cookies or 
          other technologies when they serve advertisements through the Services 
          or when you visit their Web site(s). Additionally, the Services contain 
          links to other third party Web sites, including co-branded or other 
          affiliated sites which may or may not be owned or operated by or in 
          conjunction with Dice. You acknowledge that we do not monitor or control 
          the information collection or privacy practices of any third parties, 
          and are not responsible for their practices or the content of their 
          web sites, including their use of any information (such as IP number, 
          browser type, or operating system) collected when visitors or Members 
          "click through" links to their sites or view advertisements 
          served by them. Even though certain information collected by such third 
          parties might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you 
          to become familiar with their privacy practices, and to contact such 
          third parties if you have any questions about their respective privacy 
          policies.</p>
        <p> <b>2. Personally identifiable information</b>: In certain areas of 
          the Services - such as those in which you Announce Availability, complete 
          a profile, submit your résumé, create a new account, or 
          enter Dice-sponsored contests or promotions - we may request that you 
          provide us with certain personally identifiable information, such as 
          your e-mail address, name, zip code, profession, or work experience. 
          We will, in such situations, seek to identify which informational items 
          are required and which are optional.</p>
        <p>Job seekers should post profiles and resumes on Dice only if they wish 
          such information to be viewed by Dice's customers. At any time, job 
          seekers may elect that their profile and resume not be searchable by 
          Dice's customers by logging into their account and changing the status 
          of their profile or, if that is not possible, they may contact Dice 
          at <a href="mailto:support@dice.com">support@dice.com</a> and we will 
          make the change for them.</p>
        <p>In addition, job seekers may elect to make their profile searchable 
          by Dice customers on a confidential basis only. In this case, the user's 
          name, contact information and resume will not be displayed to customers 
          performing searches on Dice. If the customer desires to contact the 
          confidential job seeker regarding an employment opportunity, they will 
          send an email to the job seeker through the Dice system. Dice will forward 
          the email to the seeker's email address. The seeker's email address 
          will not be provided directly to the customer. </p>
        <p> <i>The Services are not available to children under 13 years of age</i>. 
          We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from 
          children under 13 years of age.</p>
        <p> Please note that Dice cannot control the acts of users of the Services. 
          All members and visitors should be aware that, when they disclose personally 
          identifiable information in a resume or profile or other medium, the 
          information may be collected and used by others to send that person 
          unsolicited email from other parties outside Dice. In the event that 
          you encounter any Dice user who is improperly collecting or using information 
          about you or other users, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@dice.com">privacy@dice.com</a>.</p>
        <p><b>B. How we use (and do not use) the information we gather</b>. </p>
        <dt>Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways 
          we use the information we gather. Keep in mind that, while Dice encourages 
          all third parties involved - including but not limited to its advertisers 
          - to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors and 
          members and to otherwise handle personal information in a responsible 
          manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions 
          or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use 
          information received either from Dice or independently. Nevertheless, 
          in the event you encounter any third party associated with, or who claims 
          association with Dice, who you feel is improperly collecting or using 
          information about you, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@dice.com">privacy@dice.com</a> 
          . We will be happy to forward your message to the third party or contact 
          the third party on your behalf.</dt>
        <p> 1. <b>How we use (and do not use) non-personally identifiable information</b>: 
          We use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to 
          build higher quality, more useful Services by performing statistical 
          analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors 
          and members, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific 
          areas of the Services. We may provide statistical information based 
          on this data to advertisers and other current and potential business 
          partners. We may also use the aggregate data to inform these third parties 
          as to the number of people who have seen and clicked through links to 
          their sites.</p>
        <p> 2. <b>How we use (and do not use) personally identifiable information</b>: 
          Dice does not sell, re-sell or distribute for re-sale your personally 
          identifiable information.
          Dice's customers may only use the information provided in resumes and 
          profiles of job seekers to evaluate seekers' qualifications for the 
          customer's open job opportunities. Job seekers should be aware, however, 
          that Dice has no way to control how a customer actually uses the service 
          and how they use the resume and profile information. If you believe 
          a Dice customer is using personally identifiable information inappropriately, 
          please notify Dice at <a href="mailto:privacy@dice.com">privacy@dice.com</a>.</p>
        <p>Please note that Dice reserves the right to disclose information submitted 
          by or concerning any visitor or member as we reasonably feel is necessary 
          to protect our systems or business. Specifically, but without limitation, 
          we reserve the right to disclose such information when a visitor or 
          member is in violation of our <a href="terms_and_conditions.jsp">Terms 
          of Use</a> or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably 
          suspected of partaking) in any harmful, infringing or illegal activity, 
          even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, and to disclose 
          such information in response to court and governmental orders, civil 
          subpoenas, discovery requests, and as otherwise required by law, as 
          well as in response to allegations of infringement. We cooperate with 
          law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers 
          or services for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report 
          any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation 
          or prosecution, or to suspend or terminate your membership in connection 
          with any suspected illegal or infringing activity. Finally, Dice reserves 
          the right to assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third 
          party your personally identifiable information in connection with an 
          assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of 
          any portion or all of Dice's or its affiliated entities' assets or stock.</p>
        <p> Subject to the foregoing, Dice uses your personally identifying information 
          in several ways: </p>
      </dl>
      <ul>
        <li>to customize various aspects of the Services to your preferences;</li>
        <p></p><li>to determine which advertisements or sponsor messages will appear 
          on your screen;</li>
        <p></p><li>to send to you Dice solicitations, product announcements, and the 
          like that we feel may be of interest to you (you may "opt out" 
          of receiving these materials, as provided below);</li>
        <p></p><li>to send to you certain e-mail messages that are critical to your use 
          of the Services, such as system status updates or order confirmations 
          (because these messages contain important information, you may not be 
          able to "opt out" of receiving such messages);</li>
        <p></p><li>to "pre-populate" forms that are displayed for the purpose 
          of collecting individual data by Dice and/or its sponsors (in no case 
          will pre-populating a form automatically transfer any data to an advertiser 
          or other third party - only if you voluntarily request that such data 
          be transferred will any such transfer take place, e.g., by clicking 
          the "Submit" button); and</li>
        <p></p><li>as may be necessary to support the operation of the Services, such

      </ul>
      <dl> 
        <p> In addition to the circumstances described above, Dice may disclose 
          your personally-identifiable information to third parties as follows:</p>
        <p> 
        </p><ul>
          <li>When a job seeker posts a profile or resume on Dice on a non-confidential 
            basis, such information will be shared with Dice's customers. (Note 
            that at any time, job seekers may elect that their profile and resume 
            not be searchable by Dice's customers by logging into their account 
            and changing the status of their profile or they may contact Dice 
            at <a href="mailto:support@dice.com">support@dice.com</a> and we will 
            make the change for them.) 
            <p> 
          </p></li><li> When a job seeker elects to make his or her profile searchable 
            by Dice customers on a confidential basis only, the user's name, contact 
            information and resume will not be displayed to customers performing 
            searches on Dice. If the customer desires to contact the confidential 
            job seeker regarding an employment opportunity, it will send an email 
            to the job seeker through the Dice system. Dice will forward the email 
            to the seeker's email address. The seeker's email address will not 
            be provided directly to the customer. </li>
          <dt><br>
          </dt>
          <li>If you "opt in" to receive promotional materials (see 
            below), information you have made available to Dice may be made available 
            to third parties who provide goods or services that we believe may 
            be of interest to you.</li>
          <dt><br>
          </dt>
          <li>If you provide us with your credit card information, we will not 
            release that information to third parties unless necessary to complete 
            a transaction between you and such a third party. Credit card transactions 
            are handled by a third-party financial institution, which receives 
            the credit card number and other personal identifying information 
            only to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions.</li>
          <p> 
          </p><li> All information made available to Dice may be made available to 
            our contractors and consultants, and professional advisors (such as 
            attorneys or accountants), but only to the extent necessary for them 
            to perform services on our behalf, and only under a duty of confidentiality.<br>
        </li></ul>
        <br>
        3. "<b>Opting In</b>": You may choose to "opt in" 
        to receive promotional materials from Dice and/or its affiliates, advertisers, 
        or other business partners. You will be given the opportunity to "opt 
        in" to receive such materials at every point at which we collect 
        personally identifiable information through the Services. You may change 
        your "opt in" status or "opt out" with respect to 
        such materials at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@dice.com">privacy@dice.com</a>. 
        You may also contact those third parties directly. 
        <p><br>
          <b>C. Surveys and Sweepstakes</b>: </p>
        <p>Occasionally, Dice may conduct surveys in order to better deliver advertisements 
          and content and to better understand your needs relating to the Services. 
          We will not share your survey information with any third party, except 
          in aggregate form. In addition, if and when we sponsor sweepstakes or 
          other promotions, or third parties sponsor such promotions in conjunction 
          with us, either we or the third party will post relevant privacy information 
          in the official rules and/or registration area for the sweepstakes or 
          promotion. That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with 
          this Policy, will govern that particular promotion or sweepstakes - 
          please remember to read it carefully.</p>
        <p><br>
          <b>D. Deleting or correcting personal information.</b></p>
        <p> If you would like to have your personally identifiable information 
          removed from Dice's database, or would like to correct an error in such 
          information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@dice.com">privacy@dice.com</a>, 
          and we will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request. Keep 
          in mind, however, that there will be residual information that will 
          remain within Dice databases, access logs, and other records, which 
          may or may not contain such personally identifiable information. The 
          residual information will not be used for commercial purposes; however 
          Dice reserves the right, from time to time, to re-contact former customers 
          or users of Dice.</p>
