<p>The following discloses our privacy policy for this web site: Dictionary.com. We take your privacy concerns seriously and we strive to earn and keep your trust. Please do not hesitate to contact us with your questions and concerns (contact information is provided below).</p>
<p>We do not share your personal information, including your e-mail address, with other parties. We hate spam as much as you do, so we won't give your information to anyone.</p>
<p>We do not send unsolicited e-mail. If you are receiving e-mail from us, it is because at some point you, or someone with access to your e-mail account, requested it. You can always opt out of any e-mail we send you simply by following the instructions that appear at the bottom of the e-mail message in question. If you are receiving e-mail from us in response to an inquiry you made, you can rest assured that we will use your e-mail address for no purpose other than to respond to your inquiry.</p>
<p>Each time you visit our site, we collect the limited information that your browser makes available whenever you visit any website. This information includes: (a) your Internet Protocol (IP) address; (b) the address of the last URL you visited prior to clicking through to the Site; (c) your browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform); (d) your browser language; and (e) the data in any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us.</p>
<p>We use your <a href="/search?q=IP%20address">IP address</a> to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic information.</p>
<p>Some elements on the sites such as the sponsored links advertising on our pages, are supplied to us by third parties under contract. We may supply some of the information we collect from you to those third parties so that they can provide those elements for display on the site. We may share the following information with third parties: (a) your Internet Protocol (IP) address; (b) the address of the last URL you visited prior to clicking through to the Site; (c) your browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform); (d) your browser language; (e) the data in any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us; and (f) the search queries you submit. For example, when you submit a query, we transmit it (and some of the related information described above) to our paid listing providers in order to obtain relevant advertising to display in response to your query. These third party companies have their own policies as to record keeping and data retention.</p>
