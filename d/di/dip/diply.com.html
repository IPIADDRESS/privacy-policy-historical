<h1 class="txt_pur_12b">PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
	
<p>We think that creating DIPLYs should be fun and rewarding. So we wanted to make sure that nothing 
detracts from that. We take your privacy seriously and want to make clear what our policy is regarding 
any personal information you may submit.</p>

<h1 class="txt_pur_12b">Information Collected</h1>

<p>We may collect certain information from you when you use our website, such as when you register 
to use our services. This includes personally identifiable information such as your name, email 
address or other contact information. We may also collect non-personally identifiable information 
such as your IP address and the type of browser that you use. We will not disclose your personally-identifiable 
information to any third party without your consent.</p>

<h1 class="txt_pur_12b">Use of Information</h1>

<p>We may display certain personally-identifiable information you provide on the DIPLY page you create, 
such as your name or username, to create a personalized experience for you, users of the DIPLY service 
("Service"), and the recipient of the DIPLY page. We may email you from time to time to let you know of 
new services and features that we are offering. This way you will know if there is something new you may 
want to try.</p><p> 

</p><h1 class="txt_pur_12b">Information Sharing By You</h1>

<p>You have the ability to determine who you invite to become DIPLERS for the DIPLY you create and thus 
determine who has access to the DIPLY. Those DIPLERS who you invite can also invite others to contribute 
to the DIPLY. You can control whether the DIPLY page can be viewed only by your invited and registered 
DIPLERS or by other members of DIPLY or the general public.</p>

<h1 class="txt_pur_12b">Cookies</h1>

<p>We use cookie technology. Cookies allow us to store and retrieve login information, thereby eliminating 
the need for you to repeatedly provide your login information to us. Cookies also make our service easier 
to use and allow us to improve the website. Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your 
computer when you visit a website. You have the option of disabling cookies on your browser but this 
may prevent you from utilizing some of our services.</p>

<h1 class="txt_pur_12b">Other Websites</h1>

<p>Our website may contain links to other websites and their services. Since these websites are not within 
our control, please review their privacy policies to understand their privacy practices. We are not responsible 
for the content or privacy practices of these websites and their owners.</p>

<h1 class="txt_pur_12b">Advertising</h1>

<p>We may share aggregated and non-personally identifiable usage information with our advertising partners and 
other third parties. This allows us to provide you with relevant advertisements, products and/or services. 
Advertisements appearing on our website are provided by our third party partners.</p> 

<h1 class="txt_pur_12b">Required Disclosures</h1>

<p>We may disclose your personally-identifiable information in the event that we believe in good faith we are 
required to do so pursuant to any laws, regulations or legal process or when we believe that it is necessary 
in order to enforce and protect our rights or the public.</p>

<h1 class="txt_pur_12b">Updating and Termination</h1>

<p>You have the ability to update your account profile at any time through your account page.  You may terminate

<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Please check this page for any changes.</p>

<h1 class="txt_pur_12b">Legal Stuff</h1>

<p>We will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with this privacy policy and will take corrective 
actions when we learn of any failure to comply with it. We are not liable for any damages whatsoever, 
including incidental, consequential or punitive damages, relating to this privacy policy.</p>
