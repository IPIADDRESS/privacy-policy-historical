      <p>
        DITTO is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our website
        and customers of our services. We have established this Privacy Policy
        to explain what information we collect and how that information is used.
        By using our website or accessing our Services in any manner, you
        acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this
        Privacy Policy and hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share
        your information in the following ways.
      </p>
      <h2>Here is the information we collect:</h2>
      <h3>Login Information:</h3>
      <p>
        We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us
        including, without limitation, your name, email address, gender, and
        password. If you login using a third party account (like Facebook), we
        will also collect your third party account login credentials as well as
        information you allow us to access including your basic information,
        your profile information, your birthday, interests, likes and locations
        and the user ID’s of your Facebook friends.
      </p>
      <h3>Purchase and Payment Information:</h3>
      <p>
        We store information related to your purchase including, without
        limitation, your phone number, address, zip code and shipping
        preference. Our payment gateway, Authorize.net, stores your credit card
        and payment information.
      </p>
      <h3>Your DITTO:</h3>
      <p>
        If you create a DITTO (a video of you from your webcam or mobile camera
        to virtually try on glasses), we receive and store your DITTO even if
        you don’t have an account. Your DITTOs are considered User Submissions
        should you choose to create them, and we reserve certain rights in your
        User Submissions as explained more fully in our
        <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Server Log Information and Cookies:</h3>
      <p>
        Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and
        record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which
        may include your IP address, device identification, “cookie”
        information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access
        our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are
        identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to
        recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and
        features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be
        able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or
        limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from
        taking advantage of some of our features. Our advertising partners may
        also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads
        that appear on the Services. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use
        of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their
        privacy policies and practices.
      </p>
      <h2>Here is how we use the information we collect:</h2>
      <h3>Login Information:</h3>
      <p>
        We use your login information to allow you to set up a user account and
        profile and to personalize your experience. We use your email address to
        send you promotional emails about DITTO and our products and services.
        We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us, which
        helps us make communications with you more interesting and relevant. We
        neither rent nor sell your Personal Information, defined as any
        personally identifiable information, to anyone. That said, if you do not
        want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference
        <a href="/account/email-preferences">here</a>. You can add, update or
        delete your personal information <a href="/account/edit">here</a>. You
        can delete your account <a href="/account/edit">here</a>. When you update
        or delete your information, however, we may maintain a copy of the
        unrevised information in our records, but never in a manner that would
        identify you personally.
      </p>
      <h3>Purchase and Payment Information:</h3>
      <p>
        We save your address and phone number and our payment gateway
        Authorize.net saves your payment information including your credit card
        number in an effort to save you time during future purchases.
      </p>
      <h3>Your DITTO:</h3>
      <p>
        We save your DITTO so you can access it when you login again later. Even
        if you don’t create an account, we use your DITTO to improve our
        internal virtual fitting algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you opt-in to receive Crowd-Sourced Style Advice, which is described
        in our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>, your DITTO can be used in
        several ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It can appear on our crowd-sourced style advice page, where other
          visitors can vote on which pair of glasses looks best on you.
        </li>
        <li>
          It can appear on a product page to show another use how a specific
          pair of glasses looks on other users.
        </li>
        <li>
          It can appear on our homepage to highlight our virtual try on
          technology.
        </li>
        <li>
          It can appear in advertising and marketing materials in connection
          with our business.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you’d like to opt out of crowd-sourced style advice, you can do so
        <a href="/account/email-preferences">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Server Log Information and Cookies:</h3>
      <p>
        When we collect the usage information described in the Server Log
        Information and Cookies section above, we only use this data in
        aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.
        For example, this aggregate data can tell us how often users use a
        particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to
        make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.
      </p>
      <h2>We will Not Share Your Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
      <p>
        We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally
        identifiable form to anyone. However, we may share your Personal
        Information with third parties as described in this section:
      </p>
      <h3>Information that’s no longer personally identifiable.</h3>
      <p>
        We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you are not
        individually identified, and provide that information to our partners.
        We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners, who may
        use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use
        our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online
        experience. However, we never disclose aggregate information to a
        partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an
        individual.
      </p>
      <h3>Affiliates and Third Parties:</h3>
      <p>
        We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and
        need to share your information with them to provide products or services
        to you; for example, we may use a payment processing company to receive
        and process your credit card transactions for us. Our agents do not have
        any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what
        is necessary to assist us. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California
        residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories
        of Personal Information, which we share with our affiliates and/or third
        parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for
        such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident
        and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to
        <a href="mailto:support@ditto.com">support@ditto.com</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Business Transfers:</h3>
      <p>
        We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions,
        customer information is typically one of the business assets that would
        be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go
        out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of
        control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to
        or acquired by a third party.
      </p>
      <h3>Protection of Ditto and Others:</h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any
        information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court
        order; enforce or apply our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> and
        other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Ditto,
        our employees, our users, or others.
      </p>
      <h2>Legal caveats our lawyers made us add:</h2>
      <p>
        <b>We make effort to keep your account secure but we cannot guarantee
        complete security.</b> Your account is protected by a password for your
        privacy and security. If you access your account via a third party site
        or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via
        that third party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access
        to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting
        your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting
        access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you
        have finished accessing your account. We endeavor to protect the privacy
        of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records,
        but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized
        entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may
        compromise the security of user information at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>We might make updates to this Privacy Policy.</b> If we do this,
        we’ll alert you to changes by placing a notice on 
        <a href="/">www.ditto.com</a>, by emailing you, and/or by some other
        means. Please note that if you haven’t provided us with your email
        address, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services,
        and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you
        use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been
        posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information
        we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time
        such information is used.
      </p>
      <h2>Any Questions?</h2>
      <p>
        If you need clarification on any other terms we use in this Policy,
        please look at the definitions in the <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of
        Use</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies,
        please send us a detailed message to 
        <a href="mailto:support@ditto.com">support@ditto.com</a>, and we will
        try to resolve your concerns.
