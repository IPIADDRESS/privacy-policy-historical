        <p>
          Ditto Technologies, Inc. (“Ditto”) knows that you care
          about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take
          your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about
          our privacy policy.  By visiting the www.ditto.com website and
          domain name, and any other linked pages, features, content, or
          application services offered from time to time by Ditto in
          connection therewith (collectively, the "Website"), or using any of
          our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and
          policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h3>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</h3>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy covers Ditto’s treatment of personally
          identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Ditto gathers
          when you access the Website and when you use Ditto’s services.
          This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Ditto
          does not own or control, or to individuals that Ditto does not
          employ or manage.
        </p>
        <h3>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES DITTO COLLECT?</h3>
        <p>
          The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize
          and improve our services. We collect the following types of
          information from our customers:
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal Information You Provide to Us:<br>
          We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or
          provide to us in any other way.  The types of Personal Information
          collected include your full name, email address, mobile phone
          number, credit card and/or other payment information, IP address,
          browser information, username, password, questionnaires or contest
          entry forms, previous purchases, recommended items from previous
          searches, previous items added to your cart, your Favorites, reviews
          and ratings, product questions and answers, products you share via
          social media networks, text or email, and any other information
          necessary for us to provide our services, and your
          “dittos” (as described more fully below). You can choose
          not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be
          able to take advantage of many of our special features.
          The Personal Information
          you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions,
          sending product updates, and communicating with you about Ditto’s
          products and services, including specials and new features.
        </p>
        Personal Information Collected Automatically:
        <ul>
          <li>
              We receive and store certain types of information whenever you
              interact with our Website or use our services.  Ditto
              automatically receives and records information on our server
              logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie
              information, and the page you requested.
          </li>
          <li>
              Generally, our service automatically collects usage information,
              such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and
              its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many
              people watched a particular show.  Ditto only uses this data in
              aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a
              manner that would identify you personally.  This type of aggregate
              data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of
              the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing
              to as many customers as possible, and improve those services.
              As part of this use of information, we may provide
              aggregate information to our partners about how our customers,
              collectively, use our Website or services.  We share this type of
              statistical data so that our partners also understand how often
              people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide
              you with an optimal online experience. Again, Ditto never
              discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that
              would identify you personally.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          What About The Card You Hold Up against Your Forehead to Add Scale to
          Your Ditto?<br>
          We only ask for you to hold up your credit card for calibration and
          measurement purposes.  We strongly encourage you not to use a credit
          card or other cards with sensitive information on them. That said, we
          take your privacy very seriously, and we take precautions to protect
          you even if you happen to use a card with sensitive information on it
          by erasing that sensitive data from your card before we transmit to
          our server.
        </p>
        <p>
          E-mail Communications:<br>
          We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Ditto
          if your computer supports this type of program. Ditto uses this
          confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful.
          We also compare our customer list to lists received from other
          companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to
          our customers.  When you receive e-mail from Ditto, you can opt
          out of receiving further e-mails by following the included
          instructions to unsubscribe.
        </p>
        What About Cookies?
        <ul>
          <li>
              Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your
              computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems
              to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our
              site are visited and by how many people.  We use cookies to
              enhance visitors’ experiences, to learn more about their use of
              the Website and to improve quality.
          </li>
          <li>
              Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature,
              which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as
              well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser
              software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new
              cookie in a variety of ways.  We strongly recommend that you
              leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable
              you to take advantage of some of our Website’s most attractive
              features.
          </li>
          <li>
              Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by our
              advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow
              the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you
              an online advertisement to compile information about you or
              others who use your computer. This information allows ad
              networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements
              that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy
              Policy covers the use of cookies by Ditto and does not cover
              the use of cookies by any advertisers.
          </li>
         </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3>WILL DITTO SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</h3>
        <p>
          Personal Information about our customers is an integral part of our
          business.  We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to
          anyone.  We share your Personal Information only as described below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We anticipate that we may
          become affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely
          with them.  In certain situations, these businesses may sell items
          to you through the Website.  In other situations, Ditto may provide
          services, or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses.  You
          can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with
          your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that
          is related to such transactions with that affiliated business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on
          our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide
          products or services to you.  Unless we tell you differently,
          Ditto’s agents do not have any right to use Personal Information
          we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby
          consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          User profiles and submissions: User profile information including a
          users’ name, email address, and other information or content you
          enter (“User Submissions”) may be displayed to other users
          to facilitate user interaction within the Website. You may create
          “dittos” of yourself using the Website;
          “dittos” are moving images
          of yourself, which you can use to virtually “try on”
          various products.
          These “dittos,” if you choose to create them,
          will appear in your user profile and will be considered User
          Submissions.  Email
           addresses are used to add new User Submissions to user profiles
           and to communicate through User Submissions. Users’ email addresses
           will not be directly revealed to other users by Ditto, except,
           when the user is "connected" to another user via a shared group
           membership, or an invitation, or if the user has chosen to include
           their email address in their User Profile. Any content you disclose
           online in a manner other uses can view becomes publicly available,
           and can be collected and used by others.
         </p>
         <p>
           Communication in response to User Submissions: As part of the
           Website and services, you will receive from Ditto email and other
           communication relating to your User Submissions. You acknowledge
           and agree that by posting such User Submissions, Ditto may send
           you email and other communication that it determines in its sole
           discretion relate to your User Submissions.<br>
           Promotional Offers: We may send offers to you on behalf of other
           businesses.  However, when we do so, we do not give the other
           business your name and address.  If you do not wish to receive
           these offers, please send an email with your request to
           <a href="mailto:info@ditto.com">info@ditto.com</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
           Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell
           assets.  In these types of transactions, customer information is
           typically one of the business assets that are transferred.
           Moreover, if Ditto, or substantially all of its assets were
           acquired, or in the unlikely event that Ditto goes out of business
           or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the
           assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You
           acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer
           of Ditto may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth
           in this policy.
         </p>
         <p>
           Protection of Ditto and Others: We may release Personal Information
           when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply
           with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other
           agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Ditto,
           our employees, our users, or others.  This includes exchanging
           information with other companies and organizations for fraud
           protection and credit risk reduction.
         </p>
         <p>
           With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified
           when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties,
           and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
         </p>
