    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p>Ditto Technologies, Inc. ("Ditto") knows that you care about how your
      personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy
      seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy
      policy. By visiting the www.dittofit.com website and domain name, and any
      other linked pages, features, content, or application services offered
      from time to time by Ditto in connection therewith (collectively, the
      "Website"), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept
      the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <h2>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy covers Ditto's treatment of personally
      identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Ditto gathers
      when you access the Website and when you use Ditto's services. This
      policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Ditto does not
      own or control, or to individuals that Ditto does not employ or manage.
    </p>
    <h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES DITTO COLLECT?</h2>
    <p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and
      improve our services. We collect the following types of information from
      our customers:
    </p>
    <p class="bold">Personal Information You Provide to Us:</p>
    <p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide
      to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected
      include your full name, email address, mobile phone number, credit card
      and/or other payment information, IP address, browser information,
      username, password, questionnaires or contest entry forms, previous
      purchases, recommended items rom previous searches, previous items added
      to your cart, your Favorites, reviews and ratings, and any other
      information necessary for us to provide our services. You can choose not
      to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to
      take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information
      you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, sending
      product updates, and communicating with you about Ditto's products and
      services, including specials and new features.
    </p>
    <p class="bold">Personal Information Collected Automatically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you
        interact with our Website or use our services. Ditto automatically
        receives and records information on our server logs from your browser
        including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you
        requested.
      </li><li>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such
        as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its
        components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched
        a particular show. Ditto only uses this data in aggregate form, that
        is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify
        you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out
        how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can
        make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and
        improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may
        provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers,
        collectively, use our Website or services. We share this type of
        statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people
        use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an
        optimal online experience. Again, Ditto never discloses aggregate
        information to a partner in a manner that would identify you
        personally.
    </li></ul>
    <p class="bold">E-mail Communications:</p>
    <p>We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Ditto if
      your computer supports this type of program. Ditto uses this confirmation
      to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our
      customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to
      avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. When you receive
      e-mail from Ditto, you can opt out of receiving further e-mails by
      following the included instructions to unsubscribe.
    </p>
    <p class="bold">What About Cookies?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your
        computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to
        recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are
        visited and by how many people.  We use cookies to enhance visitor's
        experiences, to learn more about their use of the Website and to
        improve quality.
      </li><li>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature,
        which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as
        (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you
        to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We
        strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however,
        because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Website's
        most attractive features.
      </li><li>Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by our
        advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad
        server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
        advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your
        computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things,
        deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most
        interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Ditto
        and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>WILL DITTO SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</h2>
    <p>Personal Information about our customers is an integral part of our
    business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We
    share your Personal Information only as described below.
    </p>
    <p><span class="italic">Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control</span>: We
      anticipate that we may become affiliated with a variety of businesses and
      work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses may sell
      items to you through the Website. In other situations, Ditto may provide
      services, or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can
      easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your
      transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related
      to such transactions with that affiliated business.
    </p>
    <p><span class="italic">Agents</span>: We employ other companies and people
      to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with
      them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you
      differently, Ditto's agents do not have any right to use Personal
      Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
      You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above
      purposes.
    </p>
    <p><span class="italic">User profiles</span>: User profile information
      including users' name, email address, and other information you enter
      ("User Submissions") may be displayed to other users to facilitate user
      interaction within the Website. Email addresses are used to add new User
      Submissions to user profiles and to communicate through User Submissions.
      Users' email addresses will not be directly revealed to other users by
      Ditto, except, when the user is "connected" to another user via a shared
      group membership, or an invitation, or if the user has chosen to include
      their email address in their User Profile.
    </p>
    <p><span class="italic">Communication in response to User Submissions</span>:
      As part of the Website and services, you will receive from Ditto email
      and other communication relating to your User Submissions. You
      acknowledge and agree that by posting such User Submissions, Ditto may
      send you email and other communication that it determines in its sole
      discretion relate to your User Submissions.
    </p>
    <p><span class="italic">Promotional Offers</span> : We may send offers to you
      on behalf of other businesses. However, when we do so, we do not give the
      other business your name and address. If you do not wish to receive these
      offers, please send an email with your request to info@dittofit.com
    </p>
    <p><span class="italic">Business Transfers</span>: In some cases, we may
      choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer
      information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred.
      Moreover, if Ditto, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or
      in the unlikely event that Ditto goes out of business or enters
      bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is
      transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
      transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Ditto may continue to use
      your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.
    </p>
    <p><span class="italic">Protection of Ditto and Others</span>: We may release
      Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is
      necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use
      and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of
      Ditto, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging
      information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection
      and credit risk reduction.
    </p>
    <p><span class="italic">With Your Consent</span>: Except as set forth above,
      you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with
      third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this
      information.
    </p>
    <h2>IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?</h2>
    <p>Your Ditto account Personal Information is protected by a password for
      your privacy and security. You need to ensure that there is no
      unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting
      and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your
      computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing
      your account.
    </p>
    <p>Ditto endeavors to protect user information to ensure that user account
      information is kept private, however, Ditto cannot guarantee the security
      of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or
      software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user
      information at any time.
