                    <h2>Pingpin, Inc. Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>
                        Last Updated: March 02, 2011
                    </p>
<p>Pingpin, Inc. ("Pingpin") knows that you take your privacy seriously. We do, too. We are committed to giving you transparency of our privacy practices and control over your data in connection with Pingpin's Service (as defined in Pingpin's Terms of Service). </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers Pingpin's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") and other data that Pingpin gathers when you are accessing Pingpin's Service. The Service is not available to individuals who are younger than 13 years old.</p>
<p>What Personal Information Does Pingpin Collect?</p>
<ol class="termlist">
<li>Personal Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Service or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, phone number, Twitter and/or Facebook usernames, use information regarding your use of our Service, and browser information. We automatically receive your location when you use the Service. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Service, improving the content of the Service, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. We may also draw upon this Personal Information in order to adapt the Services of our community to your needs, to research the effectiveness of our network and Services, and to develop new tools for the community.
</li><li>Information Collected Automatically: When you use the Service, Pingpin automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser or mobile platform, including your location, IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. We treat this data as non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. Pingpin only uses this data in aggregate form. We may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site, so that our partners may also understand how often people use their services and our Service.
</li></ol>
<p>How is My Information Shared? Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. Pingpin may share your Personal Information only as described below.</p>
<ol class="termlist">
<li>Friends: Your "friends" can see the location and time of each of your check-ins, first name and last initial, email, phone number, photo, hometown, favorites and trophies, links to your Twitter and Facebook accounts (if you have connected those accounts to your Pingpin account), a list of your friends, comments you write. Individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in posts, comments or other content (location or otherwise) that you create in the Service.
</li><li>Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Our agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us, and they provide a comparable level of protection for your Personal Information.
</li><li>Information Shared with Everyone: One of the primary reasons people use Pingpin is to share content with others.  Information such as your name and photo, your location at the time where you use the service, a list of your friends, and the comments and posts you write is shared by default with the Pingpin community.
</li></ol>
<p>Pingpin Features</p>
<p>The Pingpin service also has the following features that may allow you to share your information with others. For each of these features, the information available to friends and others, our default user settings, and how to alter the default settings, is available within your user settings within the application.  Please remember that if you choose to provide personal information using certain features of the Service, that information may be available to the wider Pingpin community, or may be published on the Pingpin website, which is subject to indexing by third party search engines.</p>
<ol class="termlist">
<li>Connecting to your Twitter, Facebook or Foursquare accounts
</li><li>Searching for friends
</li><li>Inviting others to join Pingpin
</li><li>Writing and posting comments and recommendations
</li></ol>
<p>Sharing with Partners, in connection with business transfers, and for the protection of Pingpin and others:</p>
<ol class="termlist">
<li>Our Partners: In addition to the data sharing described above, we enter into relationships with a variety of entities and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses sell items or provide promotions to you through Pingpin's Service. In other situations, Pingpin provides services, or sells products jointly with these businesses. You can easily recognize when one of these businesses is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that business, unless you have elected not to be solicited by marketing partners during the registration process or through the account settings page.
</li><li>Business Transfers: If Pingpin or substantially all of its assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that Pingpin goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
</li><li>Protection of Pingpin and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law, including laws outside your country of residence; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Pingpin, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations (including outside of your country of residence) for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
</li></ol>
<p>Adding Your Home Address As A Venue: You should be aware that if you or your friends add your home as a new venue in the Service database and that information is published on the Service (for example, via a user checking in to that home venue), that information may be available to others and may be published by third parties without our control. To request removal of a venue from the Pingpin database (including your home address) please email us at privacy@ditto.me</p><p>
</p><p>Email Communications: If you do not want to receive commercial email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference during the registration process or by making a modification on your account settings page or through the â€˜settings' tab on our website once you're logged into the service. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as notices regarding this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Pingpin Service, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes. We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Pingpin if your computer supports this type of program. Pingpin uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and improve our service.</p>
