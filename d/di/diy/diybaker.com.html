			<h2>OAR's Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of operating this site, we may gather certain types of information about users of the site, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather and what we do with it. OAR has created this Privacy Policy to explain why we collect particular information and how we will protect your personal privacy within our website. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the website located at&nbsp;http://www.hireautism.org.</p>
<p>In order to fully understand your rights we encourage you to read this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use. OAR&nbsp;reserves the right at any time and without notice to change this Privacy Policy simply by posting such changes on our site. Any such change will be effective immediately upon posting. Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, this Privacy Policy notifies you of:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>What personally identifiable information of yours is collected through the site</li>
<li>Who collects such information</li>
<li>How such information is used</li>
<li>With whom your information may be shared</li>
<li>What choices you have regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information</li>
<li>What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under our control</li>
<li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in your information</li>
<li>Questions regarding this statement shoudl be directed to OAR by emailing us at <a href="mailto:oar@researchautism.org">oar@researchautism.org</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>What Information We Collect and How We Use That Information</h4>
<p>Our registration forms require users to provide contact information that may include name, email address, phone number, and similar information. This information is stored in our secure content management system (CMS), which is accessible only to authorized personnel. We do not request or store sensitive information from our visitors, such as credit card or social security numbers.</p>
<p>Our analytics software collects information regarding visitor traffic, downloads, user interactions on desktop and mobile, and traffic sources.</p>
<p>All stored information is used only to contact Hire Autism users should they request support, or to perform internal analytics assessments. Such assessments are neither public nor are they released to other organizations. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Use of "Cookies"</h4>
<p>Our website&nbsp;may use cookies to enhance your experience while using the&nbsp;site. Cookies are pieces of information that some websites&nbsp;transfer to the computer that is browsing that website&nbsp;and are used for record-keeping purposes at many Web sites. Use of cookies makes web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving your passwords, your personal preferences regarding your use of the particular website, and makes sure you don’t see the same ad repeatedly. Many consider the use of cookies to be an industry standard.</p>
<p>Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function properly when you view them.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Privacy Protection Procedures</h4>
<p>Protecting your information is important to us. At OAR, we have implemented appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures to help keep your information secure, accurate, current, and complete. In addition, all OAR employees with access to personal information obtained on the OAR website are bound to adhere to this policy as part of their contract with OAR. OAR protects your personal information in a variety of ways. For certain services, such as Sign Up, only minimal personal information is required, such as email addresses. In addition, personal information provided to our donations sites is encrypted. We also protect that account information by placing it on a secure portion of our site that is only accessible by authorized personnel. All information provided to OAR’s donation site is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt or scramble data before you send it to us. We also protect Hire Autism account information by placing it on a secure portion of our site that is only accessible by certain qualified OAR employees. If you choose, other Hire Autism users may view your personal profile information. Unfortunately however, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information. Any such transmission is done at your own risk &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
