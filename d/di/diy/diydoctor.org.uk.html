<li>to allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so; and</li>

</ol>
<h2>Mailing List</h2>
<p>Our email mailing list is hosted and managed by MailerMailer whose website can be found at <a href="http://www.mailermailer.com/" title="Mass mailing facilities from MailerMailer">www.mailermailer.com </a>.</p> 
<p>In our email messages to you which may be distributed through this mailing list, we may provide information from third party providers of products and services which we think may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>If you have subscribed to our email mailing list, but do not wish to receive it in future, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions contained in each emailed newsletter.</p>
<h2>Forum Area </h2>
<p>This policy explains in detail how “diydoctor.org.uk DIY and Home Improvement Forums” along with its affiliated companies (hereinafter “we”, “us”, “our”, “diydoctor.org.uk DIY and Home Improvement Forums”, “http://www.diydoctor.org.uk/forums”) and phpBB (hereinafter “they”, “them”, “their”, “phpBB software”, “www.phpbb.com”, “phpBB Group”, “phpBB Teams”) use any information collected during any session of usage by you (hereinafter “your information”).</p>
<p>Your information is collected via two ways. Firstly, by browsing “diydoctor.org.uk DIY and Home Improvement Forums” will cause the phpBB software to create a number of cookies, which are small text files that are downloaded on to your computer’s web browser temporary files. The first two cookies just contain a user identifier (hereinafter “user-id”) and an anonymous session identifier (hereinafter “session-id”), automatically assigned to you by the phpBB software. A third cookie will be created once you have browsed topics within “diydoctor.org.uk DIY and Home Improvement Forums” and is used to store which topics have been read, thereby improving your user experience.</p>
<p>We may also create cookies external to the phpBB software whilst browsing “diydoctor.org.uk DIY and Home Improvement Forums”, though these are outside the scope of this document which is intended to only cover the pages created by the phpBB software. The second way in which we collect your information is by what you submit to us. This can be, and is not limited to: posting as an anonymous user (hereinafter “anonymous posts”), registering on “diydoctor.org.uk DIY and Home Improvement Forums” (hereinafter “your account”) and posts submitted by you after registration and whilst logged in (hereinafter “your posts”).</p>
<p>Your account will at a bare minimum contain a uniquely identifiable name (hereinafter “your user name”), a personal password used for logging into your account (hereinafter “your password”) and a personal, valid e-mail address (hereinafter “your e-mail”). Your information for your account at “diydoctor.org.uk DIY and Home Improvement Forums” is protected by data-protection laws applicable in the country that hosts us. Any information beyond your user name, your password, and your e-mail address required by “diydoctor.org.uk DIY and Home Improvement Forums” during the registration process is either mandatory or optional, at the discretion of “diydoctor.org.uk DIY and Home Improvement Forums”. In all cases, you have the option of what information in your account is publicly displayed. Furthermore, within your account, you have the option to opt-in or opt-out of automatically generated e-mails from the phpBB software.</p>
<p>Your password is ciphered (a one-way hash) so that it is secure. However, it is recommended that you do not reuse the same password across a number of different websites. Your password is the means of accessing your account at “diydoctor.org.uk DIY and Home Improvement Forums”, so please guard it carefully and under no circumstance will anyone affiliated with “diydoctor.org.uk DIY and Home Improvement Forums”, phpBB or another 3rd party, legitimately ask you for your password. Should you forget your password for your account, you can use the “I forgot my password” feature provided by the phpBB software. This process will ask you to submit your user name and your e-mail, then the phpBB software will generate a new password to reclaim your account.</p>
<h2>Advertisements</h2>
<p>In order to bring you offers and information that may be of interest to you, we may allow third parties to place advertisements on the website. If you choose to click on any advertisement, the advertiser may collect non personally identifiable information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information.</p>
<h2>Disclosure of your information</h2>
<p>8.1 We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;</li> 
<li>if DIY Doctor Limited or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets; and</li>
<li>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply any agreements we have entered into with you or any third party; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of DIY Doctor Limited, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Your rights</h2>
<p>9.1 The Act gives you the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data.&nbsp; You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:office@diydoctor.org.uk" title="Contact DIY Doctor on office@diydoctor.org.uk">office@diydoctor.org.uk</a>.</p>
<p>9.2 The Website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of third parties.&nbsp; If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.&nbsp; Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>
<h2>Access to information</h2>
<p>The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.</p>
<h2>Changes to our privacy policy</h2>
<p>Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>Questions, comments and requests regarding this privacy policy are welcomed and should be addressed to <a href="mailto:office@diydoctor.org.uk" title="Email DIY Doctor on office@diydoctor.org.uk">office@diydoctor.org.uk</a></p>
