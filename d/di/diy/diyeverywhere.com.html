<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><u>PRIVACY POLICY</u></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-style:italic;">Effective May 24, 2018</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This website (collectively, "This website" or
"we"), under parent company SFG Media Group, LLC, respects the privacy rights of our online users and is
committed to protecting the personal information collected about or provided by
you. We have adopted this Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy")
to guide how we store, collect, manage and use the personal information you
provided in connection with the Service.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to
information submitted and collected by This website through use of the Service in any way, but does not apply to information that may be collected
offline or collected through any other method including your use of any web
site This website's affiliated entities may operate. Moreover, this Privacy
Policy applies to the Service, but <b>not</b> to websites maintained by other
companies or organizations to which we may provide links. When you visit
these websites, this Privacy Policy no longer applies. We are therefore not
responsible for the content or activities provided or created on such sites.<br>
<br>
<em>By using and accessing the Service, you
signify your assent to our Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this
Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service. We reserve the right to make changes
to this Privacy Policy. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we
will notify you by posting the change in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary,
give you additional choices regarding such change. Please check back from time
to time to ensure that you are aware of these changes. Your continued use of the
Service will signify your acceptance of these changes.</em></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><em><u><span style="font-style:normal">Information Collected
</span></u></em></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">In order to give you the best experience in use of the
Service, This website may obtain information from you through your Service registration, your access and participation in
message boards, comments, etc on the Service; your email of a question to our customer service
desk; or your purchase of a virtual product of any type. Further, we may ask
you for personal information (such as name, phone number, or email address) if you choose to
sign up for any particular Service we offer (such as a newsletter or reminder
service). In all such cases, the information provided will not be disclosed to
third parties and will be used solely for the purpose of providing you with the
Service.  When information is collected in this way, you may update or remove your information
through the user interfaces provided within the Service.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Use of Information Collected</u></p>

<p>We collect and process personal information as allowed under applicable law, under the following legal bases:</p>

<ul>
  <li> The consent you provide to us;
  </li><li> As necessary in the performance of the contract we have with you; and
  </li><li> The legitimate interests of This website, a third party or yourself where those interests do not override your fundamental rights and freedoms regarding your personal data.
</li></ul>

<p class="MsoNormal">
The information you provide to This website will be used for the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> to ensure that content from our site is presented to you in the most effective manner and to personalize your visit to our site;
  </li><li> to enable us to continuously enhance the Service, to serve advertising, and to provide to you information, products or services which we feel may be of interest to you (which also helps keep our service free)
</li></ul>

<p class="MsoNormal">This website does
not rent, lease, loan, sell, voluntarily distribute or redistribute your
personal information to any unaffiliated third parties.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This website may use your email address or other personal
information to send you a newsletter, marketing or advertising materials, or service
announcements that tell you about updates to our Privacy Policy, changes in
pricing, changes to our online service or customer service policies, and other
related service changes. This website will not voluntarily disclose this personal
information to unaffiliated third parties for any other purpose. Information
collected from you is solely
used in the operation of the Service. For example, personal and/or demographic
information collected through one of the activities set forth <b><span style="color:#333333">above</span></b> may be used for our internal
demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online products and
services we provide you and better meet your needs. Additionally, we may use
information that we collected to enforce our rights under our Terms of Service.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">No matter what method we use to collect information and no
matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed
reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate
business objectives, and such information will not be provided to any third
parties.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Consistent with This website's Copyright and Intellectual
Property Policy and in its sole discretion, we reserve the right to remove any
of your personal information or content from the Service if we receive a notice
of intellectual property infringement or other complaint.<br>
<br>
<b>Note about Message Boards</b><br>
Note that whenever you give out personal information in public areas such as on
our message board, that information can be collected and used by people you do
not know. While we strive to protect those who wish to participate in these
activities, we cannot guarantee the security and privacy of any information
that you post in these areas and you acknowledge this fact.<br>
<br>

<u>Other Disclosure of Your Personal Information</u></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Notwithstanding any other terms of this Privacy Policy, we
may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required
to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law enforcement or
other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud,
intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may
expose you or us to legal liability.<br>
<br>
In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy,
or other similar event, customer information may be transferred to This website's
successor or assign, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable
law.<br>
<br>
We may also share aggregate information about our visitors to our Service. For
example, we may say a particular audience is X% female and Y%
male. This data is used to customize the content and advertising of our Service
to deliver better experience for our visitors. It can also help to tailor our
products and services to meet the needs of our customers.<br>
<br>
We may send to your web browser, directly or in directly, advertisements you
see when you visit our Service. However, we may allow other companies, called
third party ad servers, to serve advertisements within our Service. This
Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities of, these
other companies. If you want to prevent a third party ad server from sending
or reading cookies on your computer, you must visit the company's web sites
individually and opt-out.  More information regarding this can be found below.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Not Providing Information</u></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">If you choose not to submit personal information when
requested, you may not be able to use many of the features the Service offers.</p>


<p><u>Passive Means of Information Collection (Cookies, IP addresses, etc.)</u></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cookies, Local Storage, and Other Similar Technologies</b><br>
We may use cookies, local storage, and other similar technologies in the operation of the Service. "Cookies" and "Local Storage" are
small bits of record-keeping information that sites often store on a user's
computer. Cookies and local storage are typically used to quickly identify a user's computer and
to "remember" things about the user's visit. For example, we may use
cookies or local storage to keep track of your preferences and your username and password. Information
contained in a cookie or local storage may be linked to your personal information for this
purpose. You can disable cookies or local storage, or set your browser to alert you when cookies
are being sent to your computer, although this may affect your ability to use
many of the features of the Service.  You can remove this data anytime, by clearing the cookies 
and local storage data bound to This website's domain from your browser.<br>
<br>
<b>IP Addresses</b><br>
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is used by computers on the
network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. Although
we do not generally collect IP addresses, we may collect and use your IP address
when we feel it is necessary to protect our service, websites, customers, or
others.<br>
<br>
If you use the Service, we may collect other unique numbers associated
with a computer's identity on a network.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Log Files</b><br>
Other information that may be passively collected by This website is in the form of
logs - files that record website activity, including how many "hits"
a particular web page is getting (a.k.a. "navigational data"). These
entries are generated anonymously, and enable us to gather statistics about
article popularity, assess overall website activity, track interest in
advertised sales, and maintain website security. We also use the log file
entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can
constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log files are used
internally only, and may be combined with data collected via cookies to help us
aggregate usage patterns of registered users.</p>


<p><u>Privacy Policy and Third Party Web Sites, Links, Advertisements and Services</u></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">You should be aware that while you are using our Service,
you may be directed to other sites that are beyond our control and for which we
are not responsible. Additionally, third parties provide advertisements and
offer other products and services to you when you are using our Service, which
may receive your IP address or other technology such as cookies, web beacons
and the like. By using the Service, you consent to such use by third parties
of your personal information, which is subject to the privacy policies of these
third parties.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">You should consult the privacy policies of these third
parties for more detailed information.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Third party vendors, including Facebook, Google, Amazon, AppNexus, OpenX, Exponential and Nativo use cookies to serve ads based on prior visits to This website or other websites on the Internet.

</p><p class="MsoNormal"><u>Policy Regarding Children Under 13</u></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">We do not knowingly collect personal information such as
name and email address from children under 13. From time to time, certain
portions of our Service may allow all users (including children under 13) to

their age or parental permission. In the event that we learn that we have
collected personal information from a child under the age of thirteen, we will
delete the information as quickly as possible.<br>

<p class="MsoBodyText">We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of
children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children's use of
online activities regularly.</p>
