CAPITALIZED TERMS NOTE DEFINED HEREIN HAVE THE MEANING GIVEN TO THEM IN THE DIGITALFLARE TERMS OF SERVICE, WHICH IS AVAILABLE AT http://digitalflare.io/terms.html</p>

<p>At DigitalFlare Ltd. (the "Company" or "we"), we recognize that privacy is important. This policy applies to all of the software (including the Implementation Code and DigitalFlare Software), related technology, information, content, services, tools, features and functionality offered by the Company and/or its subsidiaries and/or affiliated companies on our website available at: http://digitalflare.io (collectively, the "Services") and covers how PII that the Company collects and receives, including in respect of any use of the Services, is treated. If you have any questions about this policy, please feel free to contact us at support@digitalflare.io.</p>

<h4>1. Scope</h4>
<p>We act as a service provider to operators of other websites. To the extent that we collect PII about you on behalf of a customer, that PII is subject to that customer's privacy policy and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such customer.</p>

<h4>2. Information We Collect and How We Use It </h4>
<p>Unless stated otherwise, the Company will not share, sell, auction off or give away your PII to any third-party or other organization without first obtaining your prior written consent.
In order to provide our Services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
<ul>
     <li>Information that Sites that Register to the Services Provide Directly to Us. For some features of the Services, including, but not limited to, registration and access to the Services, we may ask you for PII, including, but not limited to: name, email address, telephone number, and demographics. 
</li><li>Information We Collect From Users of Sites (Sites that have registered to the Services) ("Users"). When Users visit the Sites, some information is automatically collected. This includes the following information:  IP address, cookie information, regional and language settings, operating system, device model, device ID and other unique identifiers from User's computer or device, the physical location of User's device (if User has permitted its mobile or other location-aware device to transmit location data), and software and hardware attributes. Our systems may automatically record and store technical information regarding the method and nature of User's use of the Services and web log data, including, without limitation, which pages or widgets of the Services the Users view and the dates and times on which they viewed such pages or widgets, impressions, the number of views they get and any actions they make in the Services (including, but not limited to, what products and/or items they looked at). We use the User's IP address to help with server problem diagnosis and to administer the Services. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your computer or device on a network, or in this case, the Internet. The User's IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information. We may also perform IP lookups to determine which domain the User is coming from (i.e: aol.com, yourcompany.com) to more accurately gauge our users' demographics.
</li><li>Personal Information. We process your PII only for specific and limited purposes, including the provision of the Services. We ask only for PII that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for those purposes. Some of these purposes may include to inform you of new services and features we will be providing, to send you requested information and additional materials in respect of the Services, for promotional purposes and market research, and internally to help us improve our Services and to help resolve any problems. 
</li><li>Traffic data collected through the Services. In addition to the information we collect as described above, we may use technology to collect information about the use of the Services. For example, our systems may automatically record and store browser information, search history, exit point, use time, platform type, operating system information, number of clicks and cookies. This technology does not identify you personally, it simply enables us to compile statistics about our visitors and their use of the Services. The Services contain hyperlinks to other pages, widgets and features on the Services. We may use technology to track how often these links are used and which pages, widgets and features of the Services our visitors choose to view. Again this technology does not identify you personally it simply enables us to compile statistics about the use of these hyperlinks. 
</li><li>Cookies. In order to store your credentials when you contact us, personalize your experience and collect and analyze the anonymous data described herein, we may use temporary cookies that remain on your device or computer for a limited period of time. We may also use persistent cookies that remain on your device or computer in order to record any content you may have gained access to by using Services.  Cookies by themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. A cookie is a small piece of information which is sent to and stored on your device or computer. Cookies do not damage your device or computer. Most browsers or devices may allow you to block cookies but you may not be able to use some features on the Services if you block them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie (this enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not).  
</li><li>Clear GIFs, Pixel Tags and other technologies. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are embedded invisibly on web pages. We or our service providers may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Services to track the activities of visitors to our site, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Services. We or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our users, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.

</li><li>We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive PII.
</li><li>We provide PII to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing PII on our behalf in Israel and/or abroad. We require that these parties agree to process such PII based on our instructions and in compliance with this notice and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
</li><li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such PII is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable agreements and/or their terms, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of the Company, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. 
</li><li>If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets.

</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Information security</h4>

<ul>
	 <li>We strive to maintain the reliability, accuracy, completeness and currency of PII that we collect and to protect the privacy and security of our users. We keep your PII only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.
</li><li>We limit access to PII about you to employees, contractors and agents who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that PII. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
</li><li>We have physical, electronic, and procedural security measures and safeguards to reasonably protect PII. Our servers and our databases are protected by industry standard security technology, such as industry standard firewalls and password protection.
</li><li>Although we cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction of data, we try to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Data integrity, accessing and updating personal information</h4>

</li><li>We ask individual users to identify themselves and the PII requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The Company regularly reviews its compliance with this policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this policy or our treatment of PII by contacting us as provided above.
