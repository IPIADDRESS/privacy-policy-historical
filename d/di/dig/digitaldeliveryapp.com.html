<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><b>Last updated: June 2018</b></p>
<p>At SendOwl, we respect your privacy. In accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation, we have enhanced our Privacy Policy and encourage you to read it before submitting any personal data to us through our site. Concept Den Ltd will be the data controller of your personal data.</p>
<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>For all visitors to our site, we collect aggregated information on pages viewed including IP address, timestamps, logins. For subscribers and customers, we additionally collect registration information including name, email address, telephone number; billing information including address; and information required to sell goods.</p>
<p>For buyers who buy something that is delivered by SendOwl we collect information relating to any transactions recorded by us or returned by the payment gateway including name, email address, billing and shipping address. We do not record buyer card or bank details.</p>
<p>We use Stripe for payment, analytics, and other business services. Stripe collects identifying information about the devices that connect to its services. Stripe uses this information to operate and improve the services it provides to us, including for fraud detection. You can learn more about Stripe and read its privacy policy at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stripe.com/privacy">www.stripe.com/privacy</a></p>
<h2>Legal basis</h2>
<p>Billing information is recorded as it is necessary to comply with our contractual obligations when providing our service to subscribers and customers.</p>
<p>We process information about our visitors for the legitimate business interests of developing our site to ensure a better experience for our visitors. We also obtain registration information based on the legitimate interest of business administration. When processing your personal data for our legitimate interests, we take appropriate measures to ensure that the interests we pursue are balanced with your interests, rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>With your consent, we may use your personal data to send you marketing materials, except as otherwise permitted by applicable law.</p>
<h2>Purposes</h2>
<p>The data recorded is used for the following purposes:
</p><ul>
<li>to respond to your enquiry, ask a question, contact you about your request or other reasons related to offering and improving our services;</li>
<li>provide checkout capabilities on our site;</li>
<li>to enable us to communicate with you and sellers;</li>
<li>send you our monthly newsletter if you have signed up;</li>
<li>for buyers who buy something that is delivered by SendOwl we collect data so we can provide them with access to their purchase;</li>
<li>to protect against, identify and help prevent fraud, unauthorized activity, claims and other liabilities; and</li>
<li>to fulfil our legal and financial obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Your personal data is not shared or sold, in raw or aggregate form, unless either required by law officials (subject to our Terms and Conditions). We have no relationships with ad server companies.</p>
<p>If we plan to use the personal data that you provide to use for any other purpose, we will let you know what this purpose is and our legal basis for doing so.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. Cookies may use your IP address, timestamps, logins. Information collected from cookies is used by us to evaluate the effectiveness of our website, analyse trends, and administer our website. This allows us to determine such things as which parts of our website are most visited and difficulties our visitors may experience in accessing our website.</p>
<p>We use cookies for authentication (logging you into your account), site functionality (the shopping cart, the affiliate scheme and the referral scheme), to analyse our site performance (via Google Analytics) and for advertising management (SendOwl adverts you may see around the internet). These cookies record session information on the device you're using to access our website.</p>
<p>For cookies that are essential, your consent is not required. For the use of the other types of cookies described in this policy, we do ask you for your consent when you first visit our website. You can withdraw your consent or remove these cookies at any time via your browser preferences but you will have to re-login to the SendOwl site if you remove the authentication cookie. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and remove them, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. To explore what cookie settings are available to you, look in the "preferences" or "options" section of your browser's menu.</p>
<h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
<p>SendOwl collects personal data and stores it securely. We also use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary equipment required to run the service. Specifically: Cloudflare, Amazon Web Service, Rackspace, MailGun, Google Analytics, FreeAgent, HelpScout, Stripe and MailChimp. We have contracts in place with our third party vendors that require them to use personal data only as necessary to perform services on our behalf and to implement appropriate security measures as required by law.</p>
<h2>Retention and Withdrawal</h2>
<p>We retain your personal data as long as needed for the purposes for which we collected it, plus a reasonable period to take into account the applicable statute of limitation period or to comply with legal requirements.</p>
<h2>Data Transfer</h2>
<p>We may transfer your personal data to recipients in countries other than the country in which the personal data originally was collected. Those countries may not offer the same level of protection to your personal data. When we transfer your personal data to recipients outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we will comply with applicable legal requirements by providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal data, including by (i) entering into the European Commission’s EU Standard Contractual Clauses with the data recipients, or (ii) verifying that the recipient has implemented Binding Corporate Rules or has adhered to the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. To obtain a copy of the safeguards we have put in place, please contact us as indicated below.</p>
<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>We protect your personal data which we collect and store by implementing administrative, technical and physical security measures. These measures ensure an appropriate level of security and confidentiality for your personal data.</p>
<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>If you would like to unsubscribe from receiving our newsletter, you can click on the “unsubscribe” link included in our email or contact us as indicated below.</p>
<p>Subject to applicable law, you may have certain rights in relation to your personal data. These rights are as follows:
</p><ul>
<li>Request access to your personal data.</li>
<li>Request correction of your personal data.</li>
<li>Request erasure of your personal data.</li>
<li>Object to the processing of your personal data for reasons relating to your particular situation.</li>
<li>Request restriction of processing your personal data.</li>
<li>Request to export the personal data that we process based on our contract with you or your consent and transfer it to another company (if technically feasible).</li>
<li>Withdraw any consent you have previously provided to us.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us using the details in the ‘Contact Us’ section.</p>
<p>If you are not happy with our response, you can contact the ICO in the UK, or other data protection regulator in your country. Important note: if you are a buyer who has been delivered a product via SendOwl you will need to contact the product seller regarding your data rights. SendOwl acts as a data processor and it is the seller who must delete your data from SendOwl as your purchase contract is with them not us.</p>
<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>This policy may be periodically updated. Any changes will be notified by email or by a message on the service seen when you first login. Please review carefully before submitting personal data to our site. The date the policy was last updated is indicated at the top of this page.</p>
