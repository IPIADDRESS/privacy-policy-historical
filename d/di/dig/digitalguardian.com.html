According to said Recital (49), network and<br>information security means the ability of a network or of an information system to resist events, attacks or<br>unlawful or malicious actions that could compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of<br>stored or transmitted data, or the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via those networks and<br>systems.</p><p><br>Both as an organization in our own right, and as a provider of cybersecurity technologies and services which may<br>include hosted and managed computer emergency and security incident response services, it is in our legitimate<br>interests as well as in our customers’, as laid down in Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, to collect and process Personal<br>Data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring the security of our own, and<br>of our customers’ networks and information systems. This includes the development of threat intelligence<br>resources aimed at maintaining and improving on an ongoing basis the ability of networks and systems to resist<br>unlawful or malicious actions and other harmful events (“cyber-threats”). The Personal Data we process for said<br>purposes includes, without limitation, network traffic data related to cyber-threats such as:</p><p><br>• sender email addresses (e.g., of sources of SPAM);<br>• recipient email addresses (e.g., of victims of targeted email cyberattacks);<br>• reply-to email addresses (e.g., as configured by cybercriminals sending malicious email);<br>• filenames and execution paths (e.g., of malicious or otherwise harmful executable files attached to<br>emails);<br>• URLs and associated page titles (e.g., of web pages broadcasting or hosting malicious or otherwise<br>harmful contents); and/or<br>• IP addresses (e.g., of web servers and connected devices involved in the generation, distribution,<br>conveyance, hosting, caching or other storage of cyber-threats such as malicious or otherwise harmful<br>contents).</p><p>Depending on the context in which such data is collected, it may contain Personal Data concerning you or any<br>other data subjects. However, in such cases, we will process the data concerned only to the extent strictly<br>necessary and proportionate to the purposes of detecting, blocking, reporting (by removing any personally<br>identifiable elements) and mitigating the cyber-threats of concern to you, and to all organizations relying on our<br>products and services to secure their networks and systems. When processing Personal Data in this context, we<br>will not seek to identify a data subject unless strictly indispensable to the remediation of the cyber-threats<br>concerned, or required by law.</p><p><br>If you believe that your Personal Data was unduly collected or is unduly processed by Digital Guardian for such<br>purposes, please refer to the “Your Rights” and “Contact Us” sections below. Please be aware that if it is<br>determined that Personal Data concerning you is processed by Digital Guardian because it is necessary for the<br>detection, blocking or mitigation of convicted cyber-threats, in line with GDPR Article 21(1), objection, rectification<br>or erasure requests may be rejected. It is our compelling legitimate interests to protect our organization and our<br>customers from cyber threats, and therefore our interest may override your objection, rectification or erasure<br>requests until you demonstrate the measures necessary to dissociate your Personal Data from any identified<br>cyber-threat.</p><p><br><strong>Marketing and Community Networking</strong></p><p>Digital Guardian has a legitimate interest in promoting our commercial offerings and to optimize the delivery of<br>communications to that effect to our customers and audiences that are most likely to find them relevant.

This could involve in particular assigning<br>relative cybersecurity reputation scores to IP addresses and URLs based on objective cyber-threat indicators<br>measured by our cyber-threat detection engines. Such indicators may be for instancethe determination that<br>malicious or otherwise harmful contents are hosted at a given URL, or are emanating from a given IP address. Such<br>automatically-assigned reputation scores may be leveraged by you, by Digital Guardian, by our partners and by<br>other customers to detect, block and mitigate the identified cyber-threats. They could therefore result in our<br>products and services blocking network traffic coming from or going to such URLs and IP addresses. No such<br>processing is intended to produce any other effect than protecting you, Digital Guardian, our partners and our<br>other customers from cyber-threats. Should you nevertheless consider that such automated processing is unduly<br>affecting you in a significant way, please contact directly the relevant data controller whose use of our products<br>and services is thus impacting you. In case that data controller is Digital Guardian, please refer to the “Your Privacy<br>Rights” and “Contact Us” sections of this Statement to raise your concerns and to seek our help in finding a<br>satisfactory solution.</p><p><br><strong>How We Disclose Your Personal Data</strong></p><p>We do not sell, lease, rent or give away your Personal Data.
