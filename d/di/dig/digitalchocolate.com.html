<h3><strong><em>Via Cookies and Web Beacons</em></strong></h3>
<p><b>The Site uses “cookies,” which are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Our cookies are used to either identify you as a returning customer or improve the experience on our Service.</b><br>
<b>Third parties that place advertising on our Service may also use cookies. Since the third party advertising companies tag your computer with a number, they will be able to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement.&nbsp; These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Service in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</b><br>
Digital Chocolate uses “Clear GIFs” to analyze traffic on the Site, and within HTML e-mails to determine whether the e-mails have been opened. Clear GIFs (also called Web Beacons, or Web Bugs) are small images embedded on web pages and in email communications.</p>

<h3><strong><em>Third Party Tools</em></strong></h3>
<p>The Service may also contain third party tracking tools from service providers, examples of which include Magic Box, Flurry and AdMob.&nbsp; Digital Chocolate may use these third parties’ APIs/SDKs in our Service, which may enable these third parties to analyze user information.&nbsp; While these third parties may have access to your personal information in connection with the performance of services for Digital Chocolate, they may not use such information for any purpose other than providing their services.</p>

<p><strong><em>Offer Walls</em></strong></p>
<p>The Service may display an “offer wall” that is hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall allows third party advertisers to provide virtual currency to users in exchange for completing an offer, fulfilling a survey or otherwise interacting with an advertisement. These are offers made by third party advertisers; not by Digital Chocolate.</p>
<p>These offers may be targeted to you based on certain information, such as your geographic area or other demographic information. After clicking on one of these advertisements, you will no longer be on a site hosted by Digital Chocolate orthe SNS.</p>
<p>We may need to share your user ID number with the offer wall provider.

Once you complete an offer, you will then return to Digital Chocolate’s Service.</p>
<p><strong><em>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</em></strong></p>
<p>We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Digital Chocolate, such as to determine, bill and collect amounts owed to us, or to protect the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>

<p>Digital Chocolate may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personal information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other Disclosures</em></strong></p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Digital Chocolate may share your information when you agree to our sharing your information with other third parties for their own marketing purposes subject to their separate privacy policies.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may share aggregate or anonymous information about you with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.</p>

<h2>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h2>
<p>All users may review, update, correct or delete the information in their registration profile by changing the applicable information in their account settings or, for Services that are hosted on a SNS , by changing the applicable information in their profile page. If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request if we do not have any legal obligation to retain the record. See below for privacy contact information.</p>
<h2>Phishing</h2>
<p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to Digital Chocolate. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.</p>
<h3>How We Protect Your Information</h3>
<p>We have put reasonable security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, destruction and alteration of information under our control. For example, when you access your Account Information, we use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol to encrypt information you input before it is sent to us.<br>
<b>Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure. Although we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we have procedures and security features in place to try to prevent unauthorized access.</b></p>
