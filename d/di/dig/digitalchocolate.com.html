</p><h2>Your Privacy Matters to Us</h2>
<br>
Welcome to Digital Chocolate, Inc. ("Digital Chocolate"). Your privacy is important to us. We have created this policy, which explains what personally identifiable information we collect from you on our Web sites (the "Site") and in our mobile or PC software applications and any related services and how we use and disclose that information. We reserve the right to change this policy at any time. If we decide to change this policy, we will post those changes on this page and update the date at the top of the page. The changes will be effective when posted, and your continued use of the Sites or our mobile or PC applications after the effective date of such change constitutes your consent to the collection practices described in such revised statement. Please check this page on a regular basis and whenever you use this Site so that you remain aware of what information we collect and how we use it. <br>
When we use the term "personal information" in this policy, we are referring to personally identifiable information that specifically identifies an individual (such as an individual's first and last name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other account number), and information about that individual or such individual's activities or preferences when such information is directly linked to personally identifying information. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Sites or categories of Site users, from which any personal information has been removed. For example, information that forty-seven percent of the Sites' registered users identify themselves as male, but without identifying any specific individuals as male, is aggregate information. We collect aggregate data for a number of purposes, including to help us understand trends and user needs so that we can better consider new publications, products and services, and tailor existing publications, products and services to user desires. This policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information.
