If we decide to modify our Policy of Confidentiality, we upload the new version on our Web sites, by updating the date contained in its last paragraph. You are invited to consult the present Policy of Confidentiality from time to time in order to be informed about possible modifications. The terms of this Policy of Confidentiality do not include any damage to the provisions of a possible contract which you could have concluded with us and which prevails upon the terms of this Policy of Confidentiality.</p>
<h4>1. Commitment of Confidentiality</h4>
<p>DIGIDNA does not collect and does not process any Personal Data that you did not provide us specifically, voluntarily and consciously. We guarantee you that our staff complies with the strict standards of safety and confidentiality and we ensure you that the processing of your Personal Data is carried out with total respect of the international legislations recognized on the data protection.</p>

<p>The majority of our services do not require any suscription, which enables you to visit our Websites without telling us who you are. However, certain services may require a suscription. When you subscribe, you may be asked to fill-in certain fields in forms (some of them are mandatory, other are optional), and to choose a user name and a password.

For example, we must collect and use your Personal Data to provide you with our services, to invoice those which you request, to market other ones that we believe are likely to interest you, to send you newsletters or to communicate with you for any other purpose. In addition, we can use your Personal Data for assessing the efficiency of our services and improving them, for the benefit of our visitors and our customers, for our internal statistics or other requirements of our business, for assessing the interest of our customers, just as to study the purchase behaviors and the trends of our customers, and for better defining the development of our services.
