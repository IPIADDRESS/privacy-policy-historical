        <td class="sublist1" scope="col"><strong>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Digital Target we have a few fundamental principles:.</strong><br>
          <br>
We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We  cant stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income  level for no apparent reason.)  We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply  with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.  We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for  the on-going operation of one of our services.  This Privacy Policy is adapted from the Akismet Privacy Policy made  available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license by the fine folks  at Automattic Inc. Thanks guys!<br>
<br>
<strong>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</strong><br>
<br>
Like most website operators, Digital Target collects  non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers  and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,  language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each  visitor request. Digital Target's purpose in collecting non-personally  identifying information is to better understand how Digital Target's  visitors use its website. From time to time, Digital Target may release  non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by  publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.<br>
<br>
Digital Target also collects potentially personally-identifying  information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Digital Target does  not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does  not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances  that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as  described below.<br>
<br>
<strong>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br>
<br>
Certain visitors to Digital Target's websites choose to interact with  Digital Target in ways that require Digital Target to gather  personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information  that Digital Target gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.  Digital Target does not disclose personally-identifying information  other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply  personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent  them from engaging in certain website-related activities.<br>
<br>
<strong>Aggregated Statistics</strong><br>
<br>
Digital Target may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to  its websites. Digital Target may display this information publicly or  provide it to others. However, Digital Target does not disclose  personally-identifying information other than as described below.<br>
<br>
<strong>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br>
<br>
Digital Target discloses potentially personally-identifying and  personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,  contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that  information in order to process it on Digital Target's behalf or to  provide services available at Digital Target's websites, and (ii) that  have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,  contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your  home country; by using DDigital Target's websites, you consent to the  transfer of such information to them. Digital Target will not rent or  sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying  information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and  affiliated organizations, as described above, Digital Target discloses  potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying  information only when required to do so by law, or when Digital Target  believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to  protect the property or rights of Digital Target, third parties or the  public at large. If you are a registered user of a Digital Target  website and have supplied your email address, Digital Target may  occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit  your feedback, or just keep you up to date with whats going on with  Digital Target and our products. We primarily use our various product  blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep  this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example  via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve  the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your  request or to help us support other users. Digital Target takes all  measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized  access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.<br>
<br>
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
<br>
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitors  computer, and that the visitors browser provides to the website each  time the visitor returns. Digital Target uses cookies to help Digital  Target identify and track visitors, their usage of any Digital Target  website, and their website access preferences. Digital Target visitors  who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set  their browsers to refuse cookies before using Digital Target websites,  with the drawback that certain features of Digital Target's websites  may not function properly without the aid of cookies.<br>
<br>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx" title="Double Click">click here</a>.<br>
<br>

<strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong><br>
<br>
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Digital Target may change  its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at Digital Target's sole  discretion. Digital Target encourages visitors to frequently check this  page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this  site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your  acceptance of such change.<br></td>
