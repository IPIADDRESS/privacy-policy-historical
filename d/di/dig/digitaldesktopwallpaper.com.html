		    We may collect, store and use the  following kinds of personal data:
          </p>
		  <p align="left">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information  about your computer and about your visits to and use of this website including your  IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit  and number of page views;<br>
		    <br>
		    (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information relating to any transactions  carried out between you and us on or in relation to this website, including  information relating to any purchases you make of our goods or services;</p>

          <p align="left">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information that you  provide to us for the purpose of registering with us including your name and  email address;</p>

		  <p><strong>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies</strong></p>
		  <p>A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web  browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back  to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.  This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. </p>
		  <p>We may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on this  website.&nbsp; <br>
              
		    Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your  browser.&nbsp; Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until  deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.</p>
		  <p>We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website.&nbsp; Google  Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use  by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers.&nbsp; The  information generated relating to our website is used to create reports  about the use of the website. Google will store this information.&nbsp;  Google's privacy policy is available at: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html">http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html</a>.</p>
		  <p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit this website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.<br><br> If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">here</a>.</p>
		  
		  
		  <strong>Google and the DoubleClick DART cookie</strong><br><br>
<ul>
  <li>Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on this site. </li>
  <li>Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our sites and other sites on the Internet. </li>
  <li>Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>. </li>
</ul>
		  
		  
		  <p>Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies.&nbsp; For example,  in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”,  “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using  the sliding selector.&nbsp; This will, however, have a negative impact upon  the usability of many websites as usernames, passwords and other  preferences would not be retained. If you are using the Firefox  browser, you can refuse cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Options”,  “Privacy” and unticking the “Accept cookies from sites” option. </p>
