		<p><span class="b">Introduction</span></p>

		<p>
            DigiCert, Inc. ("DigiCert") is committed to protecting the privacy of its customers and website visitors. As a result, DigiCert has developed this privacy policy to inform its website visitors and customers about how DigiCert collects, uses, shares and secures your personal information, as well as your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information. This privacy policy applies to&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">www.digicert.com</a>, a site owned and operated by DigiCert.
        </p>

		<p><span class="b">Non-Personal Information</span></p>

		<p>
            DigiCert, like most website operators, uses cookies and web beacons and log files to automatically gather, analyze, and store non-personal information about website visitors. Non-personal information may include the visitor's IP address, browser type, ISP, referring page, operating system, date/time, and clickstream data. DigiCert uses third-party software to assist in collecting and analyzing this information. This information is used to improve DigiCert's service and enhance the experience of DigiCert's website visitors.
        </p>
		
		<p>
            Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts are used by DigiCert and our third party service providers to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements around the site, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. Visit our&nbsp;<a href="/digicert-cookie-policy.htm" target="_blank">Online Cookies</a> and Privacy&nbsp;page for a list of cookies used on the DigiCert website.  You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.  To manage Flash cookies, please click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
            DigiCert uses a third party to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;(or if located in the European Union click&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.
        </p>

		<p><span class="b">Personal Information</span></p>

		<p>
            In order to provide quality communication, DigiCert collects information such as the name, organization, and email address of website visitors who voluntarily submit that information to download software or to submit sales or technical support questions. We also collect information required to issue certificates (as specified in our <a href="/ssl-cps-repository.htm" target="_blank">Certification Practices Statement</a>) when you buy certificates from our site. This information is voluntarily submitted by the customer or is obtained from third-party databases during the validation process.
        </p>

		<p>
            Regardless of the source, DigiCert protects personal information as confidential information except where the information is embedded in an issued digital certificate. This information is necessary for the digital certificate's operation and is considered public information. DigiCert's certificate profiles, available through DigiCert's online repository at&nbsp;<a href="/ssl-cps-repository.htm" target="_blank">https://www.digicert.com/ssl-cps-repository.htm</a>, list the information embedded in each certificate type.
        </p>
        <p>
            When performing validation, DigiCert uses third party sources to confirm or supplement customer information.  We may receive information about you from other sources, including third parties from whom we have purchased access to certain data, and combine this data with information we already have about you.  We may confirm or supplement, for instance, address, email and company name for validation and verification purposes.
        </p>

		<p><span class="b">Accessing and Updating Personal Information</span></p>

		<p>
            Generally, a customer can review, delete inaccuracies, and update personal information through its DigiCert account interface by clicking edit under the Account Profile tab. Alternatively, upon request DigiCert will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information.  You may also access, correct or request deletion of your personal information by sending an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@digicert.com">privacy@digicert.com</a>&nbsp;or by mailing DigiCert at the address listed in this policy. Emailed and mailed requests are subject to DigiCert's satisfaction about the authenticity of the request. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
        </p>
		
		<p>
            DigiCert retains information about customers while the customer’s account is active, while a certificate remains unexpired, and in accordance with industry standards. A customer may request account cancellation or request that DigiCert no longer provide services by emailing&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@digicert.com">privacy@digicert.com</a>. DigiCert may retain certain customer information after receiving a request to cancel services or disable an account, as necessary to comply with industry standards and legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce customer agreements.
        </p>

		<p>
            Personal information embedded in a digital certificate cannot be directly edited. Customers wishing to update personal information in a digital certificate must submit a change request through the customer account. DigiCert may require that the updated information be verified for accuracy prior to accepting the change request. In addition, even if information is updated in DigiCert's databases, the information will generally not be updated in the issued digital certificate. If information embedded in a digital certificate needs updating, DigiCert may require revocation of the digital certificate.
        </p>

		<p><span class="b">Use of Information</span></p>

		<p><span class="b">Products and Services</span></p>

		<p>
            DigiCert may use personal information to market, sell and provide its products and services, send an order confirmation, respond to customer service requests, and fulfill your order, including using the information to verify the identity of the customer or to contact the customer in order to discuss support, renewal, and the purchase of products and services.
        </p>

		<p>
            As discussed further in the "Sharing With Third Parties" section below, DigiCert may allow its business partners to assist in providing requested products and services. All such DigiCert service providers are required to keep personal information confidential and are only allowed to use the information to the extent necessary to provide the requested products and services.
        </p>

		<p><span class="b">Live Chat Sales/Support</span></p>

		<p>
            DigiCert utilizes a live chat tool for assisting our customers with sales questions and technical support needs; in addition to the customer's name and email address (for purposes of communication), this tool collects information in accordance with the "Non-Personal Information" section above.
        </p>

		<p><span class="b">Emails</span></p>

		<p>
            DigiCert may send out promotional emails (such as a newsletter) to individuals who provide personal information and have not opted-out of DigiCert's mailing list. These emails may include beacons that communicate information about the email back to DigiCert. This communication allows DigiCert to gauge the effectiveness of its advertising and marketing campaigns. Recipients may opt-out of receiving promotional communication from DigiCert by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each promotional email or by emailing&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@digicert.com">privacy@digicert.com</a>.
        </p>

		<p>
            DigiCert also sends out advisory emails. Advisory emails are related to the primary purpose for which the information was collected and are used to respond to inquiries, provide support and validation services, provide upgrade information and security updates, and inform the customer about ordered products and services. Because advisory emails contain essential information related to the use and security of DigiCert's products and services, customers may not unsubscribe from advisory emails.
        </p>

		<p>
            DigiCert may use third parties, with which it has a confidentiality agreement, to send promotional or advisory emails. However, DigiCert restricts its partners from sending spam associated with DigiCert's site, brand, or products. A customer receiving an unsolicited email related to DigiCert's products and services should forward the entire message and headers to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@digicert.com">privacy@digicert.com</a>.
        </p>

		<p><span class="b">Sharing With Third Parties</span></p>

		<p>
            We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.
        </p>
		
		<p>
            DigiCert never sells personal information to third parties. We may share your information with third parties who provide services on our behalf to help with our business activities.  These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
        </p>
		
		<p>
            DigiCert uses a third party to process credit card payments and may provide credit card numbers and identifying financial data directly to the third party credit card processor. These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes. DigiCert does not permanently store any provided credit card information.
        </p>
		
		<p>
            DigiCert also uses a third party to provide its chat-based support. The support software allows users to input information, including an email address, to request support and clarify their problem. The software provider does not share inputted information with anyone other than DigiCert.
        </p>
		
		<p>
            DigiCert may disclose information when required by law or when disclosure is necessary to protect DigiCert's rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process.
        </p>

		<p>
            DigiCert will notify all interested parties if DigiCert is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets that materially affects how DigiCert collects and stores personal information. Typically, this notice will be by email and/or a prominent notice on our website.
        </p>
		
		<p><span class="b">Referrals</span></p>
		
		<p>
            If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. DigiCert collects this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking success of the referral program.
        </p>
		
		<p>
            Your friend may contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@digicert.com">privacy@digicert.com</a>&nbsp;to request that we remove this information from our database.
        </p>
		
		<p><span class="b">Testimonials</span></p>

		<p>
            With prior permission from the customer, DigiCert displays personal testimonials of satisfied customers on its website in addition to other endorsements. Customers wishing to update or delete a testimonial may contact DigiCert at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@digicert.com">privacy@digicert.com</a>.
        </p>
		
		<p><span class="b">Blogs</span></p>

		<p>
            The DigiCert website includes social media features, such as a Facebook "Like" button and widgets, as well as share buttons or interactive mini-programs. These features may collect the user's IP address, may collect the pages visited on DigiCert's site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on DigiCert's site. Interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the corresponding social media company.
        </p>
		
		<p><span class="b">Security</span></p>
		
		<p>
            The security of your personal information is of the utmost importance to DigiCert.
