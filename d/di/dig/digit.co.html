      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><small>Last updated: August 17, 2015</small></p>
      <p>This privacy policy (this "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policy</span>") explains how personal
      information is collected, used, stored, and disclosed by Hello Digit, Inc.
      ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Digit</span>," "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">we</span>," "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">us</span>," and "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">our</span>"). This Privacy Policy applies to
      consumer users (individually referred to as "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span>") of our websites, applications, and
      other online services to which this Privacy Policy is posted (collectively,
      our "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Services</span>").</p>

      <p>This Privacy Policy is part of our <a href="/about/legal/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>. By accessing or using our Services,
      you agree to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. The provisions
      contained in this Privacy Policy supersede all previous notices and
      statements regarding our privacy practices with respect to our Services. If
      you do not agree to every provision of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of
      Use, you may not access or use our Services.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Application of this Privacy Policy</h2>

      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to your use of (regardless of means of access)
      our Services. You may access or use our Services through a desktop, laptop,
      mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device (each, a
      "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Device</span>").</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3>Information You Provide Us</h3>
      <p>In general, you can visit <a href="https://digit.co">digit.co</a> without telling us who you are
      or revealing any information about yourself. When you submit an inquiry via
      our Services or register for a Digit account, we may collect personal
      information from you, which may include your name, email address, mobile
      phone number, banking information, and other information that identifies you
      (collectively, "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personal
      Information</span>"). By providing your Personal Information to us, you
      expressly agree to our collection, use, storage, and disclosure of such
      information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <p>We may also ask you to create login information for your Digit account,
      such as a username and password. When you provide your mobile phone number,
      we may ask for your consent to receive text messages relating to our Services
      at that number. You may withdraw your consent by contacting us as indicated
      below or by replying with "STOP" to any text message we send you. Please note
      that if you withdraw your consent to receive text messages from us, you may
      not be able to use some of our Services. Your mobile carrier's standard text
      message and data charges may apply to text messages you receive from us, and
      you are responsible for any fees charged by your mobile carrier if we contact
      you.</p>
      <h3>Information About Your Transactions</h3>
      <p>We collect Personal Information about your transactions with us and
      others.</p>
      <h3>Information From Third Parties</h3>
      <p>We also collect Personal Information about you from other companies. For
      instance, we may receive Personal Information about you from a consumer
      reporting agency.</p>

      <h3>Information Automatically Collected</h3>
      <p>We (or our service providers acting on our behalf) may collect information
      about your use of our Services. This information may include Personal
      Information as well as statistical information that does not identify you
      ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Analytics</span>"). Some
      Analytics may be correlated with Personal Information. When Analytics are,
      directly or indirectly, associated or combined with Personal Information,
      such Analytics will be considered Personal Information for purposes of this
      Privacy Policy.</p>

      <p>Information that we automatically collect in connection with your access
      or use of our Services may include:</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Device Information</span>: We
      may collect Device-specific information (such as hardware model, operating
      system version, unique Device identifiers, and mobile network Information,
      including your mobile phone number). We may associate your Device identifiers
      or mobile phone number with your Digit account.</p>

      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Log Information</span>: We may
      record or log information from your Devices, their software, and your
      activity accessing or using our Services. This information may include:</p>

      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>The Device's Internet Protocol ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">IP</span>") address</li>

        <li>Identification numbers associated with your Devices</li>

        <li>Device event information, such as crashes, system activity, and hardware
        settings</li>

        <li>Location preferences</li>

        <li>Date and time stamps of transactions</li>

        <li>System configuration information</li>

        <li>Other interactions with our Services</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Information Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
      <p>We use cookies to personalize our Services for you and to collect
      aggregate information about usage of our Services. A cookie is a text file or
      other local storage identifier provided by your browser or associated
      applications. We use cookies for record-keeping purposes and to enhance the
      quality of your use of our Services. The cookies assign random, unique
      numbers to your Devices to enable our systems to recognize your Devices and
      to allow us to see how you use our Services. Additional general information
      about cookies and how they work is available at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

      <p>The cookies we use in connection with our Services include:</p>

      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Session cookies</span>: Session
      cookies are temporary cookies that expire and are automatically erased
      whenever you close your browser window. We use session cookies to grant users
      access to content and to enable actions they must be logged into their Digit
      account to perform.</p>

      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Persistent cookies</span>:
      Persistent cookies usually have an expiration date in the distant future and
      remain in your browser until they expire or you manually delete them. We use
      persistent cookies to better understand usage patterns so we can improve our
      Services. For example, we may use a persistent cookie to associate you with
      your Digit account or to remember your choices for our Services.</p>

      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third-</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">party cookies</span>: We permit certain third
      parties to place cookies through our Services to provide us with better
      insights into the use of our Services and user demographics and to advertise
      our Services to you. These third parties may collect information about your
      online activities over time and across different websites when you access or
      use our Services. For example, we utilize Google Analytics to analyze usage
      patterns for our Services. Google Analytics generates a cookie to capture
      information about your use of our Services, which Google uses to compile
      reports on website activity for us and to provide other related services.
      Google may use a portion of your IP address to identify its cookie, but this
      will not be associated with any other data held by Google. We may also permit
      third-party service providers to place cookies for our Services, as indicated
      above, to perform analytic or marketing functions where you are notified of
      them and you have consented to the usage. We do not control the use of such
      third-party cookies or the resulting information, and we are not responsible
      for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>

      <p>By accessing or using our Services, you consent to the placement of
      cookies on your Devices as described in this Privacy Policy. If you prefer
      not to receive cookies through our Services, you may control how your browser
      responds to cookies by adjusting the privacy and security settings of your
      web browser. Unless you set your browser settings to refuse all cookies, our
      system may issue cookies when you access or use our Services. If you set your
      browser settings to refuse all cookies, the performance of certain features
      of our Services may be limited or not work at all.</p>

      <h3>Do-Not-Track Signals</h3>
      <p>Do Not Track ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">DNT</span>") is
      an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences
      regarding tracking by advertisers and other third parties. We do not use
      technology that recognizes DNT signals from your web browser.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>

      <p>We may use Analytics as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy and for
      research and commercial purposes, such as to improve our Services.</p>

      <p>We may use Personal Information for the purposes described elsewhere in
      this Privacy Policy and internally for our general commercial purposes,
      including, among other things, to offer our products and services and
      products and services of third parties that we think you might find of
      interest, but only Digit and our third-party service providers involved in
      distributing the offers or providing the products or services will have
      access to your Personal Information. Our third-party service providers will
      only be permitted to use Personal Information for that intended purpose.</p>

      <p>We may use your email address to respond to your inquiries and to provide
      you information about our Services. You may elect not to receive promotional
      emails from us either by "unsubscribing" to an email you receive from us or
      by contacting us as indicated below. If you unsubscribe from receiving emails
      from us, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about
      your Digit account or our ongoing business relations, unless you withdraw
      your consent to receive electronic communications as provided in our Terms of
      Use.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
      <p>We <span style="text-decoration: underline;">do not share</span> your
      Personal Information with: (1) other financial companies for joint marketing
      purposes; (2) affiliated companies for their everyday business purposes; or
      (3) any third parties so they can market to you.</p>

      <p>We may share your Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties:
      (1) if you request or authorize it; (2) if the information is provided to
      help complete a transaction for you; (3) if the information is provided to:
      (a) comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, governmental and
      quasi-governmental requests, court orders, or subpoenas; (b) enforce our
      Terms of Use or other agreements; or (c) protect our rights, property, or
      safety or the rights, property, or safety of our users or others (e.g., to a
      consumer reporting agency for fraud protection, etc.); (4) if the disclosure
      is done as part of a purchase, transfer, or sale of services or assets (e.g.,
      in the event that substantially all of our assets are acquired by another
      party, your Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets); (5)
      if the information is provided to our third-party service providers to
      perform functions on our behalf (e.g., analyzing data, providing marketing
      assistance, providing customer service, processing orders, etc.); (6) for our
      everyday business purposes; or (7) as permitted by applicable law or
      otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. When you are no longer our
      customer, we continue to share your information as described in this Privacy
      Policy.</p>

      <p>We may disclose Analytics with third parties as described elsewhere in
      this Privacy Policy and for our commercial purposes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
      <p>If you do not wish to receive offers or other notices from us in the
      future, you can "opt out" by contacting us as indicated at the end of this
      Privacy Policy or by following the "unsubscribe" instructions in any
      communication you receive from us. Please be aware that you are not able to
      opt out of receiving communications about your Digit account or related
      transactions with us.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Accessing Your Information</h2>
      <p>You must notify us of any change in your Personal Information by updating
      your Digit account profile through our Services. Any changes will affect only
      future uses of your Personal Information.</p>

      <p>Subject to applicable law, which might, from time to time, oblige us to
      store your Personal Information for a certain period of time, we will respect
      your wishes to correct inaccurate information. Otherwise, we will hold your
      Personal Information for as long as we believe it will help us achieve our
      objectives as detailed in this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <p>You can ask us whether we are storing your Personal Information and you
      can ask to receive a copy of that Personal Information. Before sending you
      any Personal Information, we will ask you to provide proof of your identity.
      If you are not able to provide proof of your identity, we reserve the right
      to refuse to send you any Personal Information. We will respond as quickly as
      we can to your requests for details of Personal Information we hold about
      you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information You Share Socially</h2>
      <p>Our Services may allow you to connect and share your actions, comments,
      content, and information publicly or with friends. We are not responsible for
      maintaining the confidentiality of any information you share publicly or with
      friends.</p>

      <p>Our Services may also allow you to connect with us on, share on, and use
      third-party websites, applications, and services. Please be mindful of your
      personal privacy needs and the privacy needs of others, as you choose whom to
      connect with and what to share and make public. We cannot control the privacy
      or security of information you choose to make public or share with others. We
      also do not control the privacy practices of third parties. Please contact
      those sites and services directly if you want to learn about their privacy
      practices.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We have, and require our third-party service providers that receive
      Personal Information from us to have, a comprehensive written information
      security program that contains administrative, technical, and physical
      safeguards for our respective physical facilities and in our respective
      computer systems, databases, and communications networks that are reasonably
      designed to protect information contained within such systems from loss,
      misuse, or alteration. When your bank account information is transmitted via
      our Services, it will be protected by encryption technology, such as Secure
      Sockets Layer (SSL).</p>

      <p>No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore,
      we cannot guarantee absolute security of your Personal Information. You also
      play a role in protecting your Personal Information. Please safeguard your
      username and password for your Digit account and do not share them with
      others. If we receive instructions using your Digit account login
      information, we will consider that you have authorized the instructions. You
      agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Digit account
      or any other breach of security. We reserve the right, in our sole
      discretion, to refuse to provide our Services, terminate Digit accounts, and
      to remove or edit content.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Protecting Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Our Services are not directed, or intended to be attractive, to children
      under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from
      children under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, do not use our
      Services or submit any information to us.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Links to Third-Party Websites</h2>
      <p>When you use our Services, you may be directed to other websites that are
      beyond our control. We may also allow third-party websites or applications to
      link to our Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any
      third parties or the content of linked websites, but we do encourage you to
      read the applicable privacy policies and terms and conditions of such parties
      and websites. This Privacy Policy only applies to our Services.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>Subject to applicable law, we may revise this Privacy Policy at any time
      and in our sole discretion. When we revise this Privacy Policy, we will post

      this Privacy Policy. The revised Privacy Policy will be effective upon
      posting via our Services, unless otherwise set forth therein or as otherwise
      required by applicable law. You are free to decide whether or not to accept a
      revised version of this Privacy Policy, but accepting this Privacy Policy, as
      revised, is required for you to continue accessing or using our Services. If
      you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy or any revised version
      of this Privacy Policy, your sole recourse is to terminate your access and
      use of our Services. Except as otherwise expressly stated by us, your access
      and use of our Services is subject to the version of this Privacy Policy in
      effect at the time of access or use.</p>
