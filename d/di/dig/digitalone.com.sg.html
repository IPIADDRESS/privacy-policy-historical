        <p>SPH uses "cookies", where a small data file is sent to your browser

          The cookie is used to track information such as the number of users 



          and their frequency of use, profiles of users and their preferred sites.

		<p>Like many web site operators, SPH  uses the independent company Nielsen//NetRatings to measure and analyse the internet usage across SPH web sites. Nielsen//NetRatings is a leader in the internet industry in interactive measurement technologies and market research. SPH uses Nielsen//NetRatings' services to collect the following core information on the usage of our web sites, including: 

		</p><ul>



		<li>The number of page views (or page impressions) that occur on SPH web sites; 



		</li><li>The number of unique visitors to SPH web sites; 



		</li><li>How long these unique visitors (on average) spend on SPH web sites when they do visit; and 



		</li><li>Common entry and exit points into SPH web sites. 



		</li></ul>



		<p>This aggregate, non-personal information is collated by Nielsen//NetRatings and provided to SPH to assist in analysing the usage of SPH web sites. The Nielsen//NetRatings data is also accessible by media organizations and research companies, for the purpose of conducting industry comparisons with other Internet portals.



		</p><p>All pages on SPH web sites are coded with software provided by Nielsen//NetRatings. This is transparent to the user as the software makes use of an invisible image (via _Javascript) or an invisible Java Applet*, at the bottom of the web page. This software stores a "cookie" in the browser, which contains a unique identifier. This enables Nielsen//NetRatings to track the number of unique visitors to our web sites. This information is collected and aggregated by Nielsen//NetRatings, and in no way does this unique identifier identify a user personally. SPH do not and will not marry any data collected by Nielsen//NetRatings with any personal information collected on SPH web sites.



		</p><p>Nielsen//NetRatings software code cannot be disabled entirely on SPH web sites, as Nielsen//NetRatings' measure code takes into account all web-browser configurations, including the disabling of Java and Javascript. Nielsen//NetRatings' methods of measuring unique visitors takes into account the proportion of visitors who have disabled cookies in their browser.
