Champ Entertainment, Inc. ("CHAMP") is committed to respecting your 
      privacy.&nbsp; Please read the following policy to understand how your personal 
      information will be treated.&nbsp; This policy may change from time to time so 
      please check back periodically.&nbsp; This policy will let you know the following:<p></p>
    <p>1. What personally identifiable information is collected from me?</p>
    <p>2. What are cookies and how they are used by CHAMP?</p>
    <p>3. How is my information used?</p>
    <p>4. Who is collecting my information?</p>
    <p>5. With whom will my information be shared?</p>
    <p>6. How can I access, update or delete my information?</p>
    <p>7. What does “opt-out” mean?</p>
    <p>8. What else should I know about my privacy?</p>
    <p>9. Other legal notices.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>1. What personally identifiable information is collected from me?</b></p>
    <p>On some CHAMP Web pages you can make requests and/or receive materials.&nbsp; 
      The types of personal information collected at these pages are your name, 
      e-mail address and standard contact information, including addresses and 
      phone numbers.</p>
    <p>We may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding 
      your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with the 
      services we provide and contact preferences. Wherever CHAMP collects personal 
      information, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy 
      on that page.</p>
    <p><b>2. What are cookies and how are they used by CHAMP?</b></p>
    <p>CHAMP may place Internet cookies on your hard drive.&nbsp; Internet cookies 
      are small files that may be placed on your hard disk for record-keeping 
      purposes.&nbsp; Cookies are used to (a)&nbsp;remind us of who you are in order to 
      deliver you better service; (b)&nbsp;estimate our audience size by determining 
      repeat usage of the Web site to help target advertisements based on user 
      interests and behavior; (c)&nbsp;track your progress and entries in promotions, 
      sweepstakes and contests, if any; and (d)&nbsp;measure certain traffic patterns 
      for use as a research tool to understand how our users’ habits are similar 
      or different from one another.&nbsp; You can set your browser to notify you when 
      you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to 
      accept it. By not accepting cookies, some Web pages may not display properly 
      or you may not be permitted to access certain information.</p>
    <p>CHAMP may also collect IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) 
      to track a user’s session while the user remains anonymous.&nbsp; We analyze 
      this data for certain trends in statistics, such as which parts of our site 
      users are visiting and how long they spend there.&nbsp; In general, we do not 
      link your IP addresses to anything personally identifiable to you.</p>
    <p><b>3. How is my information used?</b></p>
    <p>CHAMP will not provide your personally identifiable information to others 
      without your consent.&nbsp; The information you provide will be used to support 
      your customer relationship with CHAMP. Your information may be shared with 
      agents, contractors or business partners for the purpose of performing services 
      for CHAMP.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We want to help you quickly find information on CHAMP and alert you to 
      specific offers, updated information, and other new products and services 
      from CHAMP. Accordingly, we may send you email, direct mailings or contact 
      you by telephone about our various products and services or other products 
      and services we feel may be of interest to you.&nbsp; If you do not want to receive 
      such mailings, simply “opt-out” by the means provided for in the mailings 
      or by contacting support@digibizpro.com</p>
    <p><u></u></p>
    <p>Notwithstanding, CHAMP does research on our users’ demographics, interests 
      and behavior based on the information provided to us during your use of 
      the CHAMP Web site.&nbsp; This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated 
      basis.&nbsp; Aggregated data does not include personally identifiable information.&nbsp; 
      CHAMP may share this aggregated data with others.</p>
    <p>From time to time affiliates of CHAMP may have special offers for customers 
      of CHAMP. In such cases you will be given an opportunity to “opt-in” and 
      receive additional information about those offers. In such cases by electing 
      to receive information from CHAMP affiliates your information will be transferred 
      to those third parties. The information practices of those third parties 
      are not covered by this privacy statement.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>4. Who is collecting my information?</b></p>
    <p>When you are on an CHAMP site and are asked for personal information, you 
      are sharing that information with CHAMP alone, unless specifically stated 
      otherwise.&nbsp; If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company 
      other than CHAMP or an agent for CHAMP, you will be notified prior to the 
      time of the data collection or transfer.&nbsp; If you do not want your data to 
      be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular 
      service or purchasing those particular goods.</p>
    <p>Please be aware that CHAMP advertisers or Web sites that have links on 
      our site may collect personally identifiable information about you.&nbsp; The 
      information practices of those Web sites linked to CHAMP either through 
      advertisements or other hyperlinks are not covered by this privacy statement 
      and CHAMP shall have no liability for the actions and policies of these 
      third parties.</p>
    <p><b>5. With whom does CHAMP share my information?</b></p>
    <p>We may share the personal data you provide with other CHAMP agents, contractors 
      or our business partners for the purposes of performing services for CHAMP.&nbsp; 
      CHAMP also may share aggregated data with others.&nbsp; Aggregated data does 
      not include personally identifiable information.&nbsp; We also believe it is 
      necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take 
      action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving 
      potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the 
      Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.&nbsp; Except as provided above 
      or in the event of a merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially 
      all of CHAMP’s assets, we will not share any of your information with any 
      third party without your permission.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>6. How do I access, update or delete my information?</b></p>
    <p>You can request the individual information that CHAMP has collected about 
      you, correct factual inaccuracies in your information, remove personal information 
      from CHAMP’s databases and/or update your personal information by contacting 
      <u>support@digibizpro.com</u>.</p>
    <p><b></b></p>
    <p><b>7. What does “opt-out” mean?</b></p>
    <p><b></b></p>
    <p>To “opt-out” means that you have notified CHAMP that we no longer have 
      permission to use your information to contact you regarding promotions of 
      other CHAMP products. For example, when we send you information on a new 
      product, you will be given the opportunity to “opt-out” of receiving such 
      information in the future.</p>
    <p><b>8. What else should I know about my privacy?</b></p>
    <p>Third party Internet sites and services accessible through CHAMP have separate 
      privacy and data collection practices, independent of us. CHAMP has no responsibility 
      or liability for these independent policies or actions.&nbsp; Please be careful 
      and responsible online.&nbsp; If you post personal information online that is 
      accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other 
      parties in return. While we strive to protect your information, CHAMP cannot 
      ensure or warrant the security of any information through the transmission 
      process and you do so at your own risk.</p>
    <p><b>9.&nbsp;Other Legal Notices.</b></p>
    <p><b></b>Any dispute over privacy is subject to this privacy policy, our 
      <u><a href="iterms.php">Terms of Service</a></u> , and any other agreements 
      you have entered into with CHAMP concerning the services offered through 
      digibizpro.com including limitations on damages and application of the law 
      of the State of New York. If you have any concern about your privacy in 
      connection with this policy, please send us a thorough description to <u>support@digibizpro.com</u> 
      and we will try to resolve it.&nbsp; We may post a revised privacy policy on 
      our site.&nbsp; Please note that the use of information that we gather is subject 
      to the privacy notice in effect at the time of use.&nbsp; You should check our 
      Web site frequently to see recent changes.</p>
