						<p><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>
						<p>Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operation of
						DigitalImageCafe.Com, we gather certain types of information about
						our users, and we would like to explain the types of
						information we gather, what we do with it and how to correct or change the
						information.</p>
						<p>DigitalImageCafe.Com collects two types of
						data from users: volunteered personal data (such as names, addresses,
						e-mail addresses, etc.); and aggregated data (such as information about traffic
						patterns on DigitalImageCafe.Com).</p>
						<p><b>Personal Data</b></p>
						<p>Personal data is collected when users provide personal
						data to DigitalImageCafe.Com, for example in registering
						for membership services, in answering surveys, providing course review information,
						requesting information, and purchasing items from DigitalImageCafe.Com and/or any of its partners. Also, we collect the e-mail addresses of users who post
						messages to our message boards (forum).</p>
						<p><b>Aggregated Information</b></p>
						<p>Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or
						visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or
						site registrations, is collected through various methods. For example,
						DigitalImageCafe.Com collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that
						is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web
						servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your
						computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from DigitalImageCafe.Com,
						 our servers log your IP address. DigitalImageCafe.Com does not link IP addresses to anything personally
						identifiable, so although your session will be logged, you will remain
						anonymous to us. DigitalImageCafe.Com collects IP addresses for the
						purposes of system administration and to provide aggregate data to advertisers
						about the volume of use on DigitalImageCafe.Com.</p>
						<p><b>Use of Cookies</b></p>
						<p>DigitalImageCafe.Com also uses "cookies" to collect
						information. A cookie is a small data file that most major Web sites write to
						your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow
						DigitalImageCafe.Com to measure activity on the Site and to improve your
						user experience, for example, by remembering your passwords and viewing
						preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only parts of the Site
						without reregistering. Cookies are used by DigitalImageCafe.Com to
						measure activity on the Site and make improvements and updates based on which
						areas are popular and which are not. DigitalImageCafe.Com does not
						use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally
						sent in a cookie. Except for personal information voluntarily provided by you
						(i.e., during membership registration or a request for information),
						DigitalImageCafe.Com does not use information transferred through cookies
						for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with
						any third parties whatsoever. You may occasionally get cookies from our
						advertisers, which is standard in the Internet industry. DigitalImageCafe.Com does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not
						subject to DigitalImageCafe.Com's privacy policies.</p>
						<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set
						yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However,
						it is possible that some parts of the Site will not function properly if you do
						so.</p>
						<p><b>Use of Information Collected by DigitalImageCafe.Com</b></p>
						<p>DigitalImageCafe.Com uses both the personal and aggregated information we
						collect for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content
						of the Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Site for each
						individual user and to notify users about updates to the Site or promotional
						offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you.
						DigitalImageCafe.Com will share aggregated information with third parties for
						both advertising and promotional purposes.</p>
						<p>DigitalImageCafe.Com does not share your personal information with third parties
						without your permission.</p>
						<p><b>How to Unsubscribe from Newsletters</b></p>
						<p>If you'd rather not receive news and updates via e-mail, simply: Send a blank
						email with the subject line "Remove" to <a href="mailto:webmaster@DigitalImageCafe.Com">webmaster@DigitalImageCafe.Com</a>
						, or send a letter to Customer
						Service, Varicom Computer Consulting, 4038 Stonehurst, Pearland, TX
						77584.</p>
						<p><b>Children	and Privacy</b></p>
						<p>DigitalImageCafe.Com encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online, and
						to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children. No information
						should be submitted to or posted on the Site by users under the age of 13
						without the consent of their parent or guardian. Personal information from
						anyone registering on the site and reporting they are under the age of 13 is
						not kept in our database.</p>
						<p><b>Links to Other Sites</b></p>
						<p>It is important to
						note that DigitalImageCafe.Com contains links to sites other
						than DigitalImageCafe.Com, and that those sites may not
						follow the same privacy policies as DigitalImageCafe.Com. For
						instance, if you click on an advertisement on DigitalImageCafe.Com, this
						will take you away from DigitalImageCafe.Com and to an entirely different
						site. This can include links from advertisers, content providers and partners
						who may use DigitalImageCafe.Com's logo and/or style as a
						result of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to
						you, and may collect data and make uses of it that DigitalImageCafe.Com would not.</p>
						<p>DigitalImageCafe.Com reserves
						the right to change this policy at any time by notifying users of the existence
						of a revised privacy policy. You can e-mail us with any further questions at
						<a href="mailto:digitalimagecafe@buildyourweb.com">digitalimagecafe@buildyourweb.com</a>.
