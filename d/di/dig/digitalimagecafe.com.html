            <p>Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operation of
              DigitalImageCafe.Com, we gather certain types of information about
              our users, and we would like to explain the types of
              information we gather, what we do with it and how to correct or change the
              information.</p>
            <p>DigitalImageCafe.Com collects two types of
              data from users: volunteered personal data (such as names,
              e-mail addresses, etc.); and aggregated data (such as information about traffic
              patterns on DigitalImageCafe.Com).</p>
            <h3>PERSONAL DATA</h3>
            <p>Personal data is collected when users provide personal
              data to DigitalImageCafe.Com, for example in registering
              for membership services, in answering surveys, 
              requesting information, and purchasing items from DigitalImageCafe.Com. </p>
            <p>In accepting any prize from Digital Image Cafe your contact information will be conveyed to the awarding Sponsor and you give them the right to contact you.</p>
            <h3>AGGREGATED INFORMATION</h3>
            <p>Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or
              visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or
              site registrations, is collected through various methods. For example,
              DigitalImageCafe.Com collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that
              is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web
              servers, the computers that “serve up” Web pages, automatically identify your
              computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from DigitalImageCafe.Com,
              our servers log your IP address. DigitalImageCafe.Com collects IP addresses for the
              purposes of system administration and security logging.</p>
            <h3>USE OF COOKIES</h3>
            <p>DigitalImageCafe.Com also uses “cookies” to collect
              information. A cookie is a small data file that most major Web sites write to
              your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow
              DigitalImageCafe.Com to measure activity on the Site and to improve your
              user experience, for example, by remembering your passwords and viewing
              preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only parts of the Site
              without reregistering. Cookies are used by DigitalImageCafe.Com to
              measure activity on the Site and make improvements and updates based on which
              areas are popular and which are not. DigitalImageCafe.Com does not
              use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally
              sent in a cookie. DigitalImageCafe.Com does not use information transferred through cookies
              for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with
              any third parties whatsoever. You may occasionally get cookies from our
              advertisers, which is standard in the Internet industry. DigitalImageCafe.Com does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not
              subject to DigitalImageCafe.com's privacy policies.
              In addition, Digital Image Cafe displays Google Ads. Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on this site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to users based on their visit to this site and other sites on the Internet.  Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>.
              Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set
              yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However,
              it is possible that some parts of the Site will not function properly if you do
              so.</p>
            <h3>USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED BY DIGITALIMAGECAFE.COM</h3>
            <p>DigitalImageCafe.com uses both the personal and aggregated information we
              collect for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content
              of the Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Site for each
              individual user and to notify users about updates to the Site or promotional
              offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you.
              DigitalImageCafe.com will share aggregated information with third parties for
              both advertising and promotional purposes.</p>
            <p>DigitalImageCafe.com does not share your personal information with third parties
              without your permission.</p>

            <h3>CHILDREN AND PRIVACY</h3>
            <p>DigitalImageCafe.Com encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online, and
              to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children. No information

              without the consent of their parent or guardian. </p>
            <h3>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h3>
            <p>It is important to
              note that DigitalImageCafe.Com contains links to sites other
              than DigitalImageCafe.Com, and that those sites may not
              follow the same privacy policies as DigitalImageCafe.Com. For
              instance, if you click on an advertisement on DigitalImageCafe.Com, this
              will take you away from DigitalImageCafe.Com and to an entirely different
              site. This can include links from advertisers, content providers and partners
              who may use DigitalImageCafe.Com's logo and/or style as a
              result of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to
              you, and may collect data and make uses of it that DigitalImageCafe.Com would not.</p>
            <p>DigitalImageCafe.Com reserves
              the right to change this policy at any time by notifying users of the existence
              of a revised privacy policy. You can e-mail us with any further questions at <a href="mailto:admin@digitalimagecafe.com">admin@digitalimagecafe.com</a>. </p></td>
