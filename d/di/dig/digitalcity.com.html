<b>Privacy Policy</b>
<p>
Digital City, Inc., a business unit of  AOL Studios, is strongly committed to protecting 
the privacy of consumers of its interactive products and services. Throughout cyberspace, 
we want to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for consumers, and in 
particular, ensure that kids' information is protected. The AOL Internet online service 
has a separate privacy policy for its members. If you are an AOL member, you can find 
that policy within our Terms of Service. The purpose of this Digital City privacy policy 
is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to Digital City, what kinds of information we may 
gather about you when you visit Digital City, how we may use that information, whether we 
disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to 
correct, the information. Finally, please note that this policy applies only to Digital 
City and Web sites that carry the Digital City brand, and not to other companies' or 
organizations' Web sites to which we link. We have clearly marked Digital City and these 
branded Web sites with our logo so you know where this policy applies. 
</p><p>
Information About All Digital City Visitors 
<br>
In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and 
frequency of visitors to Digital City and its areas, very much like television ratings that 
tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the 
aggregate. This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the 
site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as 
many of you as possible. For example, Digital City uses a technology nicknamed "cookies" 
that tells us how and when pages in our site are visited, and by how many people. Digital 
City cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine 
information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information to tell 
us who you are or even what your screen name or e-mail address is. We also may provide 
statistical "ratings" information, never information about you personally, to our Digital 
City partners about how our members, collectively, use Digital City. We do this so they too 
can understand how much people use their areas and our site in order for them to provide 
you with the best possible Web experience as well. 
</p><p>
Information About You 
<br>
Sometimes, we may specifically ask for information about you when you sign up to use 
a service or when you order a product. We will need certain information -- such as name, 
Internet address or screen name, billing address, type of computer, credit card number -- 
in order to provide that service or product to you. We may also use that information to 
let you know of additional products and services about which you might be interested. You 
can choose not to receive such information if you don't want to by letting us know on the 
registration screen when you sign up for the product or service. We may ask you for 
information about your interests so that both you and we can take advantage of the 
interactivity of the online medium, but you may always choose to respond or not. 
</p><p>
Disclosure 
<br>
We do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to Digital City 
or information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address or 
telephone number, to any outside companies. But as we mention above, we may share 
with our Web site partners aggregated statistical "ratings" information about the 
use of Digital City. 
</p><p>
Special Attention to Kids 
<br>
America Online, Inc. takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of young 
people using our services. We do not specifically collect information about children 
and believe that children should get their parents' consent before giving out any 
personal information. We encourage you to participate in your child's experience in 
cyberspace and to review our important safety tips before your child explores the 
Internet. AOL also recommends that parents who are AOL members use AOL's Parental 
Controls or, if not, other Web filtering technology to supervise their kids' access 
to the Web. 
</p><p>
Digital City Privacy Policy Changes 
<br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy for Digital City, we will post those 
changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might 
use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
