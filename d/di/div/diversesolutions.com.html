		<b>Effective June 12, 2008</b></p>
	<p>
		<b>Our Commitment To Privacy</b></p>
	<p>
		Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this
		notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make
		about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to
		find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable
		information may be requested.</p>
	<p>
		<b>The Information We Collect</b></p>
	<p>
		This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Diverse Solutions
		website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive
		materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Name </li>
		<li>Address </li>
		<li>Email address </li>
		<li>Phone number </li>
		<li>Credit/Debit Card Information </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you
		find a real estate property online and want it share it with a recipient via email,
		you will need to submit the recipient's name and email address address. In this
		circumstance, the types of personal information collected are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Name </li>
		<li>Email Address </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<b>The Way We Use Information</b></p>
	<p>
		We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to
		complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except
		to the extent necessary to complete that order.</p>
	<p>
		We use the information you provide about someone else when sharing information about
		a real estate property only to email them the desired information. We do not share
		this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to send the
		email.</p>
	<p>
		We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are
		not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.</p>
	<p>
		We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website. However,
		we never disclose anything to outside parties that could be used to identify individuals.</p>
	<p>
		Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided
		to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing
		you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b></p>
	<p>
		To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use
		of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
		procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy</b></p>
	<p>
		Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason,
		we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know
		are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>
	<p>
		<b>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</b></p>
	<p>
		You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online
		and maintain by emailing us at info@diversesolutions.com. We use this procedure
		to better safeguard your information.</p>
	<p>
		You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending
		us a request that credibly shows error.</p>
	<p>
		To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify
		your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>
	<p>
		<b>How To Contact Us</b></p>
	<p>
		Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please
		call us at 877.348.7654 or send us an email at info@diversesolutions.com.</p>
