20153<br><br>Secure Transactions<br><br>Statistically, it's safer to shop online with your credit card than to use it in a restaurant or department store. At Scripophily.com, protecting your personal information is extremely important to us. To ensure that you never have to worry about credit card safety when you shop in our store, we use security software called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. When you connect with our secure server, they exchange a handshake, which initiates a secure session. In most browsers, look for a key or lock icon to indicate that you are in the SSL mode. From that point on during your secure session, all the information sent between you and Scripophily.com is protected by SSL encryption.<br><br>Once we receive your credit card information, it is immediately encrypted and stored.. This step prevents anyone except the credit card authorization company from viewing it. To ensure your proper processing of your order, we will manually review each order prior to charging your credit card.  We do this to so you know you are dealing with a person not a computer!<br><br>We will send you an immediate email verifying receipt of your order with your order confirmation number. Please keep this number handy if you need to contact us with any questions about your order.<br><br></font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
