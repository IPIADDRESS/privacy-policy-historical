</p><p><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size="-1">At Diversified, protecting your privacy is very important to us.  By posting our Internet Privacy Policy, we want you to understand what information we collect about you when you visit our Website and how we use that information.  This Internet Privacy Policy also describes our practices for handling and securing such information.  This Policy applies solely to information collected by this Website (divinvest.com).  The Policy does not apply to third party websites, if any, linking to or from this site.  Diversified is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size="-1"><b>Categories of Information We Collect&nbsp;</b></font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size="-1"><u>Nonpublic Personal Information&nbsp;</u></font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size="-1">Diversified will collect no personal information about you (such as your name or address) when you visit this Website unless you choose to provide that information to us.  You may choose to provide us with personal information in order to use a password-protected portion of our Website (such as the Diversified Direct Online (DDOL) account access service and the RetireTek<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> planning service), or to contact us by using e-mail.  We use the information to service your account or, in the case of e-mail, to help us get you the information you have requested and to respond to your message.  The password-protected portions of our Website are secure and you should consult the Security Information page on this Website for additional information about our Internet security procedures.  E-mail on the Internet is not secure, however, unless you are using a secure e-mail program.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size="-1"><u>Other Information&nbsp;</u></font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size="-1">If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the Website, read pages, or download information, we will not gather and store any information about your visit.  &nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size="-1">If you use our retirement or financial planning calculators, the information that you input into the calculator is used only for purposes of generating the illustration requested and is not stored by Diversified.  Such calculators do not require you to input any information that identifies you personally.  Diversified may conduct online surveys regarding its Website or other products or services.  You may choose to complete such surveys by inputting the requested information.  The information you provide is used collectively for analytical purposes, and individual responses are not tracked.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size="-1"><u>Cookies&nbsp;</u></font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size="-1">"Cookies" are small text files that some websites transfer to your computer for added functionality, or for tracking website usage.  A website may place personal information into the cookie file to help you navigate through the website.  For example, a website may use the cookie file to store a password so that you do not have to continually input it every time you move to a different section of a password-protected portion of the website.  Also, a website may place other information into the cookie file in order to measure the effectiveness of the site.  For example, a website may use the cookie file to store the Internet domain or IP address from which you access the website, the type of browser and operating system used to access the site, the date and time you access the site, the pages you visit and the address of websites from which you access the site.  Such information are compiled on an aggregate, anonymous basis.  Most cookies are designed to expire after a certain period of time but you can delete your cookie file or set the browser to notify you when a website is sending a cookie to your computer so that you may accept or reject it.&nbsp;</font></font>  
</p><p><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size="-1">Diversified does not use cookies to gather and store information on its public Website.  Consequently, Diversified does not track or record information about individuals' visits to the public Website.  However, Diversified recognizes the benefits that such information can provide to help make our site more useful to visitors and to help us determine the effectiveness of the site.  Accordingly, Diversified may develop a keen interest in making use of cookie technology in the future.  With respect to the password-protected portion of the Website, the DDOL web application uses a cookie to hold the session ID of the user for the limited purpose of accessing Diversified's servers.  This encrypted file is removed from the browser when the session is terminated.

</p><p><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size="-1"><b>Our Information Security Procedures&nbsp;</b></font></font>

We restrict access to your personal information to those employees and service providers who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.  We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.
