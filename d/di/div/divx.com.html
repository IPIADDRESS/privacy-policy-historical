					<h1>Just Between Us</h1>

               <p>Your privacy is very important to us here at DivX.com. We don't
               collect a lot of personally identifiable data about you, and what
               we do collect is used only for our internal purposes. We will not
               share any of your personally identifiable information with third
               parties unless we explicitly ask your permission to share it at
               the time you give us the information and you grant us that
               permission or in the case of one of the exceptions noted below.
               All of your information is kept strictly confidential.</p>

               <p>Please read the following summary of how we use your information.
               We may change this policy without advance notification, so please
               check back from time to time.</p><p>

               </p><h3>DivX Account</h3>
               <p>Several services on DivX.com require you to sign up for a DivX
               Account. You can sign up for a DivX Account in four ways: 1) by
               signing up for a DivX .com account; 2) by signing up for the DivX
               News newsletter; 3) by signing up for a DivX Support Account
               within our Support section of DivX.com; or 4) by registering a
               DivX-Certified device (such as a DivX-Certified DVD player),
               which will require you to sign up for a DivX Video-On-Demand
               (VOD) Account. Your DivX Account information is used to enable
               you to access the services you sign up for on DivX.com. Your DivX
               VOD Account enables you to play your favorite DivX VOD movies on
               your DivX Certified devices. If you sign up for our newsletter,
               we will use your email address to send you periodic mailings as
               well as updates on new versions of your DivX software. When you
               sign up for the newsletter, you also have the option to opt-in
               for special offers from our partners. If you do, your email will
               also be used to send you those offers as they are made available.
               (We occasionally send out information on behalf of our partners,
                but we never provide your information to the partners--it always
                remains strictly with us.) You may opt-out of receiving future
               newsletter mailings at any time by changing your DivX Account
               settings. By signing up for any DivX Account, you agree that we
               may send you periodic emails requesting feedback on our services
               in the form of a survey.</p>

               <p>You may optionally tell us more information about you and we will
               associate this information with your DivX Account. For example,
               you may tell us your gender, or what country you live in. In the
               future, this information may be used to show you more relevant
               information when you visit DivX.com (e.g., promotional material).
               If we share this information with third parties, we do so in an
               anonymous way such that your information cannot be uniquely
               identified with you. (For example, we may tell a third party "the
               person on DivX.com is from Germany" so they can display appropriate information. But we
               will not tell them "the person on DivX.com is Mr. Weber, who lives at X address.")</p>

               <p>We reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable
               information about you without your prior consent if we have a
               good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to
               (1) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
               enforceable government request, including subpoenas from private
               parties in a civil action; (2) detect, prevent or otherwise
               address fraud, security or technical issues; (3) enforce the
               provisions of this Privacy Policy or the DivX.com Terms of Use,
               including investigation of potential violations thereof; or (4)
               protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety
               of DivX, its users and/or the public.</p>

               <p>As set out in the DivX.com Terms of Use, DivX.com does not
               intentionally target or direct its services at children under the
               age of thirteen (13), and does not knowingly collect or maintain
               personal information from children under the age of thirteen
               (13).  In addition, DivX.com does not permit any child under the age of thirteen
               (13) to participate in DivX.com communities, including DivX.com message boards.
               If DivX learns that a child under 13 is publicly posting or sharing personally
               identifiable information, such information will be deleted from the Site and
               that user will be blocked from accessing DivX.com.  For more information about
               the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), please see the
               Federal Trade Commission's COPPA-related website.</p>

               <h3>Our Web Site</h3>
               <p>Our web servers record standard HTTP information like your IP address and your
               referrer. This information is not personally identified to you, and is only used
               to optimize our web site performance and plan our future web site
               features.</p>

               <p>Occasionally, we sign agreements with third parties to promote their products on
               DivX.com. In some of these cases, we track referrals from DivX.com that
               subsequently result in product purchases. When one of these campaigns is active,
                you may be assigned a unique tracking number that allows us to
                count the number of referrals that result in purchases. This
                tracking number, while unique across all DivX.com visitors, cannot
                be personally identified with you and is not linked to your DivX
                Account in any way.</p>

                <p>We periodically enter into agreements with third party ad servers
                to show advertisements on DivX.com. These third party servers may
                place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser that we have no
                technical control over. Be sure to read our advertisers' privacy
                policies for more details.</p>

                <h3>Our Products</h3>
                <p>Our products (i.e., DivX速 codec, DivX Pro速 codec, DivX Converter速                application, DivX Player速 application, DivX for Mac
                ) generally do not collect any personally
                identifiable information during installation, save for your email
                address and country of residence should you choose to sign up for
                the DivX News newsletter while registering a product. In this case,
                country information is used to deliver messages that are regionally
                relevant to you (e.g., language of the email). Exceptions to this
                are noted in the sections below.</p>

                <h3>Version checking</h3>
                <p>Once installed on your machine, each of our products will
                occasionally access the Internet to check for new versions. During
                this action, none of your personally identifiable information is
                sent to our servers.</p>

                <h3>Installation</h3>
                After any of our products are installed, the installer will ping
                our web server to record the number of people that have installed
                the software. This information is only used to track the aggregate
                number of installations, and no personally identifiable information
                is recorded on our server.

                <h3>Rotating images</h3>
                <p>The DivX codec and DivX Player application incorporate rotating
                images into their interfaces. The products will update these images
                from time to time by accessing our web servers. When each image is
                displayed, an impression is recorded on our servers, so we can
                track how often each image is viewed. No personally identifiable
                information is stored on our servers during this
                transaction.</p>

                <h3>Purchases</h3>
                <p>When you purchase the DivX Pro or DivX Converter software (for Mac or PC),
                we collect your personal information and your credit card
                information to complete the purchase. We store your personal
                information, but do not store your credit card. The personal
                information you give us during the purchase transaction is used
                only for our internal records and we will not share it with or sell
                it to third parties. If, at the time of purchase, you sign-up to
                receive email, we may use information such as your country to
                deliver messages that are regionally relevant to you.</p>

                <h3>Google</h3>
                <p>The Google-supported version of the DivX Pro codec is bundled with
                the Google Toolbar utility. If you opt-in to install the Google
                Toolbar, the Google Toolbar may collect information about you in
                the course of its activities. Be sure to read Google's privacy
                policy for more details. You are free to uninstall the
                Google-supported version of the DivX Pro codec at any time, which
                will also uninstall the Google Toolbar.</p>

                <h3>DivX Player first time startup</h3>
                <p>The first time you start the DivX Player application, you will be
                guided through a startup process. As a part of this process, you
                will be asked if you would like to send us information about your
                system configuration. You may optionally choose to send us this
                information. A button is provided during the process that allows
                you to review all of the information before it is sent. This
                information is used for diagnostic and product planning purchases
                only, and is stored in a separate database that is not in any way
                linked to personally identifiable information.</p>

                <h3>Product activation</h3>
                <p>The DivX Create products must be unlocked or activated after they
                are purchased. (The free trial versions of the same do not need to be unlocked or activated.) As a part of this
                product activation process, you may be asked to enter your name,
                email and serial number. If the activation is successful, a
                personally identifiable activation code may be recorded on our
                servers. This information is necessary in order for the activation
                to successfully complete. We do not sell or otherwise disclose
                personally identifiable product activation information to third
                parties.</p>

                <h3>Data integrity and security</h3>
                <p>DivX.com uses your personal information only for the purposes for
                which it was collected and only in accordance with this Policy or
                any applicable service-specific privacy notice.  While we take
                reasonable steps to ensure that all personal information we process
                is accurate, complete, and current, we depend on our users to
                update or correct their personal information whenever
                necessary.</p><p>

                </p><p>We are also committed to and do take appropriate security measures
                to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized
                alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These measures
                include but are not limited to internal reviews of our data
                collection, storage and processing practices and security measures,
                as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized
                access to systems where we store personal data.</p>

                <p>We restrict access to personal information to DivX employees,
                contractors and agents who need to know that information in order
                to operate, develop or improve our Site and services.  These
                individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be
                subject to discipline, including termination and criminal
                prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>

                <h3>That's all, folks</h3>
                <p>Thanks for visiting. We at DivX.com value our own privacy, so we
                work hard to protect yours as well. If you ever have any questions,
