<b>Privacy Policy</b><br><br>

Dispop (“Dispop”) is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from users of our Site and Services (as defined in the Terms of Use).<br><br>

<b>1. User Consent.</b><br>

By submitting Personal Data through our Site or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
<b>2. Visitors under the age of 13.</b><br>
Our service is not offered to persons under the age of 13. Thus, we do not intentionally gather Personal Data from visitors who are under the age of 13.
<br><br>
<b>3. Types of Data We Collect</b><br>

“Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
<br><br>
    Information You Provide to Us.
        We may collect Personal Data from you, such as your name, e-mail and mailing addresses, phone number, and password when you create an account with us (“Account”).
        When you make a purchase, we (or our third party service provider) will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information, debit card information, billing information and/or PayPal information.<br><br>
        We retain information on your behalf, such as Design Concepts, Invoice Service invoices, transactional history, messages and any other information that you store using your Account.
        If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.
        When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information.
        When you post messages on our Site, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it.
        We may also collect Personal Data at other points in our Site that state that Personal Data is being collected.
    Information Collected via Technology.<br><br>
        To make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.
        We also use cookies and URL information to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and which you viewed. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. Cookies may enable automatic logins when you visit in the future and may enable content customization.
    Google Analytics.
<br><br>
We currently use Google Analytics as well as Google Analytics for Display Advertising. Google Analytics collects information anonymously and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors. Google Analytics uses its own cookie to track visitor interactions. Website owners can view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with their website so they can improve their website and how people find it. Please see the following links for more information about Google Analytics: http://www.google.com/analytics/, http://www.google.com/privacy.html and http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html. You can also opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising by going to the Google Ads Preferences Manager.
<br><br>
<b>The Opt-Out Cookie &amp; Your Choices</b><br>
Dispop allows consumers to opt out of having online ads tailored using our ad-serving cookie. Blocking and/or opting out of cookies does not stop advertisements from being served to your computer; rather, it prevents data from being associated with your browser. Please note that if you choose an opt-out cookie, we will be unable to recognize your browser from one visit to the next, and you may therefore receive the same ad multiple times.
<br><br>
<a id="optOut" href="//dispop.com">Click here</a> to opt-out from our ad-serving cookie. The cookie will apply to the specific browser you are using; if you wish to opt out for other browsers or computers that you use, you must repeat the process using these browsers or computers.  All other cookies associated with your browser will remain intact and your opt-out will be effective with respect to the browser used as long as you do not delete the cookie file from your hard drive. This opt-out process will erase the cookie ID but not the cookie. It's necessary for us to store this "Keep Out" cookie on your computer in order to recognize you as an opt-out user. Please note that if you erase all cookies from your computer, you will also erase our opt-out cookie and will need to repeat the process of opting out.
<br><br>
<b>4. Use of Your Personal Data</b><br>

    General Use.
<br>
In general, Personal Data you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. We use your Personal Data in the following ways:

    Other Disclosures.
<br>
Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as described below), Dispop may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary (a) in connection with any legal investigation; (b) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Dispop; (c) to protect or defend the rights or property of Dispop or users of the Services; and/or (d) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or Terms of Use.
<br><br>
<b>6. Third Party Websites.</b><br>

When you click on a link to any other website or location, you will leave our Site and go to another site and another entity may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on links to such outside websites
<br><br>

        Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you service related communication, including notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy.
    Changes to Personal Data.
<br>
You may change any of your Personal Data in your Account by editing your profile within your Account or contacting us via the Site. You may request deletion of your Personal Data by us, but please note that we may be required to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives. We may retain your information for fraud prevention or similar purposes.
<br><br>
<b>8. Security of Your Personal Data.</b><br>

Dispop is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data.
