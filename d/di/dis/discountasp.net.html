Then we will collect your contact information (such as name, company, email, address and phone number) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). We collect the same information for services that do not require a domain name. </p>

<p><strong>User Data Supplementation</strong></p>
<p>We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, and combine this data with information we already have about you.  This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you.  If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.</p>
<p>Examples of the types of personal information that may be obtained from public sources or purchased from third parties and combined with information we already have about you, may include purchased marketing data about our customers from third parties that is combined with information we already have about you, to create more tailored advertising and products</p>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p>

<p><strong>Updating/Accessing/Amending/Correcting Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>Upon request DiscountASP.NET will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. If your personally identifiable information changes, you may correct, update, or delete inaccuracies through the Control Panel located at <a href="https://my.discountasp.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://my.discountasp.net</a> for web hosting customers and at <a href="https://mytfs.discountasp.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://mytfs.discountasp.net</a> for Team Foundation Server hosting customers.

<p><strong>Other disclosures</strong></p>
<p>DiscountASP.NET does not share, sell, rent or trade your personally identifiable information with third parties other than as disclosed within this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Agents/Service Providers</strong></p>
<p>In the course of providing the services to you, we use the services of third parties, such as credit card processing companies, to bill you for goods and services, a survey provider to send out surveys on our behalf, and a mass email provider to manage specific opt-in email lists. We also use a third party service provider software that we use to host our Support Portal. </p>
<p>When you order a new domain name, we will share your name, address, email and phone number with our domain registrar partner as necessary for the third party to provide that service. </p>
<p>In certain situations, DiscountASP.NET may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes. We are required to comply with relevant laws, regulations and judicial orders. Information covered by this Privacy Policy, as well as other categories of information, may be disclosed to third parties if we determine that such a disclosure is required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web site; when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety and the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>
<p>It is possible that we may need to provide personally identifiable information to third party vendors that we use in order to provide our services â for example, we provide Microsoft based web hosting. It is possible that should we encounter an issue or bug with Microsoft software that can only be resolved by Microsoft, we may need to share personally identifiable information with Microsoft in order to replicate, troubleshoot and resolve the issue. Similarly, we offer email services using SmarterTools SmarterMail product. It is possible that we could encounter an email issue that must be researched by SmarterTools in order to provide us with a resolution, thus requiring us to provide SmarterTools with personally identifiable information. In these situations, we first ask the customer if we can share personally identifiable information with the third party. </p>
