    <strong>Information we collect</strong> 
    <br><br>
    <strong>Orders</strong><br>
    If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. For our web hosting services, you must first provide your domain name or a domain name you wish to purchase. Then we will collect contact information (such as name, company, email, address and phone number) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).  For any services that do not require a domain name, we will collect contact information (such as name, company, email, address and phone number) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).  
    <br><br>
    We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders, to market new products and services to you, and to send you general information (like newsletters) that we think you will be interested in. This Order Information may be aggregated to create an administrative record that includes information related to the products and services provided to you, how you use those services, problems related to the services and notations from our staff about our relationship with you, among other things. 
    <br><br>
    If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.
    <br><br>            
    <strong>Secure Registration Information Collection</strong><br>
    The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter personal information as well as sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms and account management interfaces (like the control panel), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  
    <br><br>
    We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
    <br><br>
    If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at <a href="mailto:support@discountasp.net">support@discountasp.net</a>.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Customer Inquiries</strong><br>
    If you contact us about a problem/issue or with a question we may ask you for specific information related to this contact (Customer Inquiry Information). 
    <br><br>
    <strong>Statistical Information</strong><br>
    All of our servers collect statistical information such as your IP address, date you visited, computer you are using, and operating system, among other data (Statistical Information). This information does not identify individual users. We use this information to analyze trends and understand demographic information about our user base so that we can improve our services and usability of our services.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Third Party Products and Services</strong><br>
    We offer some products and services that are provided by third parties (Third Party Products). These Third Party Products may collect and use information in ways that differ from those set out in this Privacy Policy. We will provide you with links to the websites of the providers of Third Party Products on your written request. 
    <br><br>
    <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
    A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.  
    <br><br>
    We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to change the way our Web site looks to you and to collect demographic data about where visitors to our Web site go and how they behave.  A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. 
    <br><br>
    We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once and to keep you logged in to certain areas of the Web site.  Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.  
    <br><br>
    You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file, but be aware that this may disable some of the functionality on our web site.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Third Party Cookies</strong><br>
    You may visit third party sites that place cookies on your computer for entities that provide Third Party Services to us. When you visit our site, those third parties may be able to determine which other sites containing their cookies you have visited, in addition to visiting our site. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy statement.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.  
    <br><br>
    <strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong><br>
    We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you may opt-out by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each email.
    If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication and opting out through your control panel at <a href="https://my.discountasp.net" target="_blank">https://my.discountasp.net</a>.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Customer Inquiries</strong><br>
    We use Customer Inquiry Information to identify you individually. It is used throughout our business to provide services to you. Customer Inquiry Information may be associated with your Order Information to provide services to you. Customer Inquiry Information is shared with third parties in the following circumstances: to identify and fix problems with services when we are not capable of doing so ourselves. For more information on who we may share your information with, please see the “Other Disclosures” section below. 
    <br><br>
    <strong>Statistical Information</strong><br>
    We use statistical information to operate our hardware and software, diagnose problems and administer our web site. We may use aggregate information to modify the products and services we offer based on who is visiting our web site, and what they are purchasing. We do not use this data to identify you individually. 
    <br><br>
    <strong>Updating/Accessing/Amending/Correcting Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
    If your personally identifiable information changes, you may correct, update, or delete inaccuracies through the Control Panel located at <a href="https://my.discountasp.net" target="_blank">https://my.discountasp.net</a>. If you are having trouble accessing the Control Panel, our customer support team can assist and they can be contacted at <a href="mailto:support@discountasp.net">support@discountasp.net</a>. 
    <br><br>
    <strong>Other disclosures</strong><br>
    DiscountASP.NET does not share, sell, rent or trade your personal information with third parties other than as disclosed within this privacy policy.     
     <br><br>
     <strong>Agents/Service Providers</strong>  <br>
    We use other third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services, a survey provider to send out surveys on our behalf, and a mass email provider to manage specific opt-in email lists.  We also use a third party service provider software that we use to host our Support Portal. 
    <br><br>
    When you order a new domain name, we will share your name, address, email and phone number with OpenSRS (our domain registrar partner) as necessary for the third party to provide that service.  
    <br><br>
    These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes. 
    We are required to comply with relevant laws, regulations and judicial orders. Information covered by this Privacy Policy, as well as other categories of information, may be disclosed to third parties if we determine that such a disclosure is required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site. 
     <br><br>
     It is possible that we may need to provide personally identifiable information to third party vendors that we use in order to provide our services – for example, we provide Microsoft based web hosting. It is possible that should we encounter an issue or bug with Microsoft software that can only be resolved by Microsoft – we may need to share personally identifiable information with Microsoft in order to replicate, troubleshoot and resolve the issue. Similarly, we offer email services using SmarterTools SmarterMail product. It is possible that we could encounter an email issue that must be researched by SmarterTools in order to provide us with a resolution – which may require us to provide SmarterTools with personally identifiable information. We first ask the customer if we can share personally identifiable information with the third party to help seek a resolution to these issues.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Business Transitions</strong><br>
    In the event DiscountASP.NET goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.  You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Forum / Blog</strong><br>
    If you use our forum or blog you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Customer Testimonials</strong><br>
    We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain Personally Identifiable Information.  We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial. 

    <br><br>
    <strong>Surveys</strong><br>
    We may use third parties to conduct survey’s on our behalf. These surveys will use your email address to send you the survey information and links.  Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the email contains an out-out option.
    <br><br>
    We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys; that company is prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose.  We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice. 
    <br><br>
    <strong>Research Papers/Publications</strong><br>
    We do publish research papers based on survey data. However, the research paper includes aggregate data and does not include any Personally Identifiable Information. Should we include any Personally Identifiable Information, we would first ask the customer.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Changes in this Privacy Statement</strong><br>
    If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement at http://discountasp.net/userpolicy_privacy.aspx, the control panel, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
