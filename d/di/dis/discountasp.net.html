    <strong>Information we collect</strong> 
    <br><br>
    <strong>Order Information</strong><br>
If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form (Order Information). For our web hosting services, you must first provide your domain name or a domain name you wish to purchase. Then we will collect your contact information (such as name, company, email, address and phone number) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). We collect the same information for services that do not require a domain name.
    <br><br>
We collect information under the direction of its Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the Client that you interact with directly.  We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients. 
    <br><br>
We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders, to market new products and services to you, and to send you general information (like newsletters) that we think you will be interested in. This Order Information may be aggregated to create an administrative record that includes information related to the products and services provided to you, how you use those services, problems related to the services and notations from our staff about our relationship with you, among other things. 
    <br><br>
If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. 
    <br><br>            
    <strong>Secure Registration Information Collection</strong><br>
    The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. When you enter personally identifiable information as well as sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms and account management interfaces (like the control panel), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  
    <br><br>
    We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 
    <br><br>
    If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at  <a href="mailto:support@discountasp.net">support@discountasp.net</a>.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Data Retention</strong><br>
    We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer provide you services contact us at  
    <a href="mailto:billing@discountasp.net">billing@discountasp.net</a>.  
    We will retain your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 
    <br><br>   
    <strong>Statistical Information</strong><br>
   All of our servers collect statistical information such as your IP address, date you visited, computer you are using, and operating system, among other data (Statistical Information). This information does not identify individual users. We use this information to analyze trends and understand demographic information about our user base so that we can improve our services and usability of our services.  
    <br><br>
    We may use Statistical Information to operate our hardware and software, diagnose problems and administer our web site. We may also use aggregate information to modify the products and services we offer based on who is visiting our web site, and what they are purchasing. We do not use this data to identify you individually.  
    <br><br>
    <strong>Third Party Products and Services</strong><br>
    We offer some products and services that are provided by third parties (Third Party Products). These Third Party Products may collect and use information in ways that differ from those set out in this Privacy Policy. We will provide you with links to the websites of the providers of Third Party Products on your written request. 
    <br><br>
    <strong>Cookies</strong><br>

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.  
   <br><br>
   
   <strong>Tracking Technologies</strong><br>
   Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by DiscountASP.NET and our marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics or security service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.<br><br>
    <strong>Analytics / Log files</strong><br>
    As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. 
    We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.    
        <br><br>
    
    <strong>Local Storage (HTML)</strong><br>
	Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSs such as HTML 5 to collect and store information.
    Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.<br><br>
    
        <strong>Behavioral Targeting</strong><br>
We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>  (or if located in the European Union click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a> ) Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads.  You will continue to receive generic ads.<br><br>
    <strong>Google AdSense/Adwords</strong><br>
We use Google AdSense to advertise this site.  When you view or click on an ad a cookie will be set to help better provide advertisements that may be of interest to you on other Web sites.   You may opt-out of the use of this cookie by visiting <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google’s Advertising and Privacy page</a>.<br><br>
    <strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong><br>
    We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you may opt-out by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each email. 
    <br><br>    
    <strong>Customer Inquiries</strong><br>
    If you contact us about a problem/issue or with a question, we may ask you for specific information related to this contact (Customer Inquiry Information). We use Customer Inquiry Information to identify you individually. It is used throughout our business to provide services to you. Customer Inquiry Information may be associated with your Order Information to provide services to you. Customer Inquiry Information is shared with third parties to identify and fix problems with services when we are not capable of doing so ourselves. For more information on who we may share your information with, please see the “Other Disclosures” section below.    
    <br><br>   
    <strong>Updating/Accessing/Amending/Correcting Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
    Upon request DiscountASP.NET will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information.  
    If your personally identifiable information changes, you may correct, update, or delete inaccuracies through the Control Panel located at  <a href="https://my.discountasp.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://my.discountasp.net</a> for web hosting customers and at <a href="https://mytfs.discountasp.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://mytfs.discountasp.net</a> for Team Foundation Server hosting customers.

    <strong>Other disclosures</strong><br>
    DiscountASP.NET does not share, sell, rent or trade your personally identifiable information with third parties other than as disclosed within this Privacy Policy.          
     <br><br>     
     <strong>Agents/Service Providers</strong>  <br>
    In the course of providing the services to you, we use the services of third parties, such as credit card processing companies, to bill you for goods and services, a survey provider to send out surveys on our behalf, and a mass email provider to manage specific opt-in email lists. We also use a third party service provider software that we use to host our Support Portal.  
    <br><br>

Information covered by this Privacy Policy, as well as other categories of information, may be disclosed to third parties if we determine that such a disclosure is required by law,
    such as to comply with a subpoena, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web site; when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety and the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. 
     <br><br>
     It is possible that we may need to provide personally identifiable information to third party vendors that we use in order to provide our services – for example, we provide Microsoft based web hosting. It is possible that should we encounter an issue or bug with Microsoft software that can only be resolved by Microsoft, we may need to share personally identifiable information with Microsoft in order to replicate, troubleshoot and resolve the issue. Similarly, we offer email services using SmarterTools SmarterMail product. It is possible that we could encounter an email issue that must be researched by SmarterTools in order to provide us with a resolution, thus requiring us to provide SmarterTools with personally identifiable information. In these situations, we first ask the customer if we can share personally identifiable information with the third party.
