                        <p>THIS IS OUR OFFICIAL PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH IS PART OF OUR TERMS OF USE AND FORMS A PART OF YOUR LEGAL AGREEMENT WITH US. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY SINCE IT DESCRIBES THE TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION, THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE DISCLOSE OR SHARE INFORMATION AND HOW YOU CAN ACCESS, UPDATE OR DELETE CERTAIN INFORMATION WE HAVE COLLECTED ABOUT YOU, OR, IF YOU HAVE CONSENTED, YOUR CHILD IF THEY ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OLD (REFERRED TO INDIVIDUALLY AND/OR COLLECTIVELY AS "YOU"). </p>
                        <p><strong>Any terms not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in our <a href="/tou">Terms of Use</a>.</strong></p>
                        <h4>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</h4>
                        <p>When you access or visit any of our Websites, we and our operational service providers and others who host our Websites often use technology that can recognize, collect and/or transmit information that is associated with you, but which do not personally identify you. Although the term "cookie" specifically refers to a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes, we will use the term "cookie" to refer generically to any technology that can recognize, collect and/or transmit information about your visits to our Websites. This type of information includes such data as the Internet or web domain that referred you, the type of operating system and browser you are using, the date and time of your visit, data relating to activities on our Websites (e.g., so-called ‘clickstream' data) and other technological attributes about your visit to our Websites. This information is used to analyze trends, administer our Websites, track user movements on our Websites, and gather aggregate demographic information about visitors so we can continually improve our Websites. <br>
                        Cookies also allow our Websites to recognize a users' computer or access device each time it is used to visit a particular Website and cookies can keep count of how often you return. Cookies can also track how you use our Websites, your preferences for features and functions and, for Websites that have registration or similar features, cookies can store information such as your user name and password so you don't have to re-enter them each time you return to visit. Cookies don't personally identify you or any particular user or individual. <br>
                        You can disable or turn the cookie feature off by changing the settings on your Internet browser and you can also change the settings to stop your browser from automatically accepting cookies. Although changing these settings may not affect your ability to browse, it may affect your ability to use certain features and functions of our Websites and it may also require you to re-enter certain information each time you visit or attempt to use our Websites. You should consult the operating instructions that apply to your browser to determine how to best configure your browser settings for your needs.</p>
                        <h4>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>

You may also email us with a question or for more information and we will use your contact information (which includes Personal Information such as an email address) to help us respond and for customer service purposes. Unless you voluntary provide or send us Personal Information, we will always ask you to submit or provide it to us before collecting your Personal Information, although you may not be able to use the particular Content, if you choose not to provide your Personal Information. If you provide or submit your Personal Information to any of our Websites, we will always give you the right to review, update and/or delete your Personal Information, subject to our obligations to comply with legal, regulatory our internal audit and record-keeping requirements. </p>

These are within their control and not ours and the terms and conditions, as well as the privacy policies that apply to these Third Parties and their websites are their responsibility, not ours. </p>
                        <h3>Disclosure to Third Parties</h3>
                        <p>We do not sell, rent, lease, provide or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to unaffiliated entities unless the Supplemental Privacy Policy that applies to your use of a particular Website. We will always let you know if we intend to provide any of your Personal Information to a Third Party, you will always have an opportunity to read and review the Supplemental Privacy Policy that applies and we will ask you to consent ("Opt in") whenever we intend to do so. <br>
                        We always have the right to disclose your Personal Information to any Third Party we engage for the purpose of administering, operating, configuring site design, maintaining and providing internal support for our Websites and Content on our Websites. These Third Parties are called operational service providers that provide internal support to operations and activities and/or for Site design, development, hosting and operations.

                        <ul>
                            <li>When we are compelled by a governmental agency, law, regulation, a court or other legal process; </li>
                            <li>If we believe you are, have or may violate any law, regulation, our <a href="/tou">Terms of Use</a>;</li>

                        <p>You should also be aware we are public service organization and simply because a website or web page includes our logo, name or otherwise refers to us, does not mean the website or web page is ours or under our control. We work with sponsors, advertisers and government agencies to bring you public service advertising and if you enter, provide or submit Personal Information on or to a co-branded website or web page you may be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Third Party sponsor, advertiser, government agency or co-branding organization.</p>
                        <h4>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h4>

                        <h4>YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING Personal Information.</h4>
                        <p>In addition to any terms, conditions or rights that are described in any Supplemental Privacy Policy applicable to particular Websites, you always have the right to request that: (i) we correct or update your Personal Information; (ii) we not share your Personal Information with third parties; or (iii) your Personal Information be removed from our active marketing databases. Although we will usually provide you with the ability to update or delete Personal Information directly online, some Personal Information may not be changed or deleted by you and requires you to contact us for verification (e.g., birth date, email address, name). The Supplemental Privacy Policy that applies to the Website will provide you with the email address or contact information that applies to that Website so that you can contact us with a request to change that type of information. </p>

All requests sent via postal mail must be labeled "Your California Privacy Rights" on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request.

For general questions about our Privacy Policies please email us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@adcouncil.org">webmaster@adcouncil.org</a> or write us to the attention of our Privacy Administrator, at The Advertising Council, 815 Second Ave., New York, NY 10017, and please specify if you are inquiring about a specific Website to help us better assist and respond to your questions.</p>

You will be required to provide us with certain information about you during the registration process and in order to allow us to give you access to Services generally not available to others, you will also be required to choose a user name and password (or we may assign an initial password, which we will give you the option to change after you register). Once we confirm we have received all the information required for registration we will confirm that you have become a "Registered User" of that Website and you will need to log in to that Website using your unique user name and password combination which we will refer to as your User ID.<br>Unless we indicate otherwise during the registration process for any particular Website, you must live in the United States and either be at least 13 years old, or provide verifiable adult consent in advance from a parent or legal guardian ("parent") to use the Services associated with that particular Website. If you are at least 13 years old, but you are not yet considered an adult where you live (generally age 18) you can only enroll and become a Registered User if you get consent from your parent. If you are under 13, and have not provided advance verifiable consent from a parent, you may not enroll, register, become a Registered User or use our Services at all.</p>
                        <h4>KEEPING YOUR PASSWORD SAFE</h4>
                        <p>Your User ID is personal and you must keep it strictly confidential. Don't give it to anyone or allow others to use it because you are solely responsible for anything and everything that can be connected to, associated with or traced to your User ID, including, without limitation, any and all fees, costs and charges, liability and damages. You agree to immediately notify us if you become aware or believe there is or may have been any unauthorized use of your user name or password or any other need to deactivate your User ID due to security concerns.  You, not us, are solely responsible and liable for the use of your User ID by you or anyone else and you will defend and indemnify us as described in the section of our <a href="/tou">Terms of Use</a> entitled "You Are Indemnifying Us" for any damage or harm resulting from your User ID.  </p>
                        <h4>TERMINATION OF YOUR REGISTRATION</h4>
                        <p>You can terminate your registration on any of our Websites by following the instructions we provide on that Website, subject to any particular obligations you previously agreed to and which have not yet been fully performed, fulfilled or completed. We may terminate your use of and registration on any of our Websites, at any time without any liability or further obligation of any kind whatsoever to you or any other party.</p>
