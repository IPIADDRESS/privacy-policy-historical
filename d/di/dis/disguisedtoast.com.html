<section>
<p class="dt-article-paragraph">8.1 In this Section 8, we have summarised the rights that you have under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.
8.2 Your principal rights under data protection law are:</p><ul class="dt-article-list"><li><p class="dt-article-paragraph">(a)   the right to access;</p></li>
<li><p class="dt-article-paragraph">(b)   the right to rectification;</p></li>
<li><p class="dt-article-paragraph">(c)   the right to erasure;</p></li>
<li><p class="dt-article-paragraph">(d)   the right to restrict processing;</p></li>
<li><p class="dt-article-paragraph">(e)   the right to object to processing;</p></li>
<li><p class="dt-article-paragraph">(f)   the right to data portability;</p></li>
<li><p class="dt-article-paragraph">(g)   the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and</p></li>
<li><p class="dt-article-paragraph">(h)   the right to withdraw consent.</p></li>
</ul><p class="dt-article-paragraph">8.3 You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee. Provision of such information will be subject to: </p><ul class="dt-article-list"><li><p class="dt-article-paragraph">(a)   the first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies will be subjected to a CAD 10 administration fee; and</p></li>
<li><p class="dt-article-paragraph">(b)   the supply of appropriate evidence of your identity (for this purpose, we will usually accept a photocopy of your passport certified by a solicitor or bank plus an original copy of a utility bill showing your current address).</p></li>
</ul><p class="dt-article-paragraph">8.4 You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.</p><p class="dt-article-paragraph">8.5 In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p><p class="dt-article-paragraph">8.6 In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.</p><p class="dt-article-paragraph">8.7 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p><p class="dt-article-paragraph">8.8 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose.</p><p class="dt-article-paragraph">8.9 If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.</p><p class="dt-article-paragraph">8.10    To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.</p><p class="dt-article-paragraph">8.11    You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by contacting us using the details outlined in section 13.</p>
