<p class="story" style="mso-outline-level: 1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman'">Information collected from you with technology </span></p>
<p class="copy"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Discover.com uses information collected through technology to make our Web site more interesting and useful to you. In some circumstances, it may not be readily apparent to you that such information is being collected. For instance, when you come to Discover.com, your IP address is collected. An IP address is often associated with the</span><span style="color: red; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">portal through</span><span style="color: red; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">which you enter the Internet, like your </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">ISP</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"> (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally-identifying. </span></p>
<p class="copy"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">At times we also collect information regarding the frequency with which our visitors visit various parts of Discover.com and where on our Web site they visit, as well as information regarding our visitors' responses to e-mails that we send to them. We may combine the information collected from you with technology, including your IP address, with personally-identifying information to identify a visitor in order to provide relevant content, ads, and e-mails to that visitor, as well as to enforce compliance with our Terms and Conditions, and to protect our service, Web site, visitors, and other parties. </span></p>

<p class="copy"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web site. These pieces of information allow the Web site to remember important information that will make your use of that site more efficient. Web site operators use cookies for a variety of purposes. For instance, when you return to Discover.com, cookies enable our site to remember who you are, so you don't have to log in again. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser "Help" menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your Web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of the services of Discover.com may not function properly. </span></p>
<p class="copy">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="copy"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Discover.com also may use Web beacons (which are also known as clear GIFS). Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites. We may use Web beacons to send cookies to your computer. We also may use Web beacons to analyze the traffic patterns on our Web site, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Web site. The Web beacons on Discover.com may send data either directly from us or from another party authorized by us, and these Web beacons may transmit information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. This information is not collected, however, in a form that is personally-identifying. In addition, we use Web beacons in HTML e-mails that we send our members, in order to determine whether our members have opened those e-mails. This information may be gathered in a form that is personally-identifying. Finally, network advertisers who place advertisements on our Web site may also use Web beacons in accordance with their privacy policies. In some cases, we may have access to information from Web beacons and cookies used by network advertisers on our Web site, and this information may permit us to determine the identity of other sites that you have visited that are also associated with the network advertiser. </span></p>

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information collected from you offline. For example, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information you provide when you subscribe by postal mail or telephone to Discover Magazine or to information that you provide to Discover Magazine when you respond by postal mail or telephone to a survey. These examples are not meant to be exhaustive, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to many other instances in which Discover Magazine may collect information from you offline.</p>

<p class="copy">A3: Discover Magazine uses personally-identifying information that it has collected in a number of ways. One of the ways we use such information is to send you updates and provide you information about Discover.com. We may also use your personal information to complete transactions, such as processing orders for Discover.com, or to send you administrative communications about any account you may have with us or about future changes to this Privacy Policy. If you contact us for help, we will use your personally-identifying information to respond to you.

<p class="copy">Various companies assist us with the operation of Discover.com. Other companies help us fulfill your subscription orders and process your requests concerning Discover.com, or help us communicate with you or assist us in gathering your information. Except as otherwise permitted by other provisions of this Privacy Policy, all of these companies are allowed to gather, receive, and use your information, but only for purposes connected with Discover.com. For example, we may hire companies to help deliver products or services, like a shipping company that delivers a package. In these instances, there is a need to share your information with these companies.</p>

Network advertisers who place these advertisements may also use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally-identifying information when you click on or move your cursor over one of their banner advertisements. You may not realize this information is being collected. In some cases, we may have access to information from Web beacons and cookies used by network advertisers on our Web site and this information may permit us to identify other Web sites that you have visited that are also associated with the network advertiser. Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement and have left our Web site, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their Web site. The advertiser's privacy policy may differ from ours. You must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on its Web site.</p>

<p class="copy">A7: The security of your personally-identifying information is an important concern for us. We take technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps to protect all visitors' personal information. When you provide credit card information, we use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect it. However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. There are some things that you can do to help protect the security of your information. For instance, never give out your password, since this is what is used to access all of your account information. Also, remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you finish surfing the Web, so that other people using the same computer won't have access to your information. </p>
