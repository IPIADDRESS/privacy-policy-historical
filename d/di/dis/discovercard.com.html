	<br><br>
	Our mission is to provide you with superior products and services, along with 
	the peace of mind knowing that your privacy is secure. We understand your 
	concerns about guarding information about you and your Account. We want to 
	assure you that we have taken steps, and will continue to take steps, to 
	safeguard that information.
	<br><br>
	This Privacy Policy describes our efforts to meet these objectives. It 
	includes a summary of the following important information: 
	<ul class="nomargin">
	<li>A listing of the personal information we collect</li>
	<li>The circumstances in which we may share information with others</li>
	<li>The ways we safeguard the confidentiality and security of information</li>
	<li>The steps you may take to limit our sharing of such information with others. See
	Section 4 for complete details.</li>
	</ul>
	Please read our Privacy Policy carefully. It will help you understand how we collect and
	share information.</span>
	<br><br>
	<span class="bodymediumSubtitle">1. What Personal Information Do We Collect?</span>
	<br><br>
	<span class="bodymediumText">
	To serve you better and manage our business, it is important that we collect 
	and maintain accurate personal information about you. We obtain this 
	information from applications and other forms you submit to us, from your 
	dealings with us and others, from consumer reporting agencies, and from other 
	sources, such as our Web sites. For example:<br>
	<ul class="nomargin">
	<li>We may obtain information such as your name, address and date of birth 
	from applications and other forms you submit to us.</li> 
  	<li>We may obtain information such as Account balances, payment history, 
	your use of your Account and the types of services you prefer from your 
	transactions and other dealings with us and others.</li>
  	<li>We may obtain information such as the balances of your loans with other 
	lenders and your payment history with others from consumer reporting agencies.</li>
  	<li>We may obtain information such as your Internet service provider, your 
	domain name, your computer's operating system and Web browser, your Web site 
	use and your product and service preferences from your visits to our Web sites.</li></ul></span>
	<br>
	<span class="bodymediumSubtitle">2. Is Personal Information Shared with Others?</span>
	<br><br>
	<span class="bodymediumText">
	We limit the sharing of information with others. Many of the offers you receive 
	for products and services are provided directly to you from us. For example, a 
	retailer that accepts the Discover<sup>®</sup> Card may come to us with a special offer 
	for Cardmembers, such as a discount certificate or product upgrade. After 
	careful consideration of the nature of the offer and the company, we will 
	create a list of Cardmembers who may be interested in the offer based on 
	certain characteristics. We will send the offer directly to those Cardmembers 
	on behalf of the retailer by, for example, including an insert in their monthly 
	billing statement or mailing the offer ourselves. We control the information 
	used to make the offer; we do not share the list or any information about 
	our Cardmembers with the retailer. However, please understand that if you do 
	receive this type of offer from us and choose to take advantage of it, the 
	retailer may then learn information about you because only Cardmembers with 
	certain characteristics received the offer.
	<br><br>
	There are, however, circumstances in which we may share the information we 
	collect about you, as described in Section 1, with other companies in order 
	to provide you with access to products and services and to service your 
	Account effectively, as detailed below. We require these companies to adhere 
	to our privacy standards and to use this information only for the limited 
	purpose for which it was shared. We do not allow them to disclose it to 
	others without our prior approval. 
	<br><br>
	a. Sharing Personal Information with Our Corporate Family
	<br><br>
	We are part of the Morgan Stanley family of companies. Our corporate family 
	offers a wide variety of products and services that can help you manage your 
	finances. In order to provide you with access to these products and services, 
	we may share the information we collect about you, as described in Section 1, 
	with other members of our corporate family. These companies include financial 
	service providers that offer mortgage lending services, securities and asset 
	management services, investment opportunities and mutual funds, and may 
	include non-financial service providers in the future as our corporate 
	family continues to grow.
	<br><br>
	b. Sharing Personal Information with Non-Affiliated Parties for Marketing Purposes 
	<br><br>
	We may share the information we collect about you, as described in Section 1, 
	with non-affiliated third parties, including those that accept the Discover 
	Card, in order to provide you with access to products and services offered 
	directly by these companies that may be of value to you. These companies include 
	financial service providers, such as insurance companies, and non-financial 
	companies, such as retailers.
	<br><br>
	c. Sharing Personal Information with Others
	<br><br>
	We may share the information we collect about you, as described in Section 1, 
	with companies that perform support or marketing services on our behalf, such 
	as mailing, market research and data processing; other financial institutions 
	with which we have joint marketing agreements; or companies that are our 
	partners for cobrand credit card programs or reward programs. We may also 
	share such information as permitted by law. </span>
	<br><br>
	<span class="bodymediumSubtitle">3. How Do We Protect the Confidentiality, 
	Security and Integrity of Information About You?</span>
	<br><br>
	<span class="bodymediumText">
	We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the 
	information we collect about you. Access to such information is restricted 
	to individuals who need it in order to service your Account or provide 
	products and services to you, and who are trained in the proper handling 
	of such information. Employees who violate these confidentiality requirements 
	are subject to our disciplinary process. Where third parties provide support 
	services, we require them to conform to our privacy standards.
	<br><br>
	It is important that the information we maintain about you is accurate and 
	complete. If you see information in your monthly billing statements or elsewhere 
	which suggests that our information is incomplete or inaccurate, please write 
	to us at Discover Card, P.O. Box 30943, Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0943 so 
	that we can update this information. </span>
	<br><br>
	<span class="bodymediumSubtitle">4. How Can You Limit Sharing of Information About You?</span>
	<br><br>
	<span class="bodymediumText">
	We respect your privacy and offer you choices as to whether we may share 
	information about you with others. If you prefer that we not share the information 
	we collect about you, as described in Section 1, with non-affiliated third 
	parties or if you prefer that we not share that information with companies in 
	our corporate family, you may opt out, that is, you may direct us not to 
	share that information. If you indicate a preference that we do not share 
	that information, please understand that you will not receive offers for 
	products and services provided by other companies that could help you lower 
	your costs, maximize your financial resources and manage your finances.
	<br><br>
	<strong>To indicate your preferences, call us at 1-800-225-5202 
	or write to us at Discover Card, P.O. Box 30961, Salt Lake City, UT 
	84130-0961. If you have previously notified us about your privacy preferences, 
	it is not necessary to do so again unless you decide to change your 
	preferences.</strong> Your written request should include your name, 
	address, telephone number and Account number(s) and should not be sent 
	with any other correspondence. In order to process your request, we require 
	that the request be provided by you directly and not through a third 
	party. You will need to provide us with your preferences for each credit 
	card account you have with us.
	<br><br>
	You may notify us about your preferences at any time. If you have previously 
	notified us, it is not necessary to do so again unless you decide to change 
	your preferences. Your request will remain in effect until you notify us 
	otherwise. We will honor your request and not share the information we collect 
	about you, except as permitted by law. For example, federal law permits us 
	to share information about you with consumer reporting agencies, service 
	providers and marketing partners. It also permits us to share information 
	about our experiences and transactions with you, such as your Account balance 
	and payment history, with other members of our corporate family. If you are 
	a new Cardmember, we will not share any information about you, except as 
	permitted by law, for thirty days after we provide this Policy to you in 
	order to give you an opportunity to inform us about your preferences. If 
	you are an existing Cardmember, please understand that you may continue to 
	receive marketing offers directly from other companies that were already 
	in production prior to the processing of your request.
	<br><br>
	This Privacy Policy is provided to the primary Cardmember listed on the 
	Account. However, any joint Cardmember has the right to notify us about 
	preferences and we will treat that request as applying to the entire 
	Account. We do not share information about former customers, except as 
	permitted by law.
	<br><br>
	This Privacy Policy is provided to you by Discover Bank 
	and its subsidiaries, which currently include GTC Insurance Agency, Inc. It 
	applies to the Discover Platinum, Discover Gold, Discover Classic and Discover 
	Titanium Cards, and the products and services 	offered in connection with those cards, 
	including The Register<sup>®</sup> card registration service (with the exception 
	of any information registered in connection with the service, which will not be shared). 
	It is part of your Cardmember Agreement and provides a further explanation of how we 
	collect and share information. You may have other rights under state laws that apply 
	to this information. Please note that you will also receive privacy notices for other 
	credit card accounts you have with us, as well as other financial products and services 
	provided to you by us and our affiliates. You will need to indicate your 
	preferences for each of these separately as disclosed in the notice.</span>
	<br><br>
	
	<span class="bodymediumText">
	<strong>Vermont and North Dakota Residents</strong> — Your state laws require
	financial institutions to obtain your consent prior to sharing information about you
	with others. Except as permitted by law, we will not share information we collect
	about you with non-affiliated third parties or, if you are a Vermont resident, with
	companies in our corporate family unless you call us at 1-800-DISCOVER and authorize
	us to do so.
