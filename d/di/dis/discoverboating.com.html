    <p>Your privacy is a priority at Discover Boating, and we go to great lengths to protect it. We recognize your need
        to
        protect and manage any personal information you share with us. Please take a moment to read the following to
        learn
        more about our information practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is
        used
        and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your personal information.</p>

    <h3>Children's Privacy Statement</h3>

    <p>To protect the privacy of children, we adhere to the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). For
        more
        information, visit the Federal Trade Commission's COPPA site at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens.html" class="electric-link" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens.html</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

    <p>There are situations in which your personal information may help us give you better service. For example, we may
        ask
        for your personal information when you order a Free "How to Get Started with Boating" DVD, sign up for the Wave
        Newsletter, get Free Magazine Subscriptions or fill out a form to receive brochures and materials. At such
        times, we
        may collect personal information relevant to the situation, such as your name, mailing address, phone number,
        email
        address, and contact preferences. In some cases, we also ask you to provide information for market research
        purposes
        to gain a better understanding of our customers and thus provide more valuable service.</p>

    <h3>Website Traffic</h3>

    <p>As most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information
        includes
        internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating
        system, date/time, and clickstream data.</p>

    <p>We use this information, which DOES NOT identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to
        track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
        This
        helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to understand which parts of our
        websites and Internet services are of most interest to them.</p>

    <h3>Cookies</h3>

    <p>As is standard practice on many corporate websites, DiscoverBoating.com uses "cookies" and other technologies to
        help
        us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time
        they
        spend there. We also use cookies and other technologies to make sure that our online advertising is bringing
        customers to our website. And we use cookies to customize your experience and provide greater convenience each
        time
        you interact with us.</p>

    <p>If you prefer not to enable cookies, please go to <a href="http://www.discoverboating.com/info/cookies.htm" class="electric-link" target="_blank">www.discoverboating.com/info/cookies.htm</a>,
        which explains step by step how you can disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the
        DiscoverBoating.com website will not be available once cookies are disabled.</p>

    <h3>Newsletter</h3>

    <p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as your name and email
        address.While
        we cannot prevent users from signing up other individuals to receive the newsletter, out of respect for our
        users'
        privacy, we provide a way for you to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out section
        below.</p>

    <p>In some of our email messages we use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the DiscoverBoating.com website.
        When
        a customer clicks one of these URLs, they pass through a web server before arriving at the destination web page.
        We
        track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness
        of
        our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the
        email.</p>

    <p>In addition, we sometimes use pixel tags - tiny graphic images - to tell us what parts of our website customers
        have
        visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site. Pixel tags also enable us to
        send
        email messages in a format customers can read. And they tell us whether emails have been opened to assure that
        we're
        only sending messages that are of interest to you.</p>

    <h3>Information Disclosure</h3>

    <p>The National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA) is the sole keeper of the information collected on the
        discoverboating.com website and any other programs related to the Discover Boating campaign.</p>

    <h3>When we disclose your information</h3>

    <p>We take your privacy very seriously. To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared
        with legal entities within the NMMA who will safeguard it in accordance with this privacy policy. There are also
        times when it may be necessary for NMMA to make certain personal information about you available to companies
        that
        we have a strategic relationship with or that perform work for us to provide products and services to you on our
        behalf. These companies may help us process information, fulfill customer orders, deliver products to you,
        manage
        and enhance customer data, provide customer service, or conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys. These
        companies are also obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy.
        Without
        such information being made available, it would be very difficult to have products delivered to you, receive
        customer service, provide us feedback, or access certain services, offers, and content on the
        DiscoverBoating.com
        website.</p>

        be shared with third parties, including companies and organizations participating in or providing products and

        below).</p>

    <p>Additionally, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith
        belief
        that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process
        served on
        our Web site.</p>

        request form next to the "I would like to be contacted by manufacturers and dealers" label. Your information
        will be
        shared with dealers and manufacturers if you fill out the request for brochures and informational materials from
        manufacturers and dealers while you are using the Boat Selector tool. You may later choose to opt out from these
        emails via Contact Us section of this website.</p>

        physical measures, to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as
        unauthorized
        access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. When you submit sensitive information via the Web site, your

    <h3>Notification of Changes</h3>

    <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage,
        and
        other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it,
        and

        under which the information was collected.</p>

    <p>If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from
        that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or
        not
        we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with
        the
        site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information
        be
        used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not
        affect
        user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users
        of
        the change. In some cases where we post a notice, we will also email users, who have opted to receive
