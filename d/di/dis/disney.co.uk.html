          the best possible use from our sites it may be necessary, in some circumstances, 
          for you to give us personal information about yourself. This policy 
          tells you how we collect information from you, how we protect it and 
          how we use it. We want to help make the Internet a safe and fun experience

          part of the Walt Disney Company group of companies (‘Disney’ for short). 
          It is Disney’s policy that we obey and respect the law in relation to 
          privacy and protect our guests’ personal information from possible misuse. 
          We also allow you access to your personal information so that you can

          or categories of information about you:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first type 
            is information that personally identifies you. For example, your full 
            name (your first name and your surname), your home (or work) address, 
            your e-mail address, telephone number and postcode. We call this ‘personally

          <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other information 
            you give us, by itself, is NOT personally identifiable. For example, 
            whether you are male or female, the times and dates you use are services,<b> 
            </b>the country in which you live, the language you normally speak

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aggregate information 
          allows us to see what ‘types’ of people use our site (for example, how 
          many are girls and how many are boys). From time to time we may also 
          run on-line surveys or questionnaires to collect your thoughts, opinions

          better for you. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may also share

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. When you register 
          for on-line ‘clubs’ that will give you special benefits like exclusive

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This information 
          is then used to inform winners of a competition what prizes they have 
          won, or depending on your age, to inform you of other exciting events 
          happening in the world of Disney. </font></p>

          will ever disclose personal information about you without your prior 
          consent is where we have reason to believe that disclosing this information 
          is necessary to identify, get into contact with or bring legal action 
          against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either 
          intentionally or unintentionally) Disney’s rights or property, or anyone 
          else who could be harmed by those activities. We may disclose memberinformation
