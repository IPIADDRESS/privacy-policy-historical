<br>
dated December 2010</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy (the “Privacy Policy”) tells you how The Walt Disney
Company Limited of 3 Queen Caroline Street, London, England collects
information from you, how we protect it and how we use it, and covers
all personal information which you provide when you use any of our
Disney sites (the “Sites”), unless otherwise specified on the relevant
Site where a different privacy policy will be displayed, and also
controls information provided by you when dealing with any one of
Disney’s promotional partners where you may opt in to receive
information from Disney and agree to your information being forwarded
by that partner to us but do not directly register on a Disney Site.</p>
<p>If we collect information about you as part of another Disney
service on-line (for example, if you order goods from The Disney
Store), then the Disney company that provides that service will also
control that information. We tell you who that company is in the terms
and conditions for that service.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy also covers any other personal information which
you may provide when dealing with the Disney Group of companies or
interacting with any of our Sites (whether or not you are registered),
including data when you make a purchase, register for one of our reward
schemes, book a holiday or register for or use any other Disney
service. We refer to this type of information as transactional data </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how companies within the Disney Group
collect, record and use information about you and the choices you can
make about how the information is collected and used. By using the
Sites or by clicking the “Register” button or other relevant button
during your initial registration with the relevant Site, you signify
your consent that we store and process your personal data in accordance
with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What type of information we collect about you</h2>
<p>We will collect personally identifiable information from you in a
variety of ways including when you register on a Disney Site or use any
other Disney services, enter competitions or prize draws, navigate
around our Sites and respond to communications from us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To register on a Disney Site we require that you submit personal
data, e.g. your name, gender, date of birth, email address and a
password for entry to the Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What we do with personally identifiable information</h2>
<p>This information may be used for marketing (where you have agreed to
this) and for market research purposes, including internal demographic
studies, to provide, optimise and personalise our services, to inform
you if you have won a prize and to send you greetings on your birthday
and to send you newsletters and information (where you have agreed to
this) about other exciting events happening in the world of Disney and
about Disney related products and services. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may use information about you to create a picture of your
interests. This will allow us to understand our customers and visitors
better, so we can make our services and marketing more relevant.
Information that we use in this way may include: (i) information about
your use of this and other Disney Sites; (ii) household classification
data, (iii) your responses to communications from us; (iv) your
interaction with other parts of Disney Group; (v) information you
provide when you register on a Site; (vi) customer surveys; (vii)
information provided by other companies, where you gave them permission
to share this information and (viii) transactional data. We may use a
variety of technical methods such as cookies and web beacons to collate
this information (see the section below on “Use of Cookies” for further
information).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Use of information for marketing</h2>
<p>In line with any permissions you give us, we may send you direct
marketing about our own, or carefully selected third parties’ goods and
services and disclose your information to other organisations who may
send direct marketing to you. You can change your marketing preferences
if you are registered with us. Details on how to do this are set out
below under “Our Registration Policy”. <br></p>
<p>In addition, you can unsubscribe from email communications via
unsubscribe links provided in communications sent to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Who has access to the information at Disney?</h2>
<p>We may share your information with other members of the Disney Group
worldwide. As used in this Privacy Policy the Disney Group includes The
Walt Disney Company Limited and all of its subsidiary and affiliated
entities, including companies such as those branded under Buena Vista,
ABC and ESPN labels that generally do not offer their products and
services under the “Disney” brand name, as well as companies that
generally do offer their products and services under the “Disney” brand
name, such as Disneyland Paris and The Disney Store Ltd. In this
Privacy Policy “we”, “us”, “our” and “ourselves” means any member of
this Group. Wherever your information is processed by the Disney Group,
we will ensure that it is protected appropriately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Who else has access to the information?</h2>
<p>We will only pass on your information to third parties in the
following situations</p>
<p>• if this was clearly stated at the time of collection or
registration and, where required, if you have given permission for this;</p>
<p>• If we employ another organisation to perform tasks on our behalf –
such as delivering goods to you. In this case, the organisations may
only use your information to fulfil this specific task;</p>
<p>• If we sell the business of some of the Disney group of companies
to another organisation or merge with other businesses. In this case,
the buyer will only be able to use your information as set out in this
Privacy Policy;</p>
<p>• If we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is
necessary for legal proceedings. We may also disclose information when
we believe in good faith that applicable law or regulation requires it
or to protect the safety or security of users of our Sites; and</p>
<p>• If we use third party processors to administer and process your
personal information for the purposes notified in the Privacy Policy,
e.g. for hosting activities related to the use of our Sites or
services. We may also share details with third parties (such as
auditors or legal advisors) to obtain advice. Any such processing will
be governed by an agreement in the form required by law, preserving any
statutory data protection rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>International transfer</h2>
<p>As the Disney Group operates globally, it may be necessary to
transfer your information internationally to recipients located outside
the European Union either within the Disney Group or to third party
service providers. Please be assured that we take all reasonable steps
to ensure that your privacy is protected. In this regard, we may
transfer data to Disney Interactive Media Group, The Walt Disney
Company, both in Burbank, California, and to other Disney Group
Entities in the United States. These companies will adhere to this
Privacy Policy and to the "Safe Harbour Principles" officially declared
by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection
as compared to the data protection laws of European Union countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Disney Policies for children</h2>
<p>We encourage parents and guardians to spend time on-line with their
children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on
our Sites. If you are a child (a person who is not of legal age to give
consent to the collection and processing of their data) and want to
register with us, we require permission from a parent or guardian and
you must ask your parent or guardian for permission to register,
confirm you have permission to register and provide an email address
(we may ask for a mobile number if you are registering for a service
through your mobile) for your parent or guardian. We will then send a
message to your parent that you have registered and depending on your
age and location may also ask your parent or guardian to confirm
consent to the registration. We may also carry out checks to verify
that the contact details you have provided are for your parent or
guardian. If you have indicated that you would like to receive
additional Disney material (only available to specified age groups as
indicated when you register or when you subscribe to certain services),
then where required we will also ask your parent for consent. No
information should be submitted to or posted to us without consent of
your parent or guardian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Our registration policy – How to remove or amend your information</h2>
<p>You can ask us to modify or remove your personal information from
any or all of our mailing lists at any time or cancel your registration
by clicking on the “Register” link or any other link we may provide for
you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will use our reasonable endeavours to remove your name from the
related mailing list within 10 working days of your request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<h2>Use of cookies, web beacons, and IP addresses</h2>
<p>Our Sites use a variety of technical methods, including cookies and
web beacons for marketing, research purposes and to enable certain
functions of the site to operate.&nbsp; The information collected from
use of this technology may be collected in a form that identifies you
personally.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also combine your visitor session
information, and other information collected through technical methods,
with personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="font-style: italic;">What are Cookies and Web Beacons?</h2>
<p>Cookies are pieces of information that a Site sends to your computer
or other media device while you are using with the Site. For example,
if you return to one of our Sites after logging in via your computer,
cookies provide information to the Site so that the Site will remember
that you have logged in (we call this “visitor session information”).
You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is
being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on
the pages of Sites. We use web beacons to analyse traffic patterns on
our Sites.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="font-style: italic;">Why?</h2>
<p>We use cookies, web beacons and other technology to enhance your use
of our Sites, with the aim of making our Sites and other content or
services more interesting and useful to you. We are trying to
understand and improve your online experiences by determining what
products, promotions and services we think are likely to be of interest
to you, and by customising the display of banner advertisements and
other messages.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our
guests for a number of purposes including to determine whether our
guests have opened or forwarded those e-mails and/or clicked on links
in those e-mails, to customise the display of the banner advertisements
and other messages after a guest has closed an e-mail, and to determine
whether a guest has made an enquiry or purchase in response to a
particular e-mail.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="font-style: italic;">Who?</h2>
<p>Cookies, web beacons and other technical methods may involve the
transmission of information either directly to us or to another party
authorised by us to collect information on our behalf. Also, you may
get cookies (including “Flash cookies”) from our advertisers and
sponsors. We do not control these cookies, and once you have clicked on
the advertisement and left our Sites our Privacy Policy no longer
applies.
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="font-style: italic;">Controlling Cookies</h2>
<p>Using the settings of your internet browser software, such as
Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari, you can control how
cookies are put on your computer or media device. Each browser is a
little different, so please look at your browser’s Help to learn the
correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won’t
have access to many features that make your interaction with our Sites
smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services
will not function properly.
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="font-style: italic;">Use of Your IP Address</h2>
<p>By using one of our Sites, you agree that we may collect your IP
address or other unique identifier. At times, we use these identifiers
to collect information regarding how often our guests visit various
parts of our Sites. We may combine your IP address with other
personally identifiable information for marketing (where you have opted
in to receive it) and for market research purposes, including internal
demographic studies, so we can optimize our products and services and
customize the Sites for you.
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="font-style: italic;">“Flash Cookies”</h2>
<p>We may use local shared objects, also known as “Flash cookies”, to
store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on
our site to personalize your visit. Flash cookies are different from
browser cookies because of the amount of data, type of data , and how
data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will
not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage
settings for Flash cookies  <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">click here.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<h2>Links to other sites</h2>
<p>You should be aware that when you are on our Sites you could be
directed to other sites where the personal information collected is
outside of our control.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if you click on a banner advertisement or a Disney
search result the click may take you to a third party site. The privacy
policy of the new site will govern the information obtained from you on
that site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time and we will post
the latest version on this and all our other Sites. If we ever wish to
use your personal information in a way which is incompatible with the
information in this Privacy Policy, we will only do so with your
consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Queries</h2>
<p>If you have queries about our use of your personal information or
wish to have your personal information removed, you can email <a href="mailto:help@disney.co.uk">help@disney.co.uk</a> or write to us
