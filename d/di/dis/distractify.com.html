<li><b>Cookies information:</b> When you visit the Services, we may send one or more cookies to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Distractify help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Sites. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Services (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Services), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Services over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Sites. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browserâs directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</li>
<li><b>Log file information:</b> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use our Services, our servers (whether operated by us or a third party provider) automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (âIPâ) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Services, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</li>
<li><b>Clear gifs/web beacons information:</b> When you use the Services, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our Users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Services.</li>
<li><b>Device identifiers:</b> When you access the Services by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more âdevice identifiers,â such as a unique device identifier (âUDIDâ). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the deviceâs operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Distractify. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Services. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Services. Some features of the Services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</li>
<li><b>Location data:</b> When you access the Services by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store âlocation data,â which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Services. Some features of the Services, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.</li>
<li><b>Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information we collect:</b> We use or may use cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Services; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; (g) to provide advertising to your browser or device, and (h) automatically update the Distractify application on your mobile devices.</li></ul>
<p>II. Sharing of Your Information</p>
<ul><li><b>Personally Identifiable Information:</b> We will not rent or sell your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties outside Distractify and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent, except as noted below:</li>
<li><b>Who we may share your Personally Identifiable Information with:</b> We respect your privacy and encourage sharing of Personally Identifiable Information on an opt-in, case-by-case basis. We may offer sponsored content or prompts on behalf of clearly identified third parties ("Sponsors"). If you elect (opt-in) to provide your information in response to content or a prompt, then we may share or sell your Personally Identifiable Information, either alone or together with Services usage and analytics information, with the Sponsor identified and/or any intermediary acting on behalf of that Sponsor. Opting-in for one Sponsor does not mean weâll share your information with other Sponsors. We may also share your Personally Identifiable Information with third-party providers for the purpose of providing the Services to you (i.e. email providers, server providers, etc.).</li>
<li><b>Who you may choose to share your User Content with:</b> If you elect to post something in a public area of our Services (for example, by recommending, sharing, or liking a post), any Personally Identifiable Information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Services, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings. If you remove information that you posted to the Services, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Services, or if other Users have copied or saved that information.</li>
<li><b>What happens in the event of a change of control:</b> We may buy or sell/divest the company, or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses. Personally Identifiable Information such as customer names and email addresses, User Content and other User information related to the Services will likely be among the items transferred in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions or similar transactions or proceedings, provided that the recipient of such information will continue to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li><b>Instances where we are required to share your Personally Identifiable Information:</b> Distractify will disclose Personally Identifiable Information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms of Service at <a href="http://www.distractify.com/terms" rel="nofollow">http://www.distractify.com/terms</a> or to protect the security or integrity of our Services; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Distractify, our Users or others.</li>
<li><b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</b> We may share Non-Personally Identifiable Information, including information obtained through tools such as cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.): (i) in any manner permitted for Personally Identifiable Information; and (ii) with our third-party business partners for the purposes described in the section above on âHow We Collect and Use Information.â We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties.</li>
<li><b>Ads on Distractify:</b> We may also share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with our business partners to deliver online advertisements (âadsâ) that may be of interest to you. Distractify may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Services. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the Services, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, web beacons, JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browserâs or deviceâs visits and usage patterns on the Services (without using any Personally Identifiable Information), and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content. Distractify does not have access to or control over cookies, web beacons or other technologies that third parties may use. Distractify does not sell, rent, or share your Personally Identifiable Information with these third-party ad servers or ad networks for such partiesâ own marketing purposes, unless you choose in advance to have your information shared for this purpose. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Distractify to show an ad to a certain audience and you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. Distractifyâs Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information. Some of these advertising companies may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (âNAIâ), a cooperative of online marketing companies that offers a centralized tool for opting out of behavioral advertising delivered by each of its member companies. If you would like to obtain more information about the NAI and make choices about their use of your information, please CLICK HERE.</li>
<li>We may use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. In connection with this advertising, we, along with third-party business partners, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) to allow our third-party business partners, including Google, ad servers, and ad networks, to serve you advertisements (âadsâ) based on your prior visits to our Services. These ads are delivered to you on third-party websites and services across the Internet. These third-party business partners use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on third-party sites, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. Along with cookies, they may also use other technologies (such as JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browserâs or deviceâs visits and usage patterns on the Services, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to optimize and personalize the advertising content. Distractify does not sell, rent, or share the information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with these third-party business partners for such partiesâ own marketing purposes. You may opt out of the DoubleClick cookie by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page or you may opt out of Google Analytics by visiting the Google Analytics opt-out page found at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/. Google has additional information available about their Remarketing Privacy Guidelines, Policies, and Restrictions.</li></ul>

<p>VII. Other Web Sites and Services</p>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or services linked to or from the Services, including the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Services to another website, our Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have a link on our website, are subject to that third partyâs own rules and policies. In addition, you agree that we are not responsible and we do not control over any third-parties that you authorize to access your User Content. If you are using a third-party website or service (like Facebook) and you allow such a third-party access to you User Content you do so at your own risk. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources other than through the Services.</p>
<p>VIII. Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</p>
<p>Distractify may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements on the Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.</p>
<p>Distractify does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Distractify to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.</p>
<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. Distractify's Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</p>
