          <h1>Disconnect privacy policy</h1>
          <p>This policy effective June 22, 2018</p>
          <p>
            We’re committed to protecting your privacy and collecting only the minimum amount of info needed to provide our software and services — referred to as “Services”. Your use of the Services indicates you agree to this policy and <a href="/terms">our terms of use</a>.
          </p>
          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <div class="summary-new">
            <p>Nothing in this policy contradicts the following statements:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                We don’t collect any of your personal info, including your IP address, other than information you voluntarily provide.
              </li>
              <li>
                We don’t sell your personal info to advertisers or other third parties.
              </li>
              <li>We share your personal info only when legally required, or when reasonably necessary to prevent harm in an emergency situation.</li>
              <li>
                We retain your personal info, excluding info you make public, for no more than 30 days after you request deletion.
              </li>
              <li>
                We have never received any legal or government demands for user information.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <h2>Complete terms</h2>
          <p>
            As used in this policy, “Personal Info” is data that can identify a particular person. Aggregate data isn’t considered Personal Info.
          </p>
          <h3>
            1. Disconnect never collects your Personal Info except to communicate with you
          </h3>
          <p>
            Our Services don't collect any of your Personal Info. Unlike most websites, our site doesn’t collect your IP address. We do detect non-personally identifiable geo-location information to optimize our services, but we definitely don't collect your precise geo-location or associate geo-location information with a particular user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because we do not collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services, there is no need for us to respond to a browser’s Do Not Track settings, although we strongly support a consumer’s right to set such a preference and encourage all website operators to honor this consumer choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may request your email address or a username to communicate with you. This info is used only as you’d expect and deleted upon request.
          </p>
          <p>
            Optionally, you may choose to provide your email address and communicate with us via email.
          </p>
          <p>We use Stripe and PayPal to process payments. You can optionally provide your email for a receipt. Your payment information and email is subject to their respective privacy policies. <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">https://stripe.com/privacy</a> and <a href="https://paypal.com/privacy">https://paypal.com/privacy</a></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            To improve the Services and your experience on our site, we may collect aggregate usage data from the Services and our website, including number of page views, visitor browser types, operating systems, or the links clicked to navigate to and from our site. We use a non-identifying first-party browser cookie to remember your search preferences (language, country, search engine) for our search service at <a href="https://search.disconnect.me">https://search.disconnect.me</a>. Our cookies don’t track you. Most browsers allow you to refuse cookies or disable them, you can find out more <a href="http://www.civicuk.com/cookie-control/browser-settings">here</a>. Or check your browser preferences.
          </p>
          <h3>
            2. Disconnect never sells your email address or any other Personal Info you volunteer
          </h3>
          <p>
            We don’t receive payment in cash or in kind from third parties in exchange for your Personal Info. Further, we don’t allow third parties to collect info about you on our site through cookies or other means.
          </p>
          <h3>
            3. Disconnect shares your Personal Info only in specific circumstances
          </h3>
          <p>
            There are a few, rare circumstances when we may have to share your Personal Info either to obey the law or protect our rights. We’ll share your Personal Info only to comply with laws or legally enforceable requests, to enforce our own rights and contracts with users or third parties, or to prevent harm to others and their property in an emergency situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In all instances, we’ll share the minimum info necessary to meet the immediate need and inform you of our disclosure when legally and practically possible.
          </p>
          <h3>
            4. Disconnect retains the Personal Info you volunteer for one month or less
          </h3>
          <p>
            We remove your Personal Info from our records within 30 days of any request to do so.
          </p>
          <h3>
            5. Transparency report
          </h3>
          <p>
            As explained above, we will comply with a request for user data when the law requires it, but we require valid legal process to compel the disclosure of user data to the government; such as a legitimate and properly scoped court order, or a search warrant supported by probable cause and issued by an appropriate law enforcement authority. We interpret requests narrowly, and we will oppose unlawful or overbroad requests for specific user data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recipients of&nbsp;National Security Requests can only publish reporting bands instead of specific figures. If we receive such a request, we may challenge these reporting bands, in addition to opposing any unlawful or overbroad requests.
          </p>
          <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may make small, inconsequential changes to this policy with or without notice to you, so you’re encouraged to review the policy from time to time. Substantive changes to this policy will be emailed to users who submit a request to <a href="mailto:support@disconnect.me">support@disconnect.me</a>.
          </p>
