IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SITE OR PROVIDE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US.</strong></p><h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2><p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p><p>DiscountPandit reserves the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.

Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific End User. When you engage in certain activities on the Website, such as creating an account, ordering a product or service from us or our partners, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums, entering a contest, filling out a survey, posting a review, sending us or our partners feedback, requesting information about our services, submitting an affiliate agreement), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address and telephone number. When you order products or services, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.</p><p>Information collected under Referral Program If you choose to use our referral service or buy a deal for a friend, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email with the gift you bought for them or inviting him or her to visit the site. DiscountPandit stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, sending their gift, and tracking the success of our referral program.</p><p>Your friend may contact us at info@discountpandit.com<script cf-hash="f9e31" type="text/javascript">

We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide products and services to you, administer contests, enhance the operation of the Website, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website use, improve our product and service offerings, and to tailor your experience with third parties as provided in Item 3 of this Privacy Policy. For example, if you send our customer service an email we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about our services, and may post your comment in our marketing materials or on our Website. Your comments may contain personal information such as your name, we will obtain consent from you to post your name along with your comment prior to posting your comment for public view. In addition, if you use our Website to send information or a product to another person, we may store your personal information. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.</p><h2>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h2><p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific End User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are using and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described in Items 4 and 8 of this Privacy Policy.</p><p>We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.</p><h2>Sharing of Information</h2><p>We will not share, sell, rent, or trade your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as provided below:</p><p> We may share your information with DiscountPandit Merchants. From time to time, we provide offers from particular merchants who, as part of the offer, request information on DiscountPandit customers who purchased the offer in order to aid redemption. In those cases, we share some of your Personally Identifiable Information. Sharing this information may allow a DiscountPandit merchant to market directly to you should they choose to do so. However, we will only share Personally Identifiable Information with a DiscountPandit merchant if you engage in an Identification Activity, and then only to the DiscountPandit merchant involved in that Identification Activity. We specifically disclaim any responsibility or liability for the actions of such DiscountPandit Merchant. While we inform them that they are only permitted to communicate with you for the purposes of the specific promotion with DiscountPandit, we do not have any responsibility for the actions of the DiscountPandit, and the actions of the DiscountPandit merchant are not in our control.</p><p>We may share your information with Authorized Third Party Service Providers. We provide services and products through third parties. These “Third Party Service Providers” perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing our administrative and promotional emails. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, deliver packages, send postal or email, administer contests or sweepstakes, remove repetitive information on customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, process credit card payments, operate the Website, troubleshoot, and provide customer service. We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies (“Affiliates”) with whom we have business relationships and may share your information with Service Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. For example, when you order a service, we release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for the service and, if applicable, release your address to the delivery service to deliver the service. Likewise, we may release an Affiliate’s information to our bank to send out a payment. We encourage DiscountPandit merchants and Third Party Service Providers to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.</p><p>We may remarket your information.

As with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.</p><p>We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection of Others. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Website Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of the Website, its Users or others.</p><p>We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Partners, Affiliates and Advertisers.

These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide, through the use of network tags, advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.</p><p>We also use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our Users to administer our Website and constantly improve its quality.

You can access your Personally Identifiable Information on our Website through a password and your email address. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone.

To facilitate and customize your experience with the Website, we store cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a User’s computer for record-keeping purposes which contains information about that User. We use cookies to save you time while using the Website, remind us who you are, and track and target User interests in order to provide a customized experience. Cookies also allow us to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from you, like which pages you visited and what links you clicked on. Use of this information helps us to create a more user-friendly experience for all visitors. In addition, we may use Third Party Advertising Companies to display advertisements on our Website. As part of their service, they may place separate cookies on your computer. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by our Website only and does not cover the use of cookies by any Advertiser. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser settings to decline cookies. Please note that if you decline or delete these cookies, some parts of the Website may not work properly.</p><p>Other Tracking Devices. We may use other industry standard technologies to track your use of our Website pages and promotions, or we may allow our Third Party Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf. These technologies allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Website, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also use some of the technology provided by our Affiliates and/or Marketing Partners for the same purposes.</p><h2>Privacy Policies of Third Party Website</h2><p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information only for DiscountPandit deals. Other websites that may be accessible through this Website have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. If you link to any such website, we urge you to review the website’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.</p><h2>Other Privacy Issues</h2><p>Children: Minors under the age of 18 may not use the Website.

DiscountPandit does not sell products for purchase by children. In certain instances, we sell children's products for purchase by adults.</p><p>Public Areas: We may provide areas on our Website where you can publicly post information about yourself, can communicate with others such as discussion boards or blogs, or can review products, restaurants, and submit media content. This information may be accessible by other consumers and companies and may appear on other websites or web searches, and therefore this information could be read, collected, and used by others. For example, if you post your email address along with a public restaurant review, you may receive unsolicited messages. We have no control over who reads your postings or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so please use caution when posting any personal information. We do obtain consent from our users to post their name along with their reviews.</p><p>Social Media Connect. DiscountPandit allows users to connect through Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn to interact with friends and to share deals on them. DiscountPandit also has the provision of logging in through these sites. Eg: If you are logged into DiscountPandit and Facebook, when you click on "Connect with Facebook" your profiles will merge if the email addresses match. If the email addresses don't match, we ask you if you want to merge them and you must enter your DiscountPandit password to validate that they control that account. If you are already logged into DiscountPandit but not logged into Facebook, when you click on "Connect with Facebook" you will be prompted to enter your Facebook credentials or to "Sign up for Facebook." By proceeding you are allowing the DiscountPandit site to access your information and you are agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use in your use of DiscountPandit sites.</p><p>Conversely, if you are not currently registered as a DiscountPandit user and you click on "Sign in Using Facebook," you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join DiscountPandit. Once you register on the DiscountPandit site and Connect with Facebook, you will be able to automatically post recent activity back to Facebook.
