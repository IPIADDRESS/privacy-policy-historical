<p>Outside Sources and Web Sites</p>
<p>Disclose.tv contains hyperlinks to other web sites. Disclose.tv is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites and companies.</p>
<p>Disclose.tv may have entered into partnership and affiliation agreements with other web sites and companies. We may share aggregate information with our partners and affiliates as disclosed above. We may also transfer visitors to these web sites to provide certain features. Disclose.tv is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these partners and affiliates web sites.</p>
<p>Beware that some of these partners and affiliates may utilize a design that incorporates and utilizes a virtually identical copy of Disclose.tv’s graphics and layout so it may appear that you are still on Disclose.tv web site if you didn’t notice the different domain name in the browser’s address bar. These partners and affiliates may collect information from you. Before collecting personally identifying information from you our partners and affiliates’ web sites that utilize this design will disclose that you are no longer on<br>
Disclose.tv and that the web site is not subject to Disclose.tv’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>We may use outside companies to display advertisements on Disclose.tv. These ads may contain cookies and/or web beacons to collect data in the ad serving process. Some of these ads maybe loaded off of these companies’ servers. While we use cookies in other parts of Disclose.tv, cookies and/or web beacons received with banner ads are collected by our ad companies, and we do not have access to this information.</p>
<p>Third-party Advertising Disclosures.</p>
<p>Disclose.tv uses third-party advertising companies to serve some ads when you visit Disclose.tv. These companies may use information about your visits to Disclose.tv and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Additionally, Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve some ads on Disclose.tv. Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to Disclose.tv users based on their visit to Disclose.tv and other sites on the Internet.</p>
<p>Furthermore Disclose.tv is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to [Disclose.tv shop (amazon.com, endless.com, smallparts.com or myhabit.com)].</p>
<p>Certain Exceptional Disclosures and Compelled Disclosure</p>
<p>We may disclose your information if necessary to protect our legal rights or if we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address, or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.</p>
<p>What Are Cookies? Why Do We Use Them?</p>
<p>Cookies are small files stored by your browser in your computer when you visit Disclose.tv. We use cookies to improve Disclose.tv and make it easier to use. Cookies permit us to recognize users and avoid repetitive requests for the same information. We mostly use “session cookies” that are automatically deleted after each visit. Cookies from Disclose.tv can’t be read by other web sites. Most browsers will accept cookies until you change browser settings to refuse them.</p>
<p>How Do We Protect Information We Collect?</p>
<p>We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by Disclose.tv reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.</p>
<p>How Long Do We Keep User Information?</p>
<p>We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely.</p>
<p>Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control. Note: we have greater control over recently collected data than for archived data. Once data is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests. In those cases, our general data retention policy applies.</p>
<p>Your Consent To This Policy</p>
<p>By using Disclose.tv, you agree to this Policy. Our Site Terms take precedence over any conflicting Policy provision.</p>
<p>Legal Disclaimer</p>
<p>Disclose.tv operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind. We are not responsible for events beyond our direct control. This Policy is governed by German law, excluding conflicts of law principles. Any legal actions against us must be commenced in Passau, Germany within one year after the claim arose, or be barred.</p>
