You may see certain ads on our Sites and Services because we participate in advertising networks. Some ad networks allow us and other advertisers to target advertising to users through demographic, behavioral and contextual means. These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means when you visit our Sites and Services and third party sites, applications and services, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other methods.  Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows them to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. We do not have access to or control over the cookies that may be placed by these parties on your computer, and have no control over these parties' privacy policies or information collection practices. 
</p><p>
The information our ad network vendors collect includes information about your use of our mobile applications and visits to websites that participate in the advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you have viewed, the location of your mobile device and the actions you take on the websites and mobile applications. The networks use this information to show you targeted advertisements on our Sites and Services, and on third party sites, applications and services, that they believe will be of most interest to you. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

When you choose to participate in a third party application, social media site, feature or service offered within the Sites and Services (for example Facebook Connect, integrated Facebook comments or Twitter website widgets), you may be opting to link or share your activity on Sites and Services with that third party application, social media site, feature or service, which may then collect information about you and may publish that activity to your "profile," "timeline," "feedback" or similar feature with that third party.  For example, if you choose to "like" or "share" content through our Sites and Services when a third party application, social media site, feature or service is enabled, or to otherwise post information from or via our Sites and Services to a third party application, social media site, feature or service, that information may be publicly displayed or displayed to your friends or followers and the third party may have access to information about you and your use of our Sites and Services. 
You may be able to disable ongoing sharing of information with us from third party applications, social media site and features.  To do so visit the applicable section of the application, site or feature and adjust your privacy and sharing settings, or otherwise disassociate the application, site or feature from our Sites and Services.

When California customers provide personal information to a business, they have the right to request certain disclosures if that business shares personal information with our affiliates or third parties for the third parties' or our affiliates' direct marketing purposes. Once per calendar year the customer may request that the business provide a list of companies with which it shares personal information for the third parties' or our affiliates' direct marketing purposes, and a list of the categories of personal information that the business shares. Instead of responding to such requests, however, a company may choose to comply with this law by establishing and publishing on its website a policy of not disclosing a customer's personal information to such third parties or our affiliates unless the customer affirmatively agrees to such disclosures, or a policy of not disclosing a customer's personal information to such third parties or our affiliates if the customer has exercised an option that prevents that information from being disclosed to third parties or our affiliates for those purposes. Thus, a company may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.  As noted in the "Your Choices" section above, you may opt-out of our sharing of your personal information with third parties or our affiliates for their own direct marketing purposes. 
</p><p> 
California customers may request information about our compliance with this law by sending an email to privacy@utsandiego.com. Any such inquiry must include "California Privacy Rights Request" in the first line of the description. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email address.
</p><p></p><p><a name="accesscorrect"></a></p><h3><a name="accesscorrect">Access and Correction</a></h3><p>
You may access certain personal information we maintain about you, or update or correct inaccuracies in that information, using the online account "profile" or "preferences" feature of our Sites and Services (if applicable). In addition, if you believe other personal information we maintain about you is inaccurate, you may request that we correct or amend the information by contacting us as indicated in the "How to Contact Us" section of this Privacy Policy. If we deny an access request, we will notify you of the reasons for the denial.

Our Sites and Services may contain links to other sites and services for your convenience and information and for advertising purposes. Linked sites may have their own privacy notices, which you should review if you visit those sites.

When you visit or use our Sites and Services, visit linked sites, click on advertisements displayed in our Sites and Services, receive or participate in a service with a third party, or choose to share your information with third parties (including reward program providers and third party social media sites like Facebook and Twitter), your information may be collected and used by third parties and accessible by users of third party sites.  The information collected by the third party is subject to the third party's privacy and other practices, policies, and agreements, including whether the third party continues to share information with us or with other third parties, the types of information shared and your choices with regard to the collection, use and disclosure of the information. We are not responsible for any use of those sites or services or the privacy practices of the third parties that operate those sites or provide those services.
</p><p></p><p><a name="endeavor"></a></p><h3><a name="endeavor">How We Endeavor to Protect Personal Information</a></h3><p>
We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to assist us in protecting the personal information we collect against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.  When you provide your credit or debit card information as payment for a transaction, the payment card information is encrypted while in transit to the payment processor that processes your transaction. Please note that no data storage or electronic transmission of information can be entirely secure. We cannot guarantee that the security measures we have in place to safeguard personal information will never be defeated or fail or that those measures will always be sufficient or effective.
</p><p>

The "Effective Date" at the top of this Privacy Policy indicates when it was most recently updated.
