            <font size="3">The privacy of visitors to diseno-art.com is very important 
            to us. At diseno-art.com, we recognize that privacy of your personal 
            information is important. Here is information on what types of personal 
            information we receive and collect when you use and visit this site, 
            and how we safeguard your information. We never under any circumstance 
            supply this information to third parties. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <font size="4">Log Files</font><br>
            As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained 
            in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet 
            protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider), the browser 
            you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), 
            the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout 
            our site. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <font size="4">Cookies and Web Beacons</font><br>
            On diseno-art.com third party advertisements are used to support our 
            site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies 
            and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send 
            these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) 
            information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you 
            used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash 
            installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing 
            relevant advertisements depending on your location) or showing certain 
            ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing gadget advertisments 
            to someone who frequents gadget websites). <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <font size="4">DoubleClick DART cookies</font><br>
            We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Googleâ€™s DoubleClick, 
            which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web 
            and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google 
            AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific 
            to you and your interests. The ads served will be targeted based on 
            your previous browsing history. DART uses "non personally identifiable 
            information". It does NOT track personal information about you, 
            such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, 
            social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers.<br>
            <br>
            You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party 
            cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs 
            such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you 
            are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This 
            could include the inability to login to services or programs, such 
            as logging into forums or accounts. <br>
            <br>
            Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any 
            advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, 
            the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie 
            will be added. <br>
