        POLICY </b></font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The policies below 
        are applicable to <a href="http://www.disneychannel-asia.com" target="_blank">www.disneychannel-asia.com</a> 
        web site owned and operated by Disney Online. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Disney Online collects 
        personally identifying information only during contest or sweepstakes 
        registration and in certain portions of sites in which guests provide 
        content submissions and suggestions or participate in interactive online 
        activities (i.e., community postings, voting, chat, games, or bulletin 
        boards). Disney Online may use such information to fulfill prizes or for 
        editorial and feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when 
        guests provide the information). In the event Disney Online plans to post 
        any such information on a site, guests are provided prior notification 
        of such posting and given the option of preventing such posting. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Policies for Individuals 
        Under 13 </u></font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Disney Online encourages 
        parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to 
        participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites. No information 
        should be submitted to or posted at Disney Online's Web sites by guests 
        under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. 
        Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, Disney Online does not provide 
        any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any 
        third party for any purpose whatsoever. Although guests under 13 years 
        of age are allowed to participate in contests, if such a guest wins, notification 
        and prizes are sent to the parents or guardians identified in the initial 
        Registration process. No information collected from guests under 13 years 
        of age is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either 
        inside or outside Disney. Guests' e-mail addresses are never posted on 
        Disney Online Web sites. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Policies for Individuals 
        13 Years of Age or Older</u></font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> With the permission 
        of a guest who is 13 years of age or over, information submitted at the 
        time of sweeps registration or any form of submission may be used for 
        marketing and promotional purposes by Disney. If a guest objects to such 
        use for any reason, he/she may stop that use by e-mail request. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>About IP Addresses 
        </u></font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Disney Online collects 
        IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate 
        information to our advertisers. An IP address is a number that's automatically 
        assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers 
        -- the big computers that "serve" up Web pages -- automatically identify 
        your computer by its IP address. When guests request pages from Disney 
        Online sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not link 
        IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's 
        session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Use of Cookies 
        -- The Disney Online Cookies Policy</u></font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What are cookies? 
        Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's 
        hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier 
        for you by saving your passwords and preferences while you're at our site. 
        The use of cookies is an Industry standard -- you'll find them at most 
        major Web sites. By showing how and when guests use the site, cookies 
        help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements 
        and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors 
        and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. 
        If you accept the first tracking cookie from <a href="http://www.disneychannel-asia.com" target="_blank">disneychannel-asia.com</a>, 
        you won't be offered as many afterwards.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>How Disney Online 
        Sites Do Not Use Cookies</u></font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Disney Online Sites 
        never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was 
        not originally sent in a cookie. Except as described below, Disney Online 
        Sites do not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional 
        or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties 
        whatsoever. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Disney Online Sites 
        do not use cookies to identify specific individuals, except in such cases 
        as online shopping (see above) and contest registration (where a cookie 
        allows you to enter a contest every day without registering again each 
        time).</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Most browsers are 
        initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to 
        refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it 
        is possible that some parts of the site, such as the shopping, contest, 
        and game areas, will not function properly if you do so. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Links to Other 
        Sites </u></font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Users should be aware 
        that when you are on Disney Online sites you could be directed to other 
        sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from 
        Disney Online sites that take you outside our service. These other sites 
        may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal 
        information. Always be aware of where you end up. Please keep in mind 
        that whenever you give out personal information online - for example, 
        via message boards or chat - that information can be collected and used 
        by people you don't know. While Disney Online strives to protect its user's 
        personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of 
        any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Your Acceptance 
        of These Terms </u></font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By using this site, 
        you signify your assent to the Disney Online Privacy Policy. If you do 
        not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued 
        use of the Disney Online sites following the posting of changes to these 
        terms will mean you accept those changes.</font></p>
