			<p>On a limited number of our Web pages, we employ 
"cookies" to provide better service to our customers. We do not use 
cookies to collect any personal, identifying information from users or 
to track user activities beyond our website. We do not maintain copies 
of cookies on our website after you leave our website.</p>
			<p>Cookies are small pieces of temporary data that 
are exchanged between a website and a user's computer which enable a 
"session", or "dialog", to be established between the two machines. With
 the session established, we are able to tailor responses (i.e., 
identify and provide you with the information you want) and help you 
traverse our web pages in the most efficient and effective manner 
possible. The session ends when we do not receive further requests from 
your computer or you simply exit your browser.</p>
			<p>We limit our use of cookies to "session 
cookies"; types of cookies that are temporarily stored in your 
computer's memory. Session cookies are normally deleted from your 
computer when you log off the computer or you exit the browser. Benefits.gov does not issue "persistent cookies," which are cookies that could be stored permanently on your workstation and reused each time you visit the Benefits.gov website. Some social media and third party sites that display information from Benefits.gov may use persistent cookie technology. Most Internet browsers automatically accept persistent cookies. Although using persistent cookies may create a better experience for you, these sites should also work without them. If you don't want to accept cookies, you can edit your browser's options to stop accepting persistent cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.</p>
