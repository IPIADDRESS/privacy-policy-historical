You will be notified at the time your Personal Information is requested and collected during your participation as to which entity is collecting the Personal Information.

<div style="margin-bottom: 12pt" align="left">Advertisements appearing on our Site may be delivered to users and Members by a third party advertiser. Such third party advertisers may use cookies that allow the advertiser’s server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, the third party advertiser’s servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked on. This information allows a third party advertiser to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.&nbsp;Please note that this Privacy Policy only covers the use of cookies by us on our Site and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers or third parties, even if an advertisement appears on our Site.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 12pt" align="left">Links. Our Site may provide links to other Web sites or resources.&nbsp;These links are for your convenience only and are not under our control.&nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that Disaboom is not responsible for such external Web sites or resources, and neither Disaboom nor our Site endorses any such Web site, its use or contents and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such Web sites or resources.&nbsp;You agree that neither Disaboom nor our Site shall be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage, viruses or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with your use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on such external Web sites or resources.&nbsp;In the event you decide to access or use any of these other Web sites or resources, you agree you do so at your own risk.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 12pt" align="left">Safety Tips. Our Site makes it easy to express yourself, connect with friends and make new ones, but please remember that what you post could embarrass you or expose you to danger. Here are some common sense guidelines that you should follow when using our Site and the Public Areas on our Site:</div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in; line-height: 12pt" align="left"><span>§&nbsp;</span>Don't forget that your profile and the Site's forums are public spaces. Don't provide Member Content to others or post anything you wouldn't want the world to know (e.g., your phone number, address, IM screen name, or specific whereabouts). Avoid posting anything that would make it easy for a stranger (or anyone else you may not want) to find you.</div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in; line-height: 12pt" align="left"><span>§&nbsp;</span>If you feel someone's behavior is inappropriate, illegal or offensive, react.&nbsp;Report it to our Site or the authorities.</div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in; line-height: 12pt" align="left"><span>§&nbsp;</span>Don't mislead people into thinking that you're older or younger or are someone you are not.</div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in; line-height: 12pt" align="left"><span>§&nbsp;</span>Don't get hooked by a phishing scam. Phishing is a method commonly used by criminals to obtain personal information, such as your username and password, by pretending to be a Web site or a company that you trust.</div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in; line-height: 12pt" align="left"><span>§&nbsp;</span>If you want to buy or sell something through Disaboom Classified Ads do not give out or post any personal information that you do not want the public or a stranger to know. In order to avoid fraud you should only buy and sell in your local area, choose a public place to meet to exchange the goods, and pay or request payment in cash. Do not accept cashier’s checks or personal checks. Do not agree to wire your money.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 12pt" align="left">You agree that neither Disaboom nor our Site shall be responsible or liable, either directly or indirectly, for Member Content you provide or make available or any thing you post or of the consequences of your actions. In the event you decide to reveal information about yourself or others that may expose you to danger or any harm you do so at your own risk.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 12pt" align="left">Marketing &amp; Contact Preferences/Opt-out /Updating or Removing Information. At various points during the Member registration process, you may be asked to indicate your willingness to allow us to communicate with you, share Personal Information collected online with third parties that are not related to our Site, or receive updates or notifications regarding the Site. We will honor your preferences, except as necessary to communicate with you regarding our Terms of Use, including this Privacy Policy, transactions or your Member profile, Member Content, postings or for customer service purposes (e.g., in response to your inquiries). At any time, however, you may (a) stop the receipt of a promotional email by clicking on an "unsubscribe" hyperlink contained in any promotional emails we send you, (b) change your email preferences, (c) remove yourself from our email promotional mailing list, or (d) opt out of further disclosures of your Personal Information to third parties, in each case by contacting us at: 7730 E Bellview Ave #A306 Greenwood Village, CO 80111 or by e-mailing us at info@disaboom.com. Please allow Disaboom a reasonable time to modify your preferences.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 12pt" align="left">Members may also modify certain of their preferences and modify/edit their personal information by logging in to MyDisaboom page of their account and modifying the fields in the Edit Bio section.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 12pt" align="left">Security. We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information and while no data transmission which is wireless or mobile or over the Internet is completely secure, we have and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your Personal Information. Unfortunately, no Internet transaction is 100% secure, but we attempt to take reasonable measures to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. However, the Site cannot insure or warrant the security of that information.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 12pt" align="left">Member accounts on our Site are secured by Member-created passwords.&nbsp;Our Site takes precautions to insure that Member account information is kept private. We restrict access to Member information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff.</div>
<div style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 12pt" align="left">SSL, an industry standard, is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us.&nbsp;Since any information you provide to us on the Site will be transmitted using a secure connection, if your Web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to make a purchase on our Site.&nbsp;The most recent versions of Netscape Navigator™ and Microsoft Internet Explorer® can support a secure connection and can be downloaded for free from the Netscape and Microsoft website respectively.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 12pt" align="left">Sharing and Disclosure of Information our Site Collects. We have the rights to use any information you voluntarily submit to us. Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose Personal Information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant, request from law enforcement or other legal process received by our Site, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce our Site’s Terms of Use or to protect our rights; (3) to protect the safety of the public, our personnel, users of the Site, Members and/or others; and/or (4) as disclosed or notified to you, whether in our Terms of Use, including, this Privacy Policy, or otherwise on or in connection with your use of our Site.</div>
