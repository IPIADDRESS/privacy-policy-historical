<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="3"><b>We Respect 
  Your Privacy</b></font></p>

<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">Our mission 
  is to provide you with superior products and services, along with the peace 
  of mind knowing that your privacy is secure. We understand your concerns about 
  guarding information about you and your Account. We want to assure you that 
  we have taken steps, and will continue to take steps, to safeguard that information.
	</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">This Privacy 
  Policy describes our efforts to meet these objectives. It includes a summary 
  of the personal information we collect, when it may be shared with others, how 
  we safeguard the confidentiality and security of information, and the steps 
  that you may take to limit our sharing of such information with others. Please 
  read it carefully. We hope our Privacy Policy will help you understand how we 
  collect and share information. </font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2"><b>1. What 
  Personal Information Do We Collect?</b></font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">To serve you 
  better and manage our business, it is important that we collect and maintain 
  accurate personal information about you. We obtain this information from applications 
  and other forms you submit to us, from your dealings with us and others, from 
  consumer reporting agencies, and from other sources, such as our Web sites. 
  For example:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">We may 
      obtain information such as your name, address and date of birth from applications 
      and other forms you submit to us.</font> </div>
  </li> 
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">We may 
      obtain information such as Account balances, payment history, your use of 
      your Account and the types of services you prefer from your transactions 
      and other dealings with us and others.</font>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">We may obtain information 
    such as the balances of your loans with other lenders and your payment history 
    with others from consumer reporting agencies.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">We may obtain information 
    such as your Internet service provider, your domain name, your computer's 
    operating system and Web browser, your Web site use and your product and service 
    preferences from your visits to our Web sites.</font></li>
</ul>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2"><b>2. Is 
  Personal Information Shared with Others?</b></font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">We limit the 
  sharing of information with others. Many of the offers you receive for products 
  and services are provided directly to you from us. For example, a retailer that 
  accepts the Discover® Card may come to us with a special offer for Cardmembers, 
  such as a discount certificate or product upgrade. After careful consideration 
  of the nature of the offer and the company, we will create a list of Cardmembers 
  who may be interested in the offer based on certain characteristics. We will 
  send the offer directly to those Cardmembers on behalf of the retailer by, for 
  example, an insert in their monthly billing statement or mailing the offer ourselves. 
  We control the information used to make the offer; we do not share the list 
  or any information about our Cardmembers with the retailer. However, please
  understand that if you do receive this type of offer from us and choose to take
  advantage of it, the retailer may then learn information about you because only
  Cardmembers with certain characteristics received the offer.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">There are, 
  however, circumstances in which we may share the information we collect about 
  you, as described in Section 1, with other companies in order to provide you 
  with access to products and services and to service your Account effectively, 
  as detailed below. We require these companies to adhere to our privacy standards 
  and to use this information only for the limited purpose for which it was shared. 
  We do not allow them to disclose it to others without our prior approval.
	</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">a. Sharing 
  Personal Information with Our Corporate Family</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">We are part 
  of the Morgan Stanley family of companies. Our corporate family 
  offers a wide variety of products and services that can help you manage your 
  finances. In order to provide you with access to these products and services, 
  we may share the information we collect about you, as described in Section 1, 
  with other members of our corporate family. These companies include financial 
  service providers that offer mortgage lending services, securities and asset 
  management services, investment opportunities and mutual funds, and may include 
  non-financial service providers in the future as our corporate family continues 
  to grow. </font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">b. Sharing 
  Personal Information with Non-Affiliated Parties for Marketing Purposes
	</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">We may share 
  the information we collect about you, as described in Section 1, with non-affiliated 
  third parties, including those that accept the Discover Card, in order to provide 
  you with access to products and services offered directly by these companies 
  that may be of value to you. These companies include financial service providers, 
  such as insurance companies, and non-financial companies, such as retailers.
	</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">c. Sharing 
  Personal Information with Others</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">We may share 
  the information we collect about you, as described in Section 1, with companies 
  that perform support or marketing services on our behalf, such as mailing, market 
  research and data processing; other financial institutions with which we have 
  joint marketing agreements; or companies that are our partners for cobrand credit 
  card programs or reward programs. We may also share such information as permitted 
  by law. </font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2"><b>3. How 
  Do We Protect the Confidentiality, Security and Integrity of Information About 
  You?</b></font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">We maintain 
  physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the information we 
  collect about you. Access to such information is restricted to individuals who 
  need it in order to service your Account or provide products and services to 
  you, and who are trained in the proper handling of such information. Employees 
  who violate these confidentiality requirements are subject to our disciplinary 
  process. Where third parties provide support services, we require them to conform 
  to our privacy standards.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">It is important 
  that the information we maintain about you is accurate and complete. If you 
  see information in your monthly billing statements or elsewhere which suggests 
  that our information is incomplete or inaccurate, please write to us at Discover 
  Card, P.O. Box 30943, Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0943 so that we can update this
  information.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2"><b>4. How 
  Can You Limit Sharing of Information About You?</b></font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">We respect 
  your privacy and offer you choices as to whether we may share information about 
  you with others. If you prefer that we not share the information we collect 
  about you, as described in Section 1, with non-affiliated third parties or if 
  you prefer that we not share that information with companies in our corporate 
  family, you may opt out, that is, you may direct us not to share that information. 
  If you indicate a preference that we do not share that information, please understand 
  that you will not receive offers for products and services provided by other 
  companies that could help you lower your costs, maximize your financial resources 
  and manage your finances.</font></p> 

<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2"><b>To indicate your preferences, 
  call us at 1-800-225-5202 or write to us at Discover Card, P.O. Box 30961, Salt
  Lake City, UT 84130-0961. If you have previously notified us about your privacy
  preferences, it is not necessary to do so again unless you decide to change your
  preferences.</b> Your written request should include your name, address, telephone number and 
  Account number(s) and should not be sent with any other correspondence. In order 
  to process your request, we require that the request be provided by you directly 
  and not through a third party. You will need to provide us with your preferences 
  for each credit card account you have with us. 
	</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">You may notify 
  us about your preferences at any time. If you have previously notified us, it 
  is not necessary to do so again unless you decide to change your preferences. 
  Your request will remain in effect until you notify us otherwise. We will honor 
  your request and not share the information we collect about you, except as permitted 
  by law. For example, federal law permits us to share information about you with 
  consumer reporting agencies, service providers and marketing partners. It also 
  permits us to share information about our experiences and transactions with 
  you, such as your Account balance and payment history, with other members of 
  our corporate family. If you are a new Cardmember, we will not share any information 
  about you, except as permitted by law, for thirty days after we provide this 
  Policy to you in order to give you a reasonable opportunity to inform us about 
  your preferences. If you are an existing Cardmember, please understand that 
  you may continue to receive marketing offers directly from other companies that 
  were already in production prior to the processing of your request.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">This Privacy 
  Policy is provided to the primary Cardmember listed on the Account. However, 
  any joint Cardmember has the right to notify us about preferences and we will 
  treat that request as applying to the entire Account. We do not share information 
  about former customers, except as permitted by law. </font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, verdana" size="2">We are required by federal law to
  provide you with a copy of our Privacy Policy each year. This Privacy 
  Policy is provided to you by Discover Bank and its subsidiaries, which currently 
  include GTC Insurance Agency, Inc. It applies to the Discover Platinum, Discover 
  Gold, Discover Classic and Discover Private Issue® Cards, and the products 
  and services offered in connection with those cards, including The Register® 
  card registration service (with the exception of any information registered 
  in connection with the service, which will not be shared) and the Discover® 
  Exchange payment service. It is part of your Cardmember Agreement and provides 
  a further explanation of how we collect and share information. You may have 
  other rights under state laws that apply to this information. Please note that 
  you will also receive privacy notices for other credit card accounts you have 
  with us, as well as other financial products and services provided to you by 
  us and our affiliates. You will need to indicate your preferences for each of 
  these separately as disclosed in the notice.</font></p>

The State of Vermont recently adopted new privacy regulations that require
financial institutions to obtain your consent prior to sharing information
about you with others. In order to comply with this new law, we will not
share information we collect about you with non-affiliated third parties
or companies in our corporate family, as described in Section 4 of our
Privacy Policy, unless you call and tell us to do so.</font><p></p>
