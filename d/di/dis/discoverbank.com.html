	<br><br>
	Our mission is to provide you with superior products and services, along 
	with the peace of mind knowing that your privacy is secure. We understand 
	your concerns about guarding information about you and your Account. We want 
	to assure you that we have taken steps, and will continue to take steps, to 
	safeguard that information.
	<br><br>
	This Privacy Policy describes our efforts to meet these objectives. It 
	includes a summary of the following important information: 
	<ul class="nomargin">
	<li>A listing of the personal information we collect</li>
	<li>The circumstances in which we may share information with others</li>
	<li>The ways we safeguard the confidentiality and security of information</li>
	<li>The steps you may take to limit our sharing of such information with 
	others. See Section 4 for complete details.</li>
	</ul>
	Please read our Privacy Policy carefully. It will help you understand how 
	we collect and share information.</span>
	<br><br>
	<span class="bodymediumSubtitle">1. What Personal Information Do We Collect?</span>
	<br><br>
	<span class="bodymediumText">
	To serve you better and manage our business, it is important that we collect 
	and maintain accurate personal information about you. We obtain this information 
	from applications and other forms you submit to us, from your dealings with 
	us and others, from consumer reporting agencies, and from other sources, such 
	as our web sites. For example:<br>
	<ul class="nomargin">
	<li>We may obtain information such as your name, address, and date of birth 
	from applications and other forms you submit to us.</li> 
  	<li>We may obtain information such as Account balances and your use of your 
	Account from your transactions and other dealings with us and others.</li>
  	<li>We may obtain information such as the balances of your loans with other 
	lenders and your payment history with others from consumer reporting agencies.</li>
  	<li>We may obtain information such as your Internet service provider, your 
	domain name, your computer's operating system and web browser, your web site 
	use, and your product and service preferences from your visits to our web sites.</li></ul></span>
	<br>
	<span class="bodymediumSubtitle">2. Is Personal Information Shared with Others?</span>
	<br><br>
	<span class="bodymediumText">
	We limit the sharing of information with others. Many of the offers you 
	receive for products and services are provided directly to you from us. For 
	example, a company may come to us with a special offer for our Depositors. After 
	careful consideration of the nature of the offer and the company, we will create 
	a list of Depositors who may be interested in the offer based on certain 
	characteristics. We will send the offer directly to those Depositors on 
	behalf of the company by, for example, including an insert in their Account 
	statement or mailing the offer ourselves. We control the information used to 
	make the offer; we do not share the list or any information about our Cardmembers 
	with the retailer. However, please understand that if you do receive 
	this type of offer from us and choose to take advantage of it, the retailer 
	may then learn information about you because only Cardmembers with certain 
	characteristics received the offer.
	<br><br>
	There are, however, circumstances in which we may share the information we 
	collect about you, as described in Section 1, with other companies in order 
	to provide you with access to products and services and to service your Account 
	effectively, as detailed below. We require these companies to adhere to our 
	privacy standards and to use this information only for the limited purpose for 
	which it was shared. We do not allow them to disclose it to others without our 
	prior approval. 
	<br><br>
	a. Sharing Personal Information with Our Corporate Family
	<br><br>
	 We are part of the Morgan Stanley family of companies. Our corporate family 
	 offers a wide variety of products and services that can help you manage your 
	 finances. In order to provide you with access to these products and services, we 
	 may share the information we collect about you, as described in Section 1, 
	 with other members of our corporate family. These companies include financial 
	 service providers that offer credit cards, mortgage lending services, securities 
	 and asset management services, investment opportunities and mutual funds, and 
	 may include non-financial service providers in the future as our corporate 
	 family continues to grow.
	<br><br>
	b. Sharing Personal Information with Non-Affiliated Parties for Marketing Purposes 
	<br><br>
	We may share the information we collect about you, as described in Section 1, 
	with non-affiliated third parties, including those that accept the Discover 
	Card, in order to provide you with access to products and services offered 
	directly by these companies that may be of value to you. These companies include 
	financial service providers, such as insurance companies, and non-financial 
	companies, such as retailers.
	<br>
	c. Sharing Personal Information with Others
	<br><br>
	We may share the information we collect about you, as described in Section 1, 
	with companies that perform support or marketing services on our behalf, such 
	as mailing, market research and data processing; or other financial institutions 
	with which we have joint marketing agreements. We may also share such information 
	as permitted by law. </span>
	<br><br>
	<span class="bodymediumSubtitle">3. How Do We Protect the Confidentiality, 
	Security and Integrity of Information About You?</span>
	<br><br>
	<span class="bodymediumText">
	We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect information 
	about you. Access to such information is restricted to individuals who need it in 
	order to service your Account or provide products and services to you, and who are 
	trained in the proper handling of such information. Employees who violate these 
	confidentiality requirements are subject to our disciplinary process. Where third 
	parties provide support services, we require them to conform to our privacy standards.
	<br><br>
	It is important that the information we maintain about you is accurate and complete. 
	If you see information in your monthly billing statements or elsewhere which suggests 
	that our information is incomplete or inaccurate, please write to us at Discover 
	Bank, P.O. Box 7112, Dover, DE 19903-9955 so that we can update this information. </span>
	<br><br>
	<span class="bodymediumSubtitle">4. How Can You Limit Sharing of Information About You?</span>
	<br><br>
	<span class="bodymediumText">
	We respect your privacy and offer you choices as to whether we may share information 
	about you with others. If you prefer that we not share the information we collect 
	about you, as described in Section 1, with non-affiliated third parties or if 
	you prefer that we not share that information with companies in our corporate 
	family, you may opt out, that is, you may direct us not to share that information. 
	If you indicate a preference that we do not share that information, please understand 
	that you will not receive offers for products and services provided by other 
	companies that could help you lower your costs, maximize your financial resources 
	and manage your finances.
	<br><br>
	<strong>To indicate your preferences, call us at 1-800-347-7000 or write to us 
	at Discover Bank, P.O. Box 7112, Dover, DE 19903-9955. If you have previously 
	notified us about your privacy preferences, it is not necessary to do so again 
	unless you decide to change your preferences.</strong> Your written request 
	should include your name, address, telephone number and Account number(s) and 
	should not be sent with any other correspondence. In order to process your request, 
	we require that the request be provided by you directly and not through a third 
	party. You will need to provide us with your preferences for each credit card 
	account you have with us.
	<br><br>
	You may notify us about your preferences at any time. If you have previously 
	notified us, it is not necessary to do so again unless you decide to change your 
	preferences. Your request will remain in effect until you notify us otherwise. We 
	will honor your request and not share the information we collect about you, except 
	as permitted by law. For example, federal law permits us to share information about 
	you with consumer reporting agencies, service providers and marketing partners. It 
	also permits us to share information about our experiences and transactions with 
	you, such as your Account balance and payment history, with other members of our 
	corporate family. If you are a new Depositor, we will not share any information about 
	you, except as permitted by law, for thirty days after we provide this Policy to 
	you in order to give you an opportunity to inform us about your preferences. If 
	you are an existing Depositor, please understand that you may continue to receive 
	marketing offers directly from other companies that were already in production 
	prior to the processing of your request.
	<br><br>
	This Privacy Policy is provided to the primary Depositor listed on the Account. 
	However, any joint Depositor has the right to notify us about preferences and we 
	will treat that request as applying to the entire Account. We do not share 
	information about former customers, except as permitted by law.
	<br><br>
	This Privacy Policy is provided to you by Discover Bank. It applies to Discover 
	CD and Money Market Accounts. It is part of your Deposit Agreement and provides 
	a further explanation of how we collect and share information. You may have other 
	rights under state laws that apply to this information. Please note that you will 
	also receive privacy notices for any credit card accounts you have with us, as 
	well as other financial products and services provided to you by us and our 
	affiliates. You will need to indicate your preferences for each of these separately 
	as disclosed in the notice. </span>
	<br><br>
	
	<span class="bodymediumText">
	<strong>Vermont and North Dakota Residents</strong> - Your state laws require 
	financial institutions to obtain your consent prior to sharing information about 
	you with others. Except as permitted by law, we will not share information we 
	collect about you with non-affiliated third parties or, if you are a Vermont 
	resident, with companies in our corporate family unless you call us at 
	1-800-347-7000 and authorize us to do so.
