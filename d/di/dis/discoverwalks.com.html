Keeping the information you share with us secure and ensuring your understanding of how we collect, use and maintain your information is important to us. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information, and while no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your information. It is always possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access your transmissions or private communications. Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures. We continually assess new technology for protecting information and, when appropriate, we upgrade our information security systems.</p><p><strong>User Consent</strong><br> By submitting Personal Information through the Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy. Because of its importance and to make it easier for you to find and review it, we have made this Privacy Policy into a separate document on the Site. However, bear in mind it is a part of our agreement with you, and it describes how and when we may make changes to these statements and terms, and how they become binding upon you. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time and without notice. Any changes to the Privacy Policy will be posted on the Site. We encourage you to check the page regularly as you will be bound by the changes once posted.</p><p><strong>Personal Information You Provide to Us</strong><br> When you contact us by sending us an e-mail, we will collect your e-mail address and any information contained in the email you send us.</p><p><strong>Personal Information Collected Via Technology</strong><br> As you navigate our Site, certain information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. When you enter the Site, we collect your browser type and IP address. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser.<br> We also use cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and viewed. This type of information is collected to better understand how you use the Site and make the Site more useful.</p><p>We may use automatically collected information and cookies to automatically update the Site; monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.</p><p>Although we may track the numbers of visitors to inform us on how best to update the Site and enhance the experience for all visitors, personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process. We use tracking information on an aggregated basis to help us operate the Site, enhance and improve and update the Site, improve the look of the Site and display advertising and marketing information.</p><p>An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track IP Addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our web page flow.</p><p><strong>Personal Information We Receive From Other Sources</strong><br> We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources, or from third parties that provide services for us in connection with the Site.
