information and protects your privacy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and
subject to our Terms of Use, which you should refer to for additional information relating
to privacy issues.</p>
<h2 class="divider">1.	Collecting information about you</h2>
<p>The Family Health Network will not collect or monitor personal information about you without your
consent unless we consider it is necessary:</p>

</ul><p></p>
<p>The Family Health Network will only collect personal information which has been obtained from you.
The amount of information will depend on you! You may provide us or an Affiliate with
information:</p>
<p></p><ul>

although you can reset your browser to refuse. </p>

<h2 class="divider">2.	Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>
<p>The Family Health Network will not use or disclose any personal information about you without your
consent or access your communications on the Network, unless we consider it is
necessary:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>to comply with the law</li>
<li>to comply with our Terms of Use</li>
<li>to protect the rights and/or property of The Family Health Network, the Network, Network
Users, Network Subscribers and Members or any other individual or entity,
including members of the public</li>
<li>to reduce or avoid a threat to anyone's health, safety or wellbeing</li>
<li>to provide services to you</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>The Family Health Network and its Affiliates recognize the trust you place in us when you provide us
with personal information. The Network may sometimes disclose this information to an
Affiliate or other individual or entity to facilitate the operation of the Network and the
provision of User services. In these instances, we may explicitly tell you that the data we
are collecting will be shared with third parties. In these cases those disclosures will
override anything to the contrary in this Policy. We will not otherwise disclose your
personal information without your consent. </p>
<p>We use your information on an aggregated basis to do such things as operate and enhance
the Network and sell and deliver advertising. We also use this data, both aggregated and
personal, to enhance your on-site experience by displaying content and marketing
messages that we believe will be of interest to you. We disclose aggregated information
about the Network to third parties. </p>
<p>Some online activities you choose to do necessarily lead to disclosure of your personal
information to third parties, such as when you include your name and email address in a
postcard or when you order merchandise. In these cases, again, your choice to disclose
personal information is voluntary. </p>
<p>We may share your personal information with third parties who provide services to our
Network in order to enhance the functionality available to you as part of the Network,
and to provide you with new products and services such as email and Member pages. We
may also use your personal information to provide information to you, such as
newsletters that you request or to personalize the Network in accordance with your
requests. </p>
<p>Under certain circumstances we may be forced to disclose information to the Government
or third parties, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or
private communications. In the event that we need to investigate or resolve possible
problems or inquiries, you expressly acknowledge, agree and authorize The Family Health Network to
disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other
Government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.</p>
<h2 class="divider">4.	Promotional Email </h2>
<p>If you have indicated as such, The Family Health Network and/or third parties may from time to time,
send e-mail messages to you
which offer products and services, contain advertisements, promotions, subscriptions or
registration-based services or other material. If you wish to discontinue receiving such
email, please disable promotions via the 'Change your details' link on your The Family Health Network
personal page or the relevant third party. Your preferences will then be updated immediately.</p>
<h2 class="divider">4.	Storage and Security of Personal Information</h2>
<p>The Family Health Network will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to maintain the accuracy and
security of any personal information we hold. The Family Health Network maintains its User
information in a secured database to protect the privacy of your "Locator Information",
that is, your name, email address, physical address, and/or other data that enables you to
be personally identified.</p>
<p>The Family Health Network uses firewalls and Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") encryption
technology to ensure the integrity and privacy of the information you pass to us via
the Internet, however, to take advantage of this, you must utilize a browser that
maintains 128bit encryption support. Where a Network service is provided from
overseas, your information is kept in secure databases and is protected by The Family Health Network's
security policies. Despite our best efforts, "Perfect Security" does not exist on
the Internet.</p>
<p>Our employees and data processors are bound to respect the confidentiality of any
personal information held by The Family Health Network. Despite this, The Family Health Network will not be held
responsible for any events which arise from any unauthorized access to your personal
information.
You should take care to protect your own personal information, including but not limited
to passwords and accounts. You should contact The Family Health Network immediately if you
become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. </p>
<h2 class="divider">5.	Accessing, Changing and Deleting your Personal Information</h2>
<p>You may at any time request a copy of your file from The Family Health Network. If you wish to
change the information we have about you or have it deleted entirely please contact
The Family Health Network. We will provide you with a copy of your file and do everything we
reasonably can to alter or delete your information, unless we are required to maintain
certain information for legal or other reasons. Please allow at least seven days for your
request to be processed.</p>
<h2 class="divider">6.	Links to Other Web Sites</h2>
<p>The Network provides links to Other Web sites which are not controlled by The Family Health Network.
We are not responsible for the conduct of any individual or entity associated with
these Other Web sites. You should familiarize yourself with the relevant Web site's
Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy before using their site or disclosing any of your
personal information to them.</p>
<h2 class="divider">7.	Children on the Network</h2>
<p>Children should always ask a parent or guardian for permission before sending any
personal information over the Internet, whether to us or anyone else. This includes
buying stuff!</p>
<p>We encourage all parents and guardians to make themselves aware of what their children
are up to on the Internet and discuss privacy and safety issues with them. Public
discussion areas on the Network are not private. Any information posted by your child in
