<p style="text-align: center;color: red;"><b>THE COCA-COLA COMPANY PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Coca-Cola Company and its affiliates (also collectively referred to as “<b>we</b>”. “<b>our</b>” and “<b>us</b>”) &nbsp;are concerned about privacy issues and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through activities that link to this Privacy Policy including websites (our “<b>Websites</b>”) and any mobile sites, applications, widgets, and other mobile interactive features (collectively, our “<b>Apps</b>”), through other services that we may offer in connections with our Websites and Apps, such as rewards programs, through our official social media pages that we control (our “<b>Social Media Pages</b>”), as well as through HTML-formatted email messages that we send to you (collectively, including the Social Media Pages, Apps and Websites, the “<b>Sites</b>”).&nbsp; By providing Personal Information to us, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="color: red;"><b>PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Personal Information We May Collect</b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>“<b>Personal Information</b>” is information that identifies you as an individual, such as:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>User name</li>
<li>Postal address (including billing and shipping addresses)</li>
<li>Telephone number (including home and mobile phone numbers)</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Credit and debit card number</li>
<li>Profile picture</li>
<li>Social media account ID</li>
<li>Country of residence</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In some cases, we may use a third party payment service to process purchases and/or collect donations made through the Sites.&nbsp; In these cases, your Personal Information may be collected by this third party and not by us, and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third party’s use or disclosure of your Personal Information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Sites, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How We May Collect Personal Information</b></p>

<p>We and our service providers may collect Personal Information in a variety of ways, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Through the Sites</b>:&nbsp; We may collect Personal Information through the Sites, e.g., when you sign up for a newsletter or make a purchase.</li>
<li><b>Offline</b>:&nbsp; We may collect Personal Information from you offline, such as when you contact customer service.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Online tracking</b>: Because we do not track our Site users over time and across third- party websites, we do not respond to browser do-not-track signals.</li>
<li><b>From Other Sources</b>:&nbsp; We may receive your Personal Information from other sources, such as public databases; joint marketing partners; social media platforms; from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms, as well as from other third parties.&nbsp; For example, if you elect to connect your social media account to your Website account, certain Personal Information from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include Personal Information that is part of your profile or your friends’ profiles.</li>
<li><b>Mobile usage</b>:&nbsp; If we are able to identify you as a user of a mobile app, we may, for example, link your activity with Coca-Cola&nbsp; brands&nbsp; to one of Coca-Cola's mobile applications. If you have downloaded one or more of our mobile applications, you can opt in to location sharing for additional application capabilities. For example, geo-location will use your device’s latitude and longitude or your device’s location capabilities (e.g. GPS or Wi-Fi) to let you receive information and offers. Or, in-store location through the use of your phone’s Bluetooth signal, LED light chip technologies, or other technologies will permit us to find nearby products for you, get you real-time offers, and more. To learn how to opt out of sharing your location with us, go to the Choices and Access section of this privacy policy.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Personal Information you provide through the Sites may be combined with Personal Information and Other Information that you provide to us (via online or offline means), that is publicly available, or that we may otherwise obtain online or offline, including, for example, from providers of demographic and other information, social media platforms and other third parties.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>How We May Use Personal Information</b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may use Personal Information:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>How We May Collect Other Information</b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>We and our third party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Through your browser or device</b>:&nbsp; Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, service provider, and the name and version of the Sites (such as the App) you are using.&nbsp; We use this information for statistical purposes as well as to ensure that the Sites function properly.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Through server log files</b>:&nbsp; Your “<b>IP Address</b>” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer or device that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).&nbsp; An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Sites, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.&nbsp; Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.&nbsp; We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Sites usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Sites.&nbsp; Please note that we treat IP Addresses, server log files and related information as Other Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.</p>


<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Using cookies</b>:&nbsp; Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer or device for recordkeeping and other purposes.&nbsp; We use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Sites.&nbsp; If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies.&nbsp; To learn more about cookies, please visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>.&nbsp; To learn more about our use of cookies, please see our cookies policy <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coca-colacompany.com/our-company/cookie-policy">http://www.coca-colacompany.com/our-company/cookie-policy</a>.</p>


<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Using Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Stored Objects (“Flash LSOs”)) and other similar technologies</b>:&nbsp; We may use Flash LSOs and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Sites.&nbsp; If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer or device, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained using the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" title="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Website Storage Settings Panel</a>. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html" title="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">Global Storage Settings Panel</a> and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer or device without you being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).&nbsp; Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Sites or our online content. We expect our service providers and technology suppliers to honor any decision by you to restrict or limit Flash LSOs, but we cannot guarantee that they will do so.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Using pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs or</b> <b>other similar technologies</b>:&nbsp; These may be used in connection with some Sites pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, track the actions of Sites users and email recipients, measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about Sites usage and response rates.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Through your use of an App.</b>&nbsp; When you download and use an App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>From you</b>:&nbsp; Information, such as date of birth, gender, personal characteristics, hobbies and interests, consumption habits, zip code and your preferred means of communication, may be collected when you voluntarily provide it.&nbsp; Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Sites.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Physical Location:</b>&nbsp; We may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or WiFi signals. We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content, including advertising. We may also share your device’s physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content, including advertising and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device’s location, but if you choose to deny such uses and/or sharing, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>By aggregating information</b>:&nbsp; Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Sites (for example, we may use Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>From your camera</b>: The Sites may include functionality that permits you to use live video streams from your device camera, if you have affirmatively activated the camera for use with the Sites. &nbsp;The functionality may work by identifying your facial features, such as your eyes, nose, mouth, and chin, in the video streams. &nbsp;The functionality does not use facial recognition to uniquely identify a specific face.&nbsp;This&nbsp;functionality is used to provide you with an enhanced interactive experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;We and our service providers do not collect, capture, or record the video-stream information or any information about faces in the video stream—the information stays on your device and is removed when you turn off the browser or app.&nbsp; However, we and our service providers may collect other information about how you use the functionality, such as how often and how long you use it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your zip code).&nbsp; If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p>
