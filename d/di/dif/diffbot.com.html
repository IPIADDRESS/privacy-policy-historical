<h3 id="howdoweuseyourdata">HOW DO WE USE YOUR DATA? &nbsp;</h3>

<p>TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES</p>

<p>SUBSCRIBER(S)</p>

<p>Subscriber data is used to provide the Service; process Service payments; facilitate support queries and requests. &nbsp;A Subscriber's failure to provide the personal data we need, may result in our inability to complete the transaction or provide the service.</p>

<p>SEARCH SUBJECT(S)</p>

<p>We do not control what information is collected by Subscribers or their purpose for use. To the extent any notices or consents are required, Subscribers are solely responsible for giving such notices or obtaining such consents. &nbsp;We do not use your personal data for activities where we believe that your interests are overridden by any unwarranted adverse impact on you.</p>

<p>Diffbot's primary role is to discover, categorize, and extract information on the Internet on behalf of, and as directed by, our Subscriber(s). &nbsp;Diffbot subscribers can use our service and query functionality to create their own lists of Search Subjects; add their own data about Search Subjects (which only they can access); and monitor Search Subjects: communications; employments, websites, social media presence, links (etc.).</p>

<p>We allow our Subscribers access to search results via our online platform(s) and/or API service(s) to enable our subscribers to view information the Subscribers may be interested in.</p>

<p>A Subscriber can submit a query using the Diffbot UI or API to access data collected and indexed from the Internet. Diffbot then returns a list of items or subjects and a custom data set is created (a list of entities, related entities and facts) that matches the Subscriber's search criteria. A Subscriber may also define the data to extract from a specific web page, a group of pages or domain by accessing a suite of extraction APIs, by extending an existing extraction API, or by creating a new API using custom rules which yields extracted data.</p>

<p>The main purpose for using your personal data is to create a repository of data regarding persons entities and make that data available to our subscribers on a fee basis. &nbsp;Your personal data may also be processed in one or more of the following ways:</p>

<p>Our customers can search the database via our online platform(s);</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Subscribers can create lists of Individuals' websites</p></li>

<li><p>Subscribers can export data from our query tool provided the data is used in accordance with all applicable laws and in accordance with our terms of use.</p></li>

<li><p>Some of our Subscribers can purchase wholesale access but only if they agree to use it in compliance with the law.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Please see Profiling and Tracking to see how your data is used for profiling and tracking.</p>

<p>LEGITIMATE INTERESTS</p>

<h3 id="aggregationofsearchsubjectdataisbeneficialtoyoubecauseitwillallowthesubscribertoreceivetargetedinformationthatmaybeofinterestoruseforduediligencejobsearchorotherevaluationorresearchpurposes">Aggregation of Search Subject data is beneficial to you because it will allow the Subscriber to receive targeted information that may be of interest or use for due diligence, job search or other evaluation or research purposes;. &nbsp;</h3>

<h3 id="validatingaccesstocontent">VALIDATING ACCESS TO CONTENT</h3>

<p>SUBSCRIBERS</p>

<p>For Subscribers, we use the Personal Data of Subscribers (i.e. login; passwords, API tokens) to validate their right to use our Services.</p>

<p>SEARCH SUBJECTS &nbsp;</p>

<p>We will use Personal Data of Search Subjects to validate their identities in connection with the exercise of an EU (or other applicable jurisdiction's) data subject's rights or in the case of non-EU data subjects not subject to such legally required rights, to validate their identities prior to processing any removal or update requests.</p>

<h3 id="directmarketing">DIRECT MARKETING</h3>

<p>SUBSCRIBERS</p>

<p>Customers can opt out of receiving marketing materials via email or mail at any time while receiving the Service. &nbsp;If you receive email, newsletter or marketing communications from us and no longer wish to receive them, please follow the removal instructions in the email or change your account settings.</p>

<p>SEARCH SUBJECTS</p>

<p>We do not market to Search Subjects or commercially sell data not otherwise publicly available.</p>

<p>TRACKING AND PROFILING FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE PURPOSES, STATISTICAL AND TO FULFILL OBLIGATIONS TO OUR SUBSCRIBERS.</p>

<p>SUBSCRIBERS</p>

<p>Subscriber tracking is used to improve the Services and Site and includes: &nbsp;length of use; time and date service was used; search queries; API requests; and how the service was accessed (app; desktop; phone)</p>

<p>SEARCH SUBJECTS</p>

<p>We and third-party service providers may collect certain tracking information about your personal data for automated aggregation, indexing, and/or categorization purposes. &nbsp;The aggregation/categorization/indexing is limited and collected from the public domain; i.e. collected from information you publish on the internet and make public. For example, we catalog your subject matter expertise, interests, employments, education, and skills, and make this information available to our customers in response to Subscribers' particular queries they make when using our service. &nbsp;While we do not have the means to contact the millions of Search Subjects indexed through crawling, we will honor applicable data subject rights requests subject to our confirmation of your identity.</p>

<p>DATA SUBJECT PROFILING</p>

<p>We combine the personal data and information from publicly available websites and present this information to our Subscribers via our Service. &nbsp;Our Subscribers are able to search publicly accessible sources using APIs or a search dashboard. This allows our Customers to do due diligence on Individuals with whom they wish to build a business relationship or collect and use data for other legitimate purposes.</p>

<p>We also offer a service that uses APIs to structure hundreds or thousands of web pages into a single, searchable index.&nbsp;In doing so, the Subscriber may collect and create profiles containing Personal Data.</p>

<p>Targeting</p>

<p>Our Subscribers can understand your subject matter expertise, areas of interest, services offered, or subjects you are interested in thereby allowing our Subscriber(s) to target Search Subjects or other search criteria. &nbsp;</p>

<p>View and Evaluate Your Content</p>

<p>Via our service, a Subscriber can search and categorize your content, which may be given an automatically generated "relevance" score or be categorized/labeled, by Diffbot's technology; The Subscriber can extract data from the aggregated data that matches their query or create graphs based on the indexes they build. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Automated Decision-making</p>

<p>We use automated techniques such as visual layout analysis and classification, computer vision, text analytics, machine learning, and knowledge fusion to identify and classify data, extract and understand data on webpages which can be used to develop algorithms for even more robust automation. &nbsp;Diffbot does not use the output of automated data processing as the sole basis for any decisions regarding a Search Subject.</p>

<p>HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR DATA?</p>

<p>We will not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties outside of Diffbot without your consent, except in the following ways:</p>

<p>Subscribers (Applicable to Search Subjects): &nbsp;Our subscribers are typically businesses or institutions and come from all sectors. &nbsp;We share your data with our subscribers by allowing them access to extract data from the internet through our online services.</p>

However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to any third party request to compel disclosure of your information.</p>

<p>Business Transfer: &nbsp;Diffbot may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Data, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. &nbsp;Under such circumstances, Diffbot will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify its users if their personal information is to be disclosed or transferred and/or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

<p>Third Parties: &nbsp;We sometimes contract with other companies and individuals to perform functions or services on our behalf. &nbsp;Our categories of service providers include: software maintenance, data hosting, sending email messages, project management and customer service. &nbsp;We necessarily have to share your Personal Data with such third parties as may be required to perform their functions.
