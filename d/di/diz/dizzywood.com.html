			<h2>Dizzywood Privacy Policy	/ California Privacy Rights</h2>

<p>Dizzywood is committed to providing a fun, entertaining, and safe website for people of all ages. Our information practices are designed to comply with the United States Federal Trade Commission's Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.  This Privacy Policy is part of our Terms of Use for the Site. Please review this Privacy Policy regularly so that you will be aware of any changes to it. Your continued use of the Site and/or provision of personally identifiable information by you to us following any such revision means you accept and will be subject to the revised Privacy Policy. Any terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meanings given such terms in the Terms of Use.</p>

<h3>Personal Information Collection and Use Policies.</h3>

<p>It is our policy in to require only the minimal collection of information from our users. We do not condition a child's participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.</p> 

<p>To become an active member of Dizzywood, we ask for a screen name and a password. In order to comply with federal guidelines for protecting children of younger than 13 years of age, we also require the birth month and year.</p>

<p>For users under the age of 13 years, we also collect a parent's email address. For users age 13 and over, we require an email address of either the user or a parent. The email addresses we collect are only used for our automated account activation and password retrieval systems and to verify parental consent of children to use the Site. We do not send announcements, marketing materials, or other general communications to our users through email.</p>

<p>We ask for the gender of our users. Users may also have the option of giving us their city and state (but NOT the street address). Information such as gender, age, city, and state provide us with valuable demographics that will allow us to continue developing Dizzywood in ways that suit our audience. We use this information internally in Dizzywood to improve function and quality of our site. While this information may be personal in nature, it is not personally identifiable because it cannot be used to identify who you are.</p>

<p>If an account has been inactive for 12 months or longer, all of this user information associated with the account is purged from our database.</p>

<h3>Parental Review of Information</h3>

<p>Parents, please send a letter or postcard to our Privacy Manager at the mailing address provided below if you would like to do any of the following:</p>

<p>Access the personally identifiable information that Dizzywood has collected online from your child, correct factual errors in such information, request to have this information deleted, or request that we no longer collect or maintain such information. Please note that this may require that we cancel and delete your child's account.</p>

<p>Please be sure to include your email address and a telephone number where we can reach you. To protect your child's privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting you access to the personal information that we collect and maintain about your child.</p>

<h3>Communication Tools</h3>

<p>Dizzywood's communication tools facilitate interactivity within our community. These tools include chat, internal mail, and message boards. These channels of communication are considered as being higher risk, and may result in users voluntarily providing personal information. Dizzywood chat, internal mail, and message boards are protected by our proprietary filter technology, selective monitoring by staff members, and peer reporting, but they are NOT moderated continuously on a 24-hour basis.</p>


<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>Dizzywood uses a software technology called "cookies." Cookies are small text files that we place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. Cookies themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information. Although cookies could enable us to relate a visitor's use of this web site to personal information that a visitor has provided, such as an email address, we do not use them for this purpose. We do use "cookies" to determine how many visitors we have and how often they visit various sections of our site.</p>


<h3>Web Visit Logs</h3>

<p>We may collect information about you through technology we use to make our web site more interesting and useful to you. We routinely collect our users' visit information including pages visited on Dizzywood, the date and time of the visit, IP address, and the version of browser used. We use this information for improving Dizzywood's content and services and for investigating cases of suspected abuse.</p>

<h3>Third Parties</h3>

<p>We do not share any personally identifiable information of our users with any third parties, commercial or otherwise, except that we may provide such information to parties involved in a merger, consolidation or other reorganization of Dizzywood or to a party that purchases substantially all of our assets related to the Site. We may, however, also comply with requests for personally identifiable information from law enforcement or other governmental agencies, or requested pursuant to subpoena. We may share aggregated statistical data with our sponsors, partners, or the general public.</p>

<h3>Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
