<h3><a name="Why_we_need_your_information"></a>Why we need your information</h3>

<p>We will use your information to give you quotations, and manage your insurance policy, including underwriting and claims handling. 
Your information comprises of all the details we hold about you and your transactions and includes information we obtain about you from third parties. 
We will only collect the information we need so that we can provide you with the service you expect from us. 
From time to time we may need to change the way we use your information. Where we believe you may not reasonably expect such a change we will write to you. When we do so, you will have 60 days to object to the change but if we do not hear from you within that time you consent to that change.</p>

<p>Direct Line insurance policies are underwritten by U K Insurance Limited (UKI).  When you give us your information, it will be shared within the UKI owned brands. We will do that in order to provide you with the best possible products and service experience.</p>

<p>During the course of our dealings with you we may need to disclose some of your information to other insurers, third party underwriters, reinsurers, credit reference and fraud prevention and law prevention agencies and other companies that provide service to us or you, to:</p>

<ul>
<li>assess financial and insurance risks</li>

<li>prevent and detect crime</li>
<li>develop our products, services, systems and relationships with you</li>
<li>understand our customers’ requirements</li>

<h3><a name="Where_we_transfer_your_information"></a>Where we transfer your information</h3>

<p>From time to time we may require services from suppliers that are based worldwide and your information will be shared with them for the purposes of providing that service. Where we engage these suppliers we make sure that they apply the same levels of protection, security and confidentiality we apply.  However, such information may be accessed by law enforcement agencies and other authorities to prevent and detect crime and comply with legal obligations.</p>
<br>
<a href="#" class="backtotop">back to top</a><p></p>

<h3><a name="Motor_Insurance_Database_(MID)"></a>Motor Insurance Database (MID)</h3>

<p>Information relating to your policy will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID) managed by the Motor Insurers’ Bureau (MIB). The MID and the data stored on it may be used by certain statutory and/or authorised bodies including the Police, the DVLA, the DVANI, the Insurance Fraud Bureau and other bodies permitted by law for purposes not limited to but including:
</p><ul>
<li>Electronic Licensing (Tax Discs);</li>
<li>Continuous Insurance Enforcement;</li>
<li>Law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and/or prosecution of offenders);</li>
<li>The provision of government services and/or other services aimed at reducing the level and incidence of uninsured driving.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>If you are involved in a road traffic accident (either in the UK, the EEA or certain other territories), insurers and/or the MIB may search the MID to obtain relevant information.</p>

<p>Persons (including his or her appointed representatives) pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID.</p>

<p>It is vital that the MID holds your correct registration number. It is our responsibility to update your policy to the MID. We fully comply with the agreements in place with the MIB to update your details within seven days; however it is important that you check your policy documents ensuring that the registration number is recorded correctly.</p>

<p>If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your car seized by the Police. You can check that your correct registration number is shown on the MID at <a title="www.askMID.com (opens in a new browser)" href="http://www.askMID.com/" target="_blank">www.askMID.com</a>.</p>

<p>If the registration number is not shown correctly on your policy documents, or you cannot find your car on the MID, please contact us immediately.</p>

<p><strong>What is a cookie?</strong></p>

<p>A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. Cookies are used to make websites work and improve the efficiency of a website. Cookies are also used to ensure that we provide effective security when using of our website.  Cookies can help a website to arrange content to match your preferred interests more quickly - most major websites use cookies. Cookies alone cannot be used to identify you.</p>

<p>A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come; the "lifetime" of the cookie; and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.</p> 

<p>Two types of cookies are used on this website:</p>

<p><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> These are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you close your browser.</p>

<p><strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> These are stored on your computer until they expire or you remove them.</p>

<p>Persistent cookies store your personal preferences such as your language preferences on multi-lingual sites to make subsequent visits easier. They also remember questions we have asked you previously, such as a request to complete an online survey. A persistent cookie will prevent you from being asked to complete the same survey every time you visit the website.</p>

<p><strong>Third party cookies:</strong> We work with third parties who, on our behalf, research the use of our website and activities on it. In doing so they may place a cookie on your computer. However it would not contain any personal information that others could read and understand.
We also work with third parties to evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions on third party websites. Again, the cookie would not contain any personal information that others could read and understand.</p>

<p><strong>Further information on cookies</strong></p>

<p>If you would like further information on cookies, please go to <a title="www.allaboutcookies.org (opens in a new browser)" onclick="SiTrackTracer('/si/event/tracklink','id=main/legal/cookies');" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>


<h3>Further Security</h3>

<p>We take security very seriously and we use one of the strongest available security systems to protect your communications with us. Whenever you fill in a form, such as a request for a quote, it is automatically protected using something called a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) between your computer and ours. SSL works in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>It prevents impersonation - you can tell that you are using a genuine SSL site by the padlock symbol at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on either the padlock or the image opposite will reveal our Registration Certificate that is issued by Verisign, a leading Internet security company.*</li>
<li>It encrypts data - as soon as your computer has recognised our computer they encrypt all information that is passed between them. Data encryption means that no one else can read or change your information as it travels over the Internet.</li>
<li>It prevents scrambling - SSL uses a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to prevent anyone tampering with our Internet site. Your computer will always check this code before it takes a message from us. This means that if anyone tried to interfere with a message, your computer would not recognise the code and would alert you.</li>

<p>*There are two minor problems with Microsoft Internet Explorer. Neither problem has any effect on the actual security in force, but may make it appear to you as if it is not fully secure.<br>
Internet Explorer 4. The padlock symbol does not always appear at the bottom when it should. A full description of this error, number Q154621, is at <a title="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q154/6/21.asp (opens in a new browser)" href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q154/6/21.asp" target="_blank">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q154/6/21.asp</a>.</p>

<p>Internet Explorer 5. If you click on the padlock symbol to view the security certificate the following message may be displayed: "This certificate has failed to verify for all of its intended purposes". The other details of the certificate shown are correct. A full description of this error, number Q233479, is at <a title="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q233/4/79.asp (opens in a new browser)" href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q233/4/79.asp" target="_blank">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q233/4/79.asp</a>.</p>
