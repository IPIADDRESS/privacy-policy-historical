			<h3><strong><a id="term11" title="Motor Insurance Database"></a>Motor Insurance Database</strong></h3>
			<p>Information relating to your policy will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID) managed by the Motor Insurers’ Bureau (MIB). The MID and the data stored on it may be used by certain statutory and/or authorised bodies including the Police, the DVLA, the DVANI, the Insurance Fraud Bureau and other bodies permitted by law for purposes not limited to but including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Electronic Licensing (Tax Discs),</li>
				<li>Continuous Insurance Enforcement,</li>
				<li>Law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and/or prosecution of offenders),</li>
				<li>The provision of government services and/or other services aimed at reducing the level and incidence of uninsured driving.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you are involved in a road traffic accident (either in the UK, the EEA or certain other territories), insurers and/or the MIB may search the MID to obtain relevant information.</p>
			<p>Persons (including his or her appointed representatives) pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID.</p>
			<p>It is vital that the MID holds your correct registration number. It is our responsibility to update your policy to the MID. We fully comply with the agreements in place with the MIB to update your details within seven days; however it is important that you check your policy documents ensuring that the registration number is recorded correctly.</p>
			<p>If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your car seized by the Police. You can check that your correct registration number is shown on the MID at www.askMID.com.</p>
			<p>If the registration number is not shown correctly on your policy documents, or you cannot find your car on the MID, please contact us immediately.</p>

			<h2 class="small-spaced-wrapper"><a id="term12" tilte="Website Security"></a>2 – Website Security</h2>
			<p>Any personal data saved is held safely on our mainframe computer, with security systems preventing unauthorised access and we always ensure it is treated confidentially.</p>
			<p>We take security very seriously and we use one of the strongest available security systems to protect your communications with us. Whenever you fill in a form, such as a request for a quote, it is automatically protected using something called a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) between your computer and ours. SSL works in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It prevents impersonation – you can tell that you are using a genuine SSL site by the padlock symbol at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on either the padlock or the image opposite will reveal our Registration Certificate that is issued by Verisign, a leading Internet security company.*</li>
				<li>It encrypts data – as soon as your computer has recognised our computer they encrypt all information that is passed between them. Data encryption means that no one else can read or change your information as it travels over the Internet.</li>
				<li>It prevents scrambling – SSL uses a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to prevent anyone tampering with our Internet site. Your computer will always check this code before it takes a message from us. This means that if anyone tried to interfere with a message, your computer would not recognise the code and would alert you.</li>
			</ul>

                Premiums stop after your 90th birthday but you still enjoy cover for the rest of your life.&nbsp;In the first year, if you die from natural causes we will refund any premiums, or if you die as a result of an accident, we will pay your cash sum. After the first year regardless of the cause of death we will pay your cash sum.&nbsp;Depending on how long you live, the total sum paid in premiums may be more than the cash sum payable on death.&nbsp;If you stop paying your premiums before the end of your policy your cover will stop 30 days after your missed premium and you won’t get anything back.
                This isn’t a savings or investment product and has no cash value unless a valid claim is made.&nbsp;Inflation will reduce the buying power of your cash sum in the future. </p>
