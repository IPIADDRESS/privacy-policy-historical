                  <p>At DirectIQ, we respect and protect   the privacy of our customers and those who use our website. The following   Privacy Statement provides details about how your personal information   is collected and used. This privacy statement applies to the DirectIQ   website, products and services that are located in, but not limited to the <a href="http://www.directiq.com" target="_blank">DirectIQ.com</a> domain. </p>
                  <p><span class="whitemedhead">Information Collection and Use &nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p>                  DirectIQ is the sole owner of information collected on this site. We   will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different   from what is disclosed in this statement. DirectIQ collects information   from our users at several different points on our website. </p>
                  <p>Our website offers several opportunities   for visitors to register for promotional and informational mailings,   online webinars and resources, and for assistance in evaluating our   software and services. These registration forms enable users to opt-in   to DirectIQ's mailing lists and require users to give contact information   (such as name and email address). We use this contact information to   send information about our company and our products and services. Notice   is given at the point of collection to enable users to choose whether   or not they consent to the usage terms. Those who have signed up and   subsequently wish to withdraw their participation may opt-out of receiving   future mailings at any time (see the choice/opt-out section below).</p>
                  <p>We also keep track of activity on our   website via log files stored on our web servers. We collect information   such as IP address, browser type and version, and pages you view. We   also keep track of how you got to our site and any links you click on   to leave our site. We use our logs of your website activity to assist   us in offering you a personalized Web experience, assist you with technical   support, diagnose problems with our server, administer our website and   to tailor our product and service offerings to you.</p>
                  <p><span class="whitemedhead">Security and Privacy</span>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p> We take every precaution to protect the confidentiality and security   of your personal information by using industry-recognized security safeguards   such as firewalls, coupled with carefully developed security procedures   to protect your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration.   When we collect sensitive account information such as credit card numbers,   we protect its transmission through the use of encryption such as the   Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
                  <p>DirectIQ takes care to reinforce the   importance of our website visitors' security and privacy among our employees.   Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information   and, using physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, we restrict   access to personal information to those employees and agents for business   purposes only. Additionally, we use internal and external resources   to review the adequacy of our security procedures.</p>
                  <p>We will never share, sell, or rent   your personal information with third parties for their promotional use.   Occasionally, we enter into contracts with third parties so that they   can assist us in servicing you (for example, providing customer service).   The contracts prohibit them from using any of your personal information   for their own purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality   of the information we provide to them. We may also disclose information   to partners who introduced you to DirectIQ's services in order to ensure   they are properly compensated for their efforts. Lastly, we may disclose   or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe   in good faith that disclosure is required under the law. For example,   we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with   regulators or law enforcement authorities, to comply with a legal process   such as court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request.</p>
                  <p><span class="whitemedhead">Cookies and Web Beacons</span>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p> We use a variety of technologies on our sites. Among these are cookies:   a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie   file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website   can remember your browser in the future. A cookie will typically contain   the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime"   of the cookie, and a value, usually a unique number. When you visit   our website, open our email, or encounter our services online (perhaps   on a customer's website) we may send you a cookie. Cookies may be used   in many ways: they allow us to verify the login status of customers   using products or services linked directly with our website, track point   of entry to point of registration for those users participating in our   affiliate signup programs, and track and measure the success of a particular   marketing campaign. Cookies also allow us to track overall site usage   and determine areas users prefer, enabling us to make your visit to   our website easier by recognizing you when you return and helping to   provide you with a customized experience.</p>
                  <p>Usage of a cookie is in no way linked   to any personally identifiable information while on our site. You have   the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in   your browser. If you choose to disable cookies, you may still use our   site; however, you may have limited access to some areas within our   website. For more information on how to manage cookies in your web browser,   see <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org" target="_blank"><u>http://www.aboutcookies.org</u></a>.</p>
                  <p>Some of our web pages, emails, and   other online content may contain electronic images known as web beacons,   also known as single-pixel GIFs, which are invisible graphical images.   These web beacons allow us to count users who have visited our web pages,   seen our ads, or opened our email. Web beacons collect only limited   information, such as a cookie identifier, time and date of a page being   viewed, and a description of the page on which the Web Beacon resides   (the URL).</p>
                  <p>When we send you emails, we may include   a web beacon to allow us to determine the number of people who open   our emails. When you click on a link in an email, we record this individual   response to allow us to customize our offerings to you.</p>
                  <p>Web Beacons cannot be declined when   delivered via a regular web page. However, Web Beacons can be refused   when delivered via email. If you do not wish to receive Web Beacons   via email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select   Text only) emails via your email software.</p>
                  <p><span class="whitemedhead">Choice/Opt-out</span>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p> DirectIQ's Anti-Spam policy tolerates only permission-based email. In   addition, users always have the opportunity to opt-out or change preferences   via a link in the footer of all non-transactional email messages. These   options are made available when you sign-up for our email lists and   in email messages delivered from our company. Alternatively, you may   email us at <a href="mailto:support@directiq.com" target="_blank"><u>support@directiq.com</u></a>. If you believe that you have received an   unsolicited commercial email from DirectIQ on behalf of any of our customers,   you may report it to us at <a href="mailto:abuse@directiq.com" target="_blank"><u>abuse@directiq.com</u></a>.</p>
                  <p>Some communications (e.g. important   account notifications and billing information) are considered transactional   and are necessary for all DirectIQ customers. You must cancel your DirectIQ   account to unsubscribe from these communications. To cancel your DirectIQ   account, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@directiq.com" target="_blank"><u>support@directiq.com</u></a>.</p>
                  <p><span class="whitemedhead">Links</span>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p> Some of our sites provide links to third-party websites, such as those   of our business partners and online advertising partners. While on these   sites, DirectIQ or its partners may collect information about you. Because   DirectIQ does not control the information policies or practices of these   third parties, you should review their privacy policies to learn more   about how they collect and use personally identifiable information.</p>
                  <p><span class="whitemedhead">Notification of Changes</span>&nbsp;</p>
                <p> This policy is in effect as of July 2009. If we decide to change our   privacy policy, we will post those changes on the DirectIQ Website so   our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use   it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
