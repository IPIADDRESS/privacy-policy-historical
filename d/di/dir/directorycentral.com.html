      <h1>Privacy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective December 15, 2008: </strong></p>
      <p>SocialTerrain, Inc. ("SocialTerrain" or "we") operates SocialTerrain.Com. This Privacy Policy describes SocialTerrain's use and sharing of personally identifiable information (your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, or credit card
      number) that Members voluntarily provide to SocialTerrain when they register (also
      known as "Registration PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION"). The Term "User" refers
      to a Visitor or a Member. This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by
      SocialTerrain, including any SocialTerrain-branded URL (the "SocialTerrain Website"),
      the SocialTerrain instant messaging service, the SocialTerrain application developer
      service and other features (for example, music and video embedded players), SocialTerrain
      mobile services, and any other features, content, or applications offered from time
      to time by SocialTerrain in connection with the SocialTerrain Website (collectively,
      the "SocialTerrain Services"). The SocialTerrain Services are hosted in the United
      States.
      </p> 
      <p>
      The SocialTerrain Website is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect
      PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION from children under 13 years of age.
      </p>
      <p>
      From time to time SocialTerrain may modify this Privacy Policy to reflect industry
      initiatives or changes in the law, our PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION collection
      and use practices, the features of the SocialTerrain Services, or technology, and
      such modifications shall be effective upon posting by SocialTerrain on the SocialTerrain
      Website. Your continued use of the SocialTerrain Services after SocialTerrain posts
      a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
      It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure
      you are updated as to any changes. If SocialTerrain materially changes its practices
      regarding collection or use of your PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, your PERSONALLY
      IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION will continue to be governed by the Policy under which
      it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected
      to, the change.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong style="color: #FF0000">COLLECTION AND SUBMISSION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
      AND NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ON SOCIALTERRAIN</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>
      General. When SocialTerrain collects PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION from you
      it is because you are voluntarily submitting Registration PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
      INFORMATION to us in order to register as a Member of SocialTerrain. SocialTerrain
      may also collect PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION from you if you choose to participate
      in SocialTerrain Services activities like sweepstakes, contests, and surveys, because
      you want us to furnish you with products, services, newsletters, or information,
      or in connection with content or suggestions you submit to SocialTerrain for review.
      </p>
      <p>
      In addition, SocialTerrain collects other non-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
      including IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type. This data is used to
      manage and improve the SocialTerrain Services, track usage, and for security purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
      SocialTerrain Members may also choose to provide or store non-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
      INFORMATION in their profiles, including but not limited to date of birth, interests,
      hobbies, lifestyle choices, groups with whom they are affiliated (schools, companies),
      videos and/or pictures, private messages, bulletins or personal statements (collectively
      "Profile Information"). The Profile Information in a Member's profile is provided
      at his or her sole discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
      SocialTerrain Members can change their Registration PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
      and Profile Information at any time and can control how Visitors, other Members
      and SocialTerrain communicate with them by controlling their account settings, available
      within the "Edit Profile" portion of their SocialTerrain profile. Link to Privacy
      Settings.
      </p>
      <p>
      Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that SocialTerrain places on your
      computer. SocialTerrain uses cookies to identify your Internet browser, store Users'
      preferences, and determine whether you have installed the enabling software needed
      to access certain material on the SocialTerrain Services. Data in cookies may be
      read to authenticate user sessions or provide services.
      </p>
      <p>
      Third party advertisements displayed on SocialTerrain Services may also contain
      cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers (known as "third party
      cookies"). SocialTerrain does not control these third party cookies and Users of
      the SocialTerrain Services should check the privacy policy of the Internet advertising
      company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. See the "Notice" section
      below for more information on customized advertising on SocialTerrain. A pixel tag
      is a tiny image inserted in a webpage and used to record the number and types of
      views for that page. SocialTerrain may allow third party pixel tags to be present
      on SocialTerrain Services for purposes of advertising, providing services or data
      and statistics collection.
      </p>
      <p>
      You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, block
      third party cookies or block all cookies. However, by blocking all cookies you may
      not have access to certain features on the SocialTerrain Services
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong style="color: #FF0000">NOTICE: SOCIALTERRAIN WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS
      PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES </strong>														
      </p>
      <p>
      When you voluntarily provide PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION to SocialTerrain,
      we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how
      and why the information is being collected and the types of uses SocialTerrain will
      make of the information to the extent it is being used in a manner that differs
      from what is allowed pursuant to this Privacy Policy.														
      </p>
      <p>
      At the time you provide your PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, SocialTerrain
      will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
      INFORMATION (See "Choice" below). Except as described in this Privacy Policy, SocialTerrain
      will not share your PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION with third parties unless
      you have given SocialTerrain permission to do so (See "Use" below).
      </p>
      <p>
      SocialTerrain Services may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies.
      SocialTerrain Services may also carry advertisements from other companies. SocialTerrain
      is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites or other services operated
      by third parties that are linked to or integrated with the SocialTerrain Services
      or for the privacy practices of third party Internet advertising companies. Once
      you leave SocialTerrain Services via such a link, access a third party application
      (such as widgets) or click on an advertisement, you should check the applicable
      privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine, among other things,
      how they will handle any PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION they collect from you.
      </p>
      <p>
      SocialTerrain may use cookies and similar tools to customize the content and advertising
      you receive based on the Profile Information you have provided. Profile Information
      you provide in structured profile fields or questions (multiple choice questions
      like "Marital Status," "Education" and "Children") ("Structured Profile Information"),
      information you add to open-ended profile fields and questions (essay questions
      like "About Me," "Interests" and "Movies") ("Non-Structured Profile Information")
      and other non-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION about you may also be used to
      customize the online ads you encounter to those we believe are aligned with your
      interests. For example, based on your music interests we might display an advertisement
      to make sure you are advised when your favorite band is coming to town. The information
      used for this feature does not provide your PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
      or identify you as an individual to third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
      Some of the advertisements that appear on SocialTerrain Services may also be delivered
      to you by third party Internet advertising companies. These companies utilize certain
      technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect non-PERSONALLY
      IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION about your visit to or use of SocialTerrain Services, including
      information about the ads they display, via a cookie placed on your computer that
      reads your IP address.														
      </p>
      <p>
      Third party applications (such as widgets) created by third party developers may
      also be available on the SocialTerrain Services. Third party applications are small
      bits of software, often with interactivity, that can be installed into Members'
      profiles or shared with other Users. However, SocialTerrain does not control the
      third party developers, and cannot dictate their actions. When a Member engages
      with a third party application, that Member is interacting with the third party
      developer, not with SocialTerrain. SocialTerrain encourages Members not to provide
      PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION to the third party's application unless the
      Member knows the party with whom it is interacting.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong style="color: #FF0000">CHOICE: SOCIALTERRAIN WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT
      THE USE OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION </strong>														
      </p>
      <p>
      Except as described in this Privacy Policy, SocialTerrain will get your permission
      before we use the PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION you provide to us in a way
      that is inconsistent with the purpose for which it was submitted or share your PERSONALLY
      IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION with third parties that are not affiliated with SocialTerrain.														
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong style="color: #FF0000">USE: SOCIALTERRAIN'S USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
      </strong>														
      </p>
      <p>
      SocialTerrain will only use the PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION you provide
      under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
      If SocialTerrain obtains PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION from a third party,
      such as a business partner, our use of that information is also governed by this
      Privacy Policy.														
      </p>
      <p> 
      In order to locate other SocialTerrain Members that you may already know in the
      physical world, SocialTerrain allows Users to search for Members using Registration
      PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (i.e., full name or email address). SocialTerrain
      also allows Users to browse for certain Profile Information in order to help connect
      with Members (i.e., schools and/or companies where Users may have attended or worked).
      SocialTerrain may also enable Members to publicly display some Registration PERSONALLY
      IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION as an element of their Profile Information if they choose
      to do so via a profile setting under "Edit Profile." Search engines may index the
      portion of a Member's profile (including the Profile Information it contains) that
      is publicly displayed.
      </p>
      <p> 
      If you have consented to receive promotional materials (e.g., newsletters) or notifications
      from SocialTerrain, SocialTerrain may periodically use your email address to send
      you such materials related to the SocialTerrain Services, as applicable. If you
