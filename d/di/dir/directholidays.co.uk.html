We may not provide you with a copy of your personal information if it includes the personal information of other individuals or we have another lawful reason to withhold that information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Please see the section titled ‘How to Contact Us’ if you need to make a Data Subject Access Request.</p><h3>Correcting and updating your personal information</h3><p>The accuracy of your information is important to us and we are working on ways to make it easier for you to review and correct the information that we hold about you.</p><p>In the meantime, if you change your name or address/e-mail address, or you discover that any of the other information we hold is inaccurate or out of date, please let us know by contacting our customer service team <a href="https://support.thomascook.com/?website=thomascook/#intcmp=TopNav_CustomerSupport" target="_blank">here</a> or your local store (if you booked at that store).</p><h3>Withdrawing your consent</h3><p>Where we rely on your consent as the legal basis for processing your personal information, as set out in section above titled ‘<strong>How do we use your information when providing our services to you</strong>’, you may withdraw your consent at any time.
