                        your data from unauthorised access).<br>

                        advertising and marketing information from those selected 
                        third parties without passing control of your personal

                        products and services ordered or used by you. For example, 
                        we may disclose your data to a credit card company to 
                        validate your credit card details and obtain payment when 
                        you buy a product or service. It may also be necessary

                        <br>
                        Direct Ferries recognises that its customers are increasingly 
                        concerned about how companies protect personal information 
                        from misuse and abuse and about privacy in general. Direct 
                        Ferries is constantly reviewing and enhancing its technical, 
                        physical and managerial procedures and rules to protect 
                        your personal data from unauthorised access, accidental 
                        loss and/or destruction. We use industry standard secure 
                        sockets layer (SSL) technology, for example, to encrypt 
                        sensitive information such as your credit card and other 
                        financial information. <br>
