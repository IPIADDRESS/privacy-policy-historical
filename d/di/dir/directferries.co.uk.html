                    We endeavour to collect and use your personal information
                    only with your knowledge and consent and typically when
                    you order and subsequently use products and services,

                    questionnaires or surveys).<br>
                    <br>
                    The type of personal information we may collect could
                    include, for example, your name and postal address, date
                    of birth, gender, telephone and fax numbers, email address,
                    and credit/debit card information; lifestyle and other
                    information collected on registration or through surveys.
                    If you choose to provide us with personal information
                    it will be used in support of the intended purposes stated
                    at the time at which it was collected, and subject to

                    Non-personally identifying information</b><br>
                    <br>
                    We may also collect non-personally identifying information
                    about your visit to our web sites based on your browsing
                    (click-stream) activities. This information may include
                    the pages you browse and products and services viewed
                    or ordered for example. This helps us to better manage
                    and develop our sites, to provide you with a more enjoyable,
                    customised service and experience in the future, and to
                    help us develop and deliver better products and services
                    tailored to your individual interests and needs. <br>

                    How will we use your information? </b><br>
                    <br>
                    We may use your information for a number of purposes which
                    includes: processing your orders and managing and administering
                    your account; delivering any services, products or information
                    requested by you; responding to complaints or account
                    enquiries; administering debt recoveries; verifying your
                    identity when required (you may lose your password or
                    security information for example, and we may then need
                    to ask you for other 'identifiable' information to protect
                    your data from unauthorised access).<br>
                    <br>
                    We may also undertake market and product analysis based
                    on your use of our services and products and contact you
                    with information about new developments, products, services
                    and special offers by post, telephone, Email, Fax, and
                    the world wide web (subject to any preferences expressed
                    by you). <br>
                    <br>
                    We may also tell you about the products and services of
                    carefully selected third parties and allow you to receive
                    advertising and marketing information from those selected
                    third parties without passing control of your personal
                    information to the third party. For example we may send
                    you information with your ticket, or you may simply receive
                    an advertisement via email according to any preferences
                    indicated by you and/or according to your interests. This
                    helps us to make you aware of products and services that
                    we may have specially negotiated for our own customers
                    and which may be of individual interest to you. <br>
                    <br>
                    You acknowledge that by providing data to us, you consent
                    to the processing of your data in accordance with this
                    Privacy Policy Statement. However, you can contact us
                    at anytime to have your details removed from lists used
                    by us for direct marketing purposes, to update your information
                    or to otherwise tell us how you would like to receive
                    information about our and/or third party products and
                    services - the choice is yours. <br>

                    When will we disclose your information to others? </b><br>
                    <br>
                    We may disclose information about you, your account and
                    booking history to (i) companies within Direct Ferries
                    Ltd for the purposes and subject to the terms of this
                    Privacy Policy Statement; and (ii) in the event that we
                    undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third party,
                    in which case you agree that any personal information
                    we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised
                    entity or third party for the purposes and subject to
                    the terms of this Privacy Policy Statement. <br>
                    <br>
                    Please note that Direct Ferries does not sell or pass
                    your personal information to third parties (other than
                    as set out in the paragraph above) unless you have given
                    us permission or unless it is necessary to deliver the
                    products and services ordered or used by you. For example,
                    we may disclose your data to a credit card company to
                    validate your credit card details and obtain payment when
                    you buy a product or service. It may also be necessary
                    to pass your data to the organisation from whom you have
                    ordered any products or services. <br>
                    <br>
                    Direct Ferries may also be obliged to disclose your personal
                    information to meet any legal or regulatory requirements
                    or obligations in accordance with applicable law. <br>

                    us recognise you on subsequent visits so that you don't
                    have to re-enter your registration details each time you

                    <br>
                    Direct Ferries recognises that its customers are increasingly
                    concerned about how companies protect personal information
                    from misuse and abuse and about privacy in general. Direct
                    Ferries is constantly reviewing and enhancing its technical,
                    physical and managerial procedures and rules to protect
                    your personal data from unauthorised access, accidental
                    loss and/or destruction. We use industry standard secure
                    sockets layer (SSL) technology, for example, to encrypt
                    sensitive information such as your credit card and other
