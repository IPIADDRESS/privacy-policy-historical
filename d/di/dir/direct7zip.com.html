If any such contractors and agents have access to personally identifiable information, we require them to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. Additionally, you should be aware that our own personnel may occasionally have access and be exposed to random information, some of which may be Your Fusion Installer Information, as it goes through the Fusion Installer servers.

<p>Fusion Installer has established safeguards and maintains strict protocols to help prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of Your Fusion Installer Information.

<h2>General Internet Hazards </h2>

<p>Any time you receive files over the Internet from third parties, regardless of the application used, whether Fusion Installer, email or other application, you may be subjecting yourself to receiving harmful files or files that are not compatible with your operating system. Prior to accepting any files from any Internet user, including those from an account that appears familiar to you, we highly recommend verifying that the person sending you such files is the person you believe he or she is. You should be extremely careful about accepting files from users you do not trust, from users you do not know, or from users whose identity you have not been able to confirm. You should also be aware that communications sent over the Internet are not secure unless they are encrypted. Fusion Installer does not encrypt your communications through the Services. Further, your communications made through Fusion Installer may be routed through different countries which may have different laws, rules, regulations and standards regarding activities on the Internet.
