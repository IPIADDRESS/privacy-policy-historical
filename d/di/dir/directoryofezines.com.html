OUR PRIVACY POLICY</p>

<p>DirectoryOfEzines.com is committed to protecting the privacy
of our online visitors.</p>

<p>We collect information from online visitors who ask to be on

announcements.</p>

<p>Anyone who wishes can choose to be removed from our mailing
list at any time.</p>

<p>In addition, online visitors who wish to purchase a
membership through our Web site must provide their name, email
address, mailing address, phone number, and credit card number
and expiration date. All credit card transactions occur over a
secure connection.</p>

<p>We do not store credit card numbers on our servers and use
third party services for payment processing and shopping cart
services.</p>

<p>All online visitor data collected by DirectoryOfEzines.com

<p align="center">Children's Privacy</p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from
children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal
information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that
information from our systems. DirectoryOfEzines.com encourages
parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to
help make a child's online experience safer:</p>

<p>Teach kids never to give personal information, unless
supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Includes name,
address, phone, school, etc.</p>

<p>Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are
appropriate.</p>

<p>Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's
information is treated.</p>

<p>Check out the FTC's site</p>
