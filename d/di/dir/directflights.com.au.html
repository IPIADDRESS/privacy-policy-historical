          <p>Direct Flights International considers your personal information to be of vital importance. We are committed to respecting your privacy.</p>
          
          <p>In general, you can visit Direct Flights International website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. </p>
          
          <p>However there are times when we may need information from you such as when you register for fares or to receive information from us. This information may include your name, home or business address, CRS subscribers and e-mail address. Direct Flights International will seek to let you know before we collect any personal information from you over the Internet. Direct Flights International may share the information obtained with other organisations with a similar purpose to our own, such as state tourist authorities, tour operators and airlines. We will endeavor to limit the use of the information to the purpose for which it was provided.</p>
          
          <p>No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect server logs. The statistics and log files may be preserved indefinitely and used at any time and in any way necessary to prevent security breaches and to ensure the integrity of the information supplied by Direct Flights International.</p>
          
          <p>On Direct Flights International websites, IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) are logged to track a user's session while the user remains anonymous. We analyse this data for certain trends and statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there. In general, we do not link your IP addresses to anything personally identifiable to you. </p>
          
          <p>When Direct Flights International receives information about you, we may also use it for research or to improve our site and the services we offer you.</p>
          
          <p><span class="txhd">COOKIES</span><br>

Cookies can make your subsequent visits to the web page simpler and more seamless. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (However, by not accepting cookies, some web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information.). A server cannot find out a name or e-mail address, or anything about a user's computer, by using cookies. Cookie information is not stored or collected by Direct Flights International.</p>
          
          <p><span class="txhd">SECURITY</span><br>
          Once Direct Flights receives information from you via e-mail or any other means, the information is in a secure environment. Your personal information will not be released unless the law permits it or your permission is granted.
