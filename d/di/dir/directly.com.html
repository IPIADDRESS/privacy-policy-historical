<h1 id="purpose" class="teal-text">1. Introduction</h1>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>1.1. Directly Service.</strong> Welcome to our website, directly.com, and related marketplace platform, and related software, technology and services (collectively the “<strong>Services</strong>”) operated by Directly Software, Inc. (“<strong>Directly</strong>,” “we,” “our,” “us”). Directly provides the Services to deliver a better customer experience for our corporate enterprise customers (“<strong>Customers</strong>”). The Services combine and improve technologies for customer experience automation with empathy and expertise from people who register and qualify as end-user experts on the Services (“<strong>Experts</strong>”). Experts are eligible to accept routed requests to perform tasks via the Services as specified by the applicable Customer, including to resolve customer service questions (“<strong>Answers</strong>”), to train technology systems for automation (“<strong>Training</strong>”), and to update knowledge databases (“<strong>Knowledge Base</strong>”, collectively “<strong>Expert Content</strong>”).</p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>1.2. Purpose &amp; Scope.</strong> Privacy and security are important to Directly. The purpose of this privacy policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) is to inform you what information Directly processes through directly.com (including any subdomains) and the Services. The Privacy Policy details how we collect, use, and disclose different types of information or data, including personal data and your choices and rights. By “<strong>Personal Data</strong>” we mean any type of information or data that identifies, or reasonably could be used to identify, you as an individual. In some countries (for example, the European Economic Area countries or “EEA”), local legal systems have a specific definition of personal data, or in other jurisdictions, of “personally identifiable information” that will apply. Where this is the case, we refer to and will process any such data as “Personal Data.” We refer to information that does not fall under any applicable scope or definition of personal data as “<strong>Other Data</strong>” and to Personal Data and Other Data collectively as “<strong>Data</strong>.” All capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in our Terms. </p>
<p class="no-indent">By accessing directly.com or submitting Personal Data through the Services, you consent to the processing of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="no-indent">If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy or Terms, do not access or use directly.com, the Services, any other aspect of Directly’s business, and in such case, you should (a) take the necessary steps to remove cookies from your computer after leaving our website and/or Services (see Section 2.3 below), and (b) discontinue any future access or use. </p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>Our Services (including directly.com) are intended for adults and not for children:  Anyone under the age of 18 is not permitted to access or use directly.com or the Services.</strong> If you are under the age of 18 you are prohibited from registering for or using a Directly Account or submitting any Data to us.</p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong> 1.3. Scope of Application.</strong> The Privacy Policy applies to your access to and use of the Services, as either a visitor to directly.com or as an Expert. The Privacy Policy is a part of and incorporated into our Terms, which governs your use of the Services. It’s also important to note that the Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to the following:</p>
<p class="no-indent">First, the Privacy Policy <strong><em>does not</em></strong> apply to our Customers, whose license and access to the Services is governed by a separate legal agreement with Directly (each a “<strong>Customer Agreement</strong>”). Second, the Privacy Policy also doesn’t apply to a Customer’s end users who posts customer service questions independent websites, helpdesk systems, and customer service channels managed by each Customer. Third, the Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites or other digital properties, applications, services, products or software (“<strong>Third Party Services</strong>”) even if they link to or from directly.com or the Services, or any other third-party products, services or businesses such as our Customers (as described below). Accordingly, in each of these circumstances you should review the privacy practices of those independent third-parties carefully. </p>
</section>



<section class="legal-content">
<h1 id="data" class="teal-text">2. Data Collected</h1>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>2.1. Experts and Registration for a Directly Account.</strong> We collect Personal Data in different ways. You can visit Directly.com and certain subdomains without registering, but to become an authorized Expert eligible to respond to requests and submit Expert Content, you will need to create an account with Directly (“<strong>Directly Account</strong>”) and submit the following types of Personal Data: legal name, email address and/or mobile phone number, a personal “headshot” photo, physical mailing address, birthdate, verification phone number, and government identification (“<strong>Expert Registration Information</strong>”). Experts also have the option to create a user profile containing a description why they should be considered a “team expert,” as well as top skills and language abilities.  We use elements of the Expert Registration Information to verify your identity, combat fraud and keep our Services, Experts, Customers and partners secure. By registering for a Directly account, you authorize us and/or our Third-Party Providers to verify Registration Information, including your identity.</p>
<p class="no-indent">As described in our Terms, Directly or Customers may impose additional terms and duties for your eligibility (“<strong>Supplemental Terms</strong>”).&nbsp;You will be given an opportunity to review and consent to such Supplemental Terms.  For example, where a Customer or applicable data protection law requires special expert certification measures, and subject to your consent, Experts may be asked to provide additional Personal Data relating to professional background.</p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>2.2. Log and Usage Information.</strong> We also collect other types of Data, which may be construed as Personal Data in certain jurisdictions, including the following:  website usage information such as how you’ve used our Services, IP address, and other technical data such as browser type, unique device identifiers and information, language preference, referring site and the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information; approximate location data (from IP address); information regarding interactions with directly.com, such as comments, poll responses; and other information you may provide such as contact form submissions. </p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong> 2.3. Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes such as site visitation.  We use first party and third-party cookies for several different purposes. Some cookies are required for technical reasons to operate our Services.  Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Services.  For example, Directly uses first party cookies to keep track of the specific directly.com webpages or Services you visit to determine which are the most popular or most used.  Third parties serve third party cookies through our website for advertising, analytics and other purposes. These third parties may use information about your visits to directly.com and other websites to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. Information about cookies is available at <a href="https://www.aboutcookies.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.aboutcookies.org</a>. Many web browsers allow you to manage your preferences.  You can set your browser to refuse cookies or delete certain cookies.  You may be able to manage other technologies in the same way that you manage cookies using your browser’s preferences.  Please note that if you choose to block cookies, doing so may impair the Services or prevent certain elements of it from functioning.  On your mobile device, you may also have a “Limit Ad Tracking” setting (on iOS devices) or a setting to “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” (on Android), which allows you to limit the use of information about your use of apps for purposes of serving ads targeted to your interests.</p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>2.4. Data Collected by Third Parties.</strong> We also acquire Data and Personal Data that certain third-party providers (each a “Third-Party Provider”) collect from you to update or supplement the Data and Personal Data you provide, or we collect automatically.  If you access our Services from a Third-Party Provider in connection with services such as the Apple App Store, Google Play, Salesforce App Store, or another third-party app platform, you are subject to the privacy policies of the respective provider.  Our Services and associated technology also enable one or more Third-Party Providers of analytic services (e.g., Google Analytics) to collect this type of information (such as device identifiers) so we can analyze how our Services are used.  (We may also link with certain Third-Party Providers, such as Jumio, who link from our Service and collect personal data subject to its separate terms and privacy policy.)  All Data and Personal Data collected by Third-Party Providers are governed by the respective provider’s terms of service and privacy policy. </p>

</ul>
<p></p>

However, where Directly is required by mandatory law to retain your Personal Data longer, or where your Personal Data is required for Directly to assert or defend against legal claims, we will retain your Personal Data until the end of the relevant retention period or until the claims in question have been settled.

<section class="legal-content">
<h1 id="sharing" class="teal-text">4. Sharing and Disclosure</h1>
<p class="no-indent"><strong> 4.1. General.</strong> Directly does not sell or rent Personal Data to marketers or unaffiliated third parties.  Generally, we will share Personal Data collected by Directly with Third-Party Providers only in limited circumstances, including:  (i) with your consent; (ii) to an authorized Third-Party Provider who meets our data protection standards; or (iii) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process, or to enforce our Terms.</p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>4.2. Third-Party Providers.</strong>  We share data with certain Third-Party Providers who help us provide the Services.  For example, certain Third-Party Providers help us with such activities as web-hosting and data analysis.  Currently, we use Amazon, for hardware, software, networking, and storage services which are necessary to operate our Website and Services.  We also share Personal Data with Third-Party Providers, such as merchants (e.g., PayPal), application providers (e.g., Lessonly), and identity verification providers (e.g. Jumio) as necessary to process payments, qualify Experts, and provide the Services.  Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, such Third-Party Providers are required not to use Personal Data other than to provide the specific services specified under written contract by Directly and for no other purposes.  Subject to the foregoing, you expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Data and Other Data with these Third-Party Providers for these limited purposes.</p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>4.3. Third Party Acquirer.</strong> If we merge with another company such that your Personal Data and Other Data will become subject to a materially different privacy policy, we’ll notify you before the transfer.  You can opt out of any new policy by deleting your account during the notice period. </p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>4.4. Experts.</strong> We disclose certain limited content of each request for Answers (e.g., non-personally identifiable usernames or first names of Experts).  We also share Other Data with Experts about their responses to Answers and the generation of Expert Content.</p>

Customer Users.</strong> We disclose the content of the responses to Answers (including the first name of the Expert who responded) to the Customer who generated the request for Answers (and to any subsequent Customer end users that pose a similar request).

<section class="legal-content">
<h1 id="choices" class="teal-text">5. Choices and Rights </h1>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>5.1.  Opt-Out Choices.</strong>  You have choices and access rights regarding our use and disclosure of your Personal Data.  If you no longer want to receive marketing-related emails from us going forward, you may opt-out via the unsubscribe link included in such emails.  If you wish to access, amend or delete any Personal Data we hold about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any Personal Data that we hold about you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@directly.com">privacy@directly.com</a>.  If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Directly Account Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period of time, but we may need to retain some of your Personal Data in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where we have a legitimate reason for doing so.  If your Personal Data changes, or if you no longer desire our Services, you may update it or deactivate your Directly Account by making the change in your account page, by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:hello@directly.com">hello@directly.com</a>, or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.

If you have already registered an account, you can find out how to terminate or cancel your account, or correct, or delete your Data by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@directly.com">privacy@directly.com</a>. </p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>5.2. Access Rights.</strong>  Individuals located in certain countries, such as the European Union or EEA, have certain statutory rights in relation to their Personal Data.  Please read section 7.5 below carefully so you understand all your rights and how to exercise them. </p>
</section>



<section class="legal-content">
<h1 id="security" class="teal-text">6. Security</h1>
<p class="no-indent">The security of your Personal Data is important to us.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p>
<p class="no-indent">We urge you to take steps to keep your Personal Data safe (including your account password), and to log-out of your account after use.  If your Directly Account is hacked, this may lead to unauthorized access, so be careful to keep your account data secure.  You use our Website and Services at your own risk, and you’re responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account (like using a strong password).
</p>
</section>



<section class="legal-content">
<h1 id="european" class="teal-text">7. Important Information for European Users</h1>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>7.1. Data Export and Processing.</strong> Our Services (including directly.com) are accessible globally.  We store and process Personal Data on servers located in the United States and we may transfer Personal Data (as defined under applicable law) to countries outside of your country of residence, which may have data protection laws that are different from those of the country where you reside.  However, we will take measures to ensure that any such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your Personal Data remains protected to the standards described in this Privacy Policy.  By using Services, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your Personal Data in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law. </p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>7.2. Safeguards for Exports from EEA.</strong>  If you are located in the EEA or Switzerland, we comply with applicable laws to provide an adequate level of data protection for the transfer of Personal Data.  Directly is certified under the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.  For more, see Directly’s Privacy Shield Policy.  You agree that Directly may transfer your Personal Data to countries other than the one in which you live.  We deploy the following safeguards when Directly transfers Personal Data originating from the European Union or Switzerland to other countries not deemed adequate under applicable data protection law: </p>
<p></p><ul class="legal-list" style="padding-left:60px">
<li><strong>E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield.</strong> To comply with European Union and Swiss data protection laws, Directly self-certified under <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield</a> and <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield</a>. These frameworks were developed to enable companies to comply with data protection requirements when transferring Personal Data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Program, please see <a href="http://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome</a>.</li>
<li><strong>European Union Model Clauses.</strong>  Directly offers European Union Model Clauses, also known as Standard Contractual Clauses, to meet the adequacy and security requirements for our Customers that operate in the European Union, and other international transfers of Personal Data.  A copy of our standard data processing addendum, incorporating the Model Clauses, is <a href="https://directly.com/legal/msa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available here</a>.</li></ul><p></p>
<p class="no-indent" style="margin-top:30px;"><strong>7.3. Legal Basis for Processing.</strong> If you are an individual residing in the EEA, we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the specific aspects of the Services you use and how you use them.  This means we collect and use your information only where:</p>
<p></p><ul class="legal-list" style="padding-left:60px">
<li>We need it to provide you with or operate the Services, including to provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services; </li>
<li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for anti-fraud protection or to protect our legal rights and interests;</li>
<li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or</li>
<li> We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p class="no-indent" style="margin-top:30px;">If you have consented to our use of your Personal Data for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.  Where we are using your Personal Data because we or a third party have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services or associated services.
</p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>7.4. Identifying Data Controller and Data Processor and Different GDPR Roles.</strong>  Data protection law in certain jurisdictions differentiates between the “controller” and “processor” of data.  It is important to note that Directly acts as both as a Data Controller and as a Data Processor within the realm of GDPR compliance: (a) As a <strong>Data Controller</strong>, Directly is responsible for safeguarding the data of our registered expert users as they interact directly with our marketplace platform and our visitors to directly.com; (b) As a <strong>Data Processor</strong>, Directly is responsible for safeguarding the data of our Customer’s end users as it flows through our marketplace platform.</p>
<p class="no-indent">Each of Directly’s Customers is the controller of its end users’ personal data.  In this context Directly serves as the processor of such personal data under instructions from each controller.  Each Customer is also responsible for making sure that their respective Customer end user’s privacy rights are protected, including responding to data subject requests. Directly will respond to such data subject requests from Customers and Customer end users as a Data Processor; this means with respect to Personal Data of Customer end users, we must respond as a matter of law and contract through our Customer.  On the other hand, with respect to Experts, Directly serves as the controller of Expert Personal Data and will directly respond to data subject request rights from Experts.</p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>7.5. Access Rights.</strong> Individuals located in certain countries, including the European Economic Area, have certain statutory rights in relation to their personal data.

<p class="no-indent"><strong>How does Directly and its Services Operate?</strong>  As detailed in our Terms, Directly has entered into separate agreements with each Customer to govern the delivery, access and use of the Services including instructions for the processing of the personal data of their respective Customer end users.  Each Customer licenses Directly technology and configures their help desks to enable its Customer end users to post Tasks to the Services for routing to Experts. </p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>What Role does Directly serve in Data Protection?</strong>  It is important to note that Directly acts as both as a Data Controller and as a Data Processor within the realm of GDPR compliance:  As a Data Controller, Directly is responsible for safeguarding the data of our Experts as they interact directly with our marketplace platform and our visitors to directly.com.  As a Data Processor, Directly is responsible for safeguarding the data of our Customers Users as it flows through our marketplace platform. </p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>Who is my Data Controller?</strong> If you are a visitor to Directly.com or an Expert of the Services your Data Controller is Directly Software Inc., 333 Bryant Street, #250, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA.

<p class="no-indent"><strong>What does Directly collect and do with my Personal Data?</strong>  Directly will process your Personal Data as set out in this Privacy Policy.  The Data we collect depends on how You use our website and Services. Sometimes, we receive Data directly from you, such as when you create a Directly Account to register as Expert, complete a form, or send us an email.  Other times, we collect Data by recording interactions with our Website or Services.  The collection and use of Data from a variety of sources is essential to our ability to provide the Services – and to help keep it trustworthy and secure.  Further information about our use of your Data and Personal Data can be found in Section 2 below.</p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>Duration of processing of Personal Data.</strong>  Where Directly is processing and using your Personal Data as permitted by law or under your consent, we will store your Personal Data (i) only for as long as is required to fulfil the purposes set out below, (ii) until you object to Directly’s use of your Personal Data (where Directly has a legitimate interest in using your Personal Data), or (iii) until you withdraw your consent (where you consented to Directly using your Personal Data). However, where Directly is required by mandatory law to retain your Personal Data longer or where your Personal Data is required for Directly to assert or defend against legal claims, we will retain your Personal Data until the end of the relevant retention period or until the claims in question have been settled.

However, there are circumstances in which we cannot take action without certain Personal Data, for example, because this Personal Data is required to process your registration or provide you with access to our Services.  In these cases, we cannot provide you with what you request without the relevant Personal Data. </p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>Where will my Personal Data be processed?</strong>  Directly is based and operates out of the United States.

See Section 7, “European Users,” above. </p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>Data subjects’ rights.</strong>  Data protection law in certain jurisdictions differentiates between the “controller” and “processor” of data.   Each Customer is the controller of its Customer end user’s Personal Data and in this context Directly serves as the processor of such personal data under instructions from each controller.  Each Customer is also responsible for making sure that their respective customers or end user’s privacy rights are protected, including responding to data subject requests. Directly will respond to such data subject requests from Customer end users as a processor which means that it will contact and follow the advice of the controller Customer with respect to such requests.  With respect to Personal Data of Experts, Directly serves as the controller of such data and will respond to data subject request rights.  <em>Please refer to Section 5 “Choices and Rights”</em>, above, for additional information on your rights.
