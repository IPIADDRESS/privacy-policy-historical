	<strong>Notice to California Residents - Your California Privacy Rights (As Provided by California Civil Code section 1798.83).</strong></p>
<p>
	California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses that share customer personal information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to such information-sharing. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose a customer's personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. As described in our Privacy Policy, you can opt-out of our sharing of your personal information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes by emailing hello@directly.com with words “opt-out” in the subject line. To find out more about your opt-out rights, please review our Privacy Policy or contact us by emailing hello@directly.com or writing Antony Brydon, Insidr, Inc., 333 Bryant Street, LL120, San Francisco, CA, 94107.

	We will only contact you with promotional, product usage and customer service emails if you opt-in by providing us with your email address. When you receive such emails from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further emails from us and you will have the opportunity to opt-out by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive.
