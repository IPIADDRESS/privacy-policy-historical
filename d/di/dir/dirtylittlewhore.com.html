    <p>
        Clips4sale.com(Website) has created this privacy policy ("Policy") in order to demonstrate our company's commitment to privacy. The following discloses our
        information gathering and disseminating practices. This Policy also instructs you on what procedures to take if you do not want to receive communications from
        us other than those required for account maintenance.
    </p>
    <h4 class="text-warning">Minors</h4>
    <p>
        Our company's services are directed to adults who possess validated credit card information, and are not marketed to individuals under the age of
        Eighteen(18)(21-years old where 18 is not the age of majority). Certain portions of Website, which may contain content considered offensive to some, are inaccessible
        to individuals under the age of Eighteen(18)(21-years old where 18 is not the age of majority)., as advocated by the Communications Decency Act. For those portions
        that may be accessible to individuals under the age of Eighteen(18), such as the Website home page and other areas presenting non-offensive content, the Website has
        no intention of collecting any personally identifiable information (that is, name, address, telephone number, or email address) from individuals under Eighteen(18)
        years of age(21-years old where 18 is not the age of majority).
    </p>
    <h4 class="text-warning">PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN(18) &amp; or (21) SHOULD NOT SUBMIT INFORMATION TO THE WEBSITE</h4>
    <p>

    </p>         
    <h4 class="text-warning">PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h4>
    <p>
        We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer the Website. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad
        demographic information. Our site may require Members &amp; Studios to give us contact information (such as email addresses and phone numbers), financial information
        (this includes account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (this includes zip code, age and income level). We use contact information to send the
        user information needed to maintain their studio &amp; or membership account, to contact them when necessary, and to notify them of news about our company. We also use
        customer contact information to send the user promotional material from some of our partners. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (other than those
        required for account administration); see the opt-out section below. The financial information collected is used to check the users' qualifications and to bill the

        offers is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information
        such as phone numbers and address. This information may be used to award gifts and promotional products.
    </p>

        of our users and/or any third parties.
