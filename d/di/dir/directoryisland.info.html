<a href="http://DirectoryIsland.info">http://DirectoryIsland.info</a> is absolutely committed to 
protecting the privacy of our online visitors. </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="3">We collect basic information from online visitors who ask to be on our
newsletter mailing list and/or receive periodic email announcements. Anyone who
wishes can choose to be removed from our mailing list at any time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">You will deal with our automated emailer, not a 
salesperson. We will NEVER hard sell. Unless you specifically ask 
for a live person to respond, all emails will be from a computer. I 
understand that many people wish to remain anonymous... and not be haggled with. I understand that you do NOT want a hype-spewing salesperson contacting you and 
talking down to you.</font></p>
