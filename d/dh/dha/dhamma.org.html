	<h1 class="www-h1">Privacy Policy</h1>
	<hr class="www-thinrule">
	<p class="www-left">
	  Thank you for visiting the Vipassana Meditation Website.
	  Your privacy is important to our organizations. To better
	  protect your privacy, we provide this notice telling you
	  about our information practices and the things you should
	  be aware of about how your information is collected and
	  used both at this site and in general by our many affiliated
	  organizations around the world. However, please note that
	  the specific details of the privacy policies of our
	  affiliated organizations around the world may differ from
	  country to country. A copy of the particular privacy policy
	  applicable to your information may be obtained from the
	  Vipassana course registrar or at the Vipassana course site
	  upon your arrival.
	</p>
	<h3 class="www-h3">The Information We Collect</h3>
	<p class="www-left">
	  If you choose to register for a Vipassana meditation course
	  via our on-line or conventional registration application,
	  the types of personally identifiable information that may
	  be collected include: name, address, e-mail address,
	  telephone number, fax number, and all the other highly
	  personal information that is called for on the application
	  form and on the course registration form. Your personal
	  information contained in your course application and
	  registration forms are stored in a secure manner within
	  our facilities and the only persons having access thereto
	  are those who have a specific "need to know", such as the
	  course registrar, the center/course manager and the
	  assistant teacher(s) conducting the course(s) to which you
	  seek admission.
	</p>
	<p class="www-left">
	  If you choose to utilize our "Tell A Friend About Vipassana"
	  service you necessarily submit both yours and another
	  person's e-mail address to send an electronic greeting and
	  the address of our website to that other person. The types
	  of personally identifiable information that may be collected
	  about you by that service is your email address and the types
	  of personally identifiable information that may be collected
	  about the other people at these pages includes the
	  recipient's email address. We also may collect certain
	  non-personally identifiable information when you visit our
	  website pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g.,
	  Firefox, Netscape, Opera or Internet Explorer), the type of
	  operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows, Mac OS or
	  Linux) and the domain name of your Internet service provider
	  (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).
	</p>
	<h3 class="www-h3">How We Use Your Information</h3>
	<p class="www-left">
	  We use the information you provide about yourself in your
	  application and registration forms to evaluate your
	  application for admission to a course and to register you
	  for that course. In addition, we have found that people who
	  attend a Vipassana course frequently attend subsequent
	  courses over their lifetime. In order to facilitate
	  subsequent attendance at courses and to maintain a record
	  of a studentâ€™s history and experience we may maintain
	  the course data of each student indefinitely in the absence
	  of a legal prohibition to do so in certain jurisdictions or
	  a request by a student to destroy his or her data. In some
	  cases we may use your name postal address and/or email
	  address to send you information about Vipassana related
	  activities and facilities, if you have not opted-out of
	  such contact. We use the information that you provide
	  about others in our "Tell a Friend" service to enable us
	  to send them your greeting and our website address. We
	  sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information
	  that we collect to improve the design and content of our
	  site and to enable us to understand who is accessing our
	  site from which locations and which files they are accessing
	  within the site, i.e., to use this information in the
	  aggregate to analyze site usage.
	  <span style="font-weight: bold">
	    This Vipassana Website does not ever make your personally
	    identifiable information available to third parties, for
	    commercial or any other reason. However, certain
	    regional websites of our organization may accept credit
	    card based donations and, in which case, personal
	    information related to those donation financial
	    transactions is processed in the usually manner.
	  </span>
	  Otherwise, we do not disclose your personal information
	  outside of the facilities of our affiliated organizations
	  and their common infrastructure except when required to do
	  so by law, for example, in response to a court order or
	  subpoena. We may also disclose such information in
	  response to a law enforcement agency's request or other
	  legal requirement.
	</p>
	<p class="www-left">
	  All teachers and assistant teachers of Vipassana as well
	  as all meditation center staff and Dhamma workers only
	  have access to your information submitted on the course
	  application and registration forms on a "need to know"
	  basis. Such information is maintained in confidence and
	  safeguarded against disclosure to or access by third
	  parties once it reaches the center or the non-center
	  course registrar to which it is submitted. However, the
	  particular manner in which your information is
	  maintained, stored and used is governed by the particular
	  privacy policy applicable within the country where the
	  particular course for which you are registering is being
	  held. The only risk of inadvertent disclosure of your
	  information can be in the case of applications submitted
	  by email and that is while the information is being sent
	  over the open internet, as under some circumstances our
	  email application facilities are not secure. Please do
	  not use the email application facility on this website
	  unless you are prepared to personally take this risk.
	</p>
	<p class="www-left">
	  Our application forms and the personal data contained
	  therein are handled by storage and processing on
	  computers. In addition, our computers are located in
	  various countries of the world. Your submission of an
	  application form to attend one of our courses constitutes
	  your unequivocal consent to the storage and processing
	  of your application data on a computer and to the
	  cross-border transfer of your personal information
	  contained in the application form. For the welfare of
	  the students, it may be necessary for us to take and
	  retain notes on any health concern or behavior in
	  relation to the course that is inconsistent with the Code
	  of Discipline or that otherwise indicates that a student
	  should be restricted from attending future courses or will
	  need additional support during a future course. In the rare
	  event of this occurring, these notes will be entered on a
	  computer and shared in confidence with assistant teachers
	  and authorized course registrars involved in future courses.
	  Your attendance at a course will constitute unequivocal
	  consent to the handling of such notes and the cross-border
	  transfer thereof.
	</p>
	<h3 class="www-h3">Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites</h3>
	<p class="www-left">
	  This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and
	  dissemination of information that we collect from you.
	  Our website may contain links to other sites whose
	  information practices may be different than ours. Visitors
	  should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have
	  no control over information that is submitted to, or
	  collected by, these third parties. Since our Vipassana
	  organizations do not control the privacy policies of
	  third parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and
	  policies, if any, of that third party, and our vipassana
	  organizations shall not be responsible for the use or
	  dissemination of your personal information by that third
	  party. Therefore, we encourage you to ask questions before
	  you disclose your personal information to others.
	</p>
	<h3 class="www-h3">Cookies</h3>
	<p class="www-left">
	  The Vipassana Website does not have any webpages that use
	  "cookies." Cookies are text files that are placed in your
	  computer's browser to store your preferences. Some other
	  "regional" Vipassana websites may use cookies.
	</p>
	<h3 class="www-h3">Children's Privacy</h3>
	<p class="www-left">
	  Our Vipassana organizations do not specifically collect
	  information about children, but we are concerned about the
	  safety of children and their use of the Internet.
	  Therefore, in accordance with the U.S. Children's Online
	  Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (and comparable legislation
	  of other countries), we will never knowingly request or
	  solicit personally identifiable information from anyone
	  under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent.
	  In the event we receive actual knowledge that we have
	  collected such personal information without the requisite
	  and verifiable parental consent, we will delete that
	  information from our database as quickly as is practical.
	</p>
	<h3 class="www-h3">Country Specific Privacy Requirements</h3>
	<p class="www-left">
	  Please note that individual countries may have particular
	  privacy law requirements. Our Vipassana organizations
	  around the world have developed specific privacy policies
	  to comply with these requirements that may differ in
	  specific details from the more general policies set forth
	  above. You may obtain a hard copy of these specific
	  requirements by contacting the course registrar of the center
	  to which you have submitted your application and/or
	  registration forms or at the course site upon your arrival.
	</p>
	<h3 class="www-h3">Opt-Out/Opt-In</h3>
	<p class="www-left">
	  We provide you with the opportunity to "opt-out" of having
	  our Vipassana organizations send you e-mail or postal mail
	  about our services or other information related to Vipassana.
	  In other cases, it may be possible for you to "opt-in" to
	  certain local information distribution lists.  If you choose
	  to have your name, email address or other personally
	  identifiable information removed from our database, you can
	  do so by sending an e-mail to us at the following address:
	  <a href="mailto:database-remove@dhamma.org">database-remove@dhamma.org</a>.
	  You can also contact your local Vipassana Center or
	  organization and request removal.
	</p>
	<h3 class="www-h3">How to Contact Us</h3>
	<p class="www-left">
	  If you have any questions or concerns about the privacy
	  or any other policies of the Vipassana Website or its
	  implementation you may contact us at:
