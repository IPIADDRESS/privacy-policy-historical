<p style="padding-bottom:15px; line-height:22px;">Aside from the purposes described above, we will not share your personal information with any other third parties unless we have your express permission or there are special circumstances, such as when DHgate is required by the government, law enforcement body, obligee whose legitimate right has been injured, subpoena or other legal document to share such information, or if we believe it to be reasonably necessary to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect DHgate’s rights or property.

<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Minors</strong></p>
<p style="padding-bottom:15px; line-height:22px;">DHgate does not intentionally collect personal information about minors or other persons without full civil conduct capacity, but based on the properties of Internet, there is no way for DHgate and the Site to distinguish the age or capacity of the users. By accepting this Agreement through your use or access of the Site, you certify that you are a person over 18 years old with full capacity and ability to form a legally binding contract in the jurisdiction in which you are resident or in which you are entering into this Agreement. If you do not agree to (or cannot comply with) any of the terms of this Agreement, do not use the Site. </p>
<p style="padding-bottom:15px; line-height:22px;">Meanwhile, if a minor or other person does not have full civil conduct capacity and has provided personal information to us without the proper consent of their parent or legal guardian, such parent or legal guardian should contact us to remove such personal information.</p>
<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p style="padding-bottom:15px; line-height:22px;">Your information is stored on our servers located in the P.R.C, and we adopt lots of tools, means and technologies to protect them against unauthorized access, use and disclosure. For instance, we use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which encrypts (or encodes) sensitive information before it is sent over the Internet. However, we are limited in our efforts by the technologies currently available, and no data transmission or storage over Internet can be guaranteed to be perfectly safe. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your information and privacy, we do not promise or guarantee that your information will always be private and safe.</p>
<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>General</strong></p>
<p style="padding-bottom:15px; line-height:22px;">We realize that making purchases on the Site, or any other web site, requires trust on your part. We value your trust very highly and pledge to you, our clients, that we will work hard to protect the security and privacy of any personal information you provide to us and that your personal information will only be used as set forth in this Policy. This includes your name, address, phone number, email address or checking account information, in addition to any other personal information that can be linked to you, personally.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:15px; line-height:22px;">DHgate may provide links to certain third party web sites. This Security and Privacy Policy applies only to activities conducted and personal information collected on the Site. Other web sites may have their own policies regarding privacy and security. We encourage you to review the privacy policies on these sites before you use and access them. You are solely responsible for your use and access of other web sites.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:15px; line-height:22px;">DHgate will obtain your consent before allowing the download of any software from the Site, and DHgate will not automatically download any software to your computer system. Once you consent to the initial download of any software, you may receive automatic updates or patches pertaining to such software. You understand and agree that any material, including but not limited to downloaded software, required or automated updates, modifications, reinstallations, or software otherwise obtained through the use of the Site is done at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages to your computer system or loss of data that may result from any such material.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:15px; line-height:22px;">DHgate reserves the right to update or modify this Security and Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice to you.  The most current version of the Policy will govern DHgate’s use of the information and will always be at <a href="http://help.dhgate.com/help/buyer_about_usen.php?catpid=g4">http://help.dhgate.com/help/buyer_about_usen.php?catpid=g4</a>.  If DHgate makes a change that, in DHgate’s sole discretion, is material, DHgate will notify you via e-mail to the email address associated with your account.  Your use of the Site following any such change constitutes your unconditional agreement to follow and be bound by the Security and Privacy Policy as amended.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:15px; line-height:22px;">DHgate may transfer this Policy and all or part of its rights, obligations and interests to any party or entity in its sole discretion; however, a User may not assign its rights, obligations and interests under this Policy to any party or entity. </p>
