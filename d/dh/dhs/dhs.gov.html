									<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
								
						
					<p>Thanks for visiting the Department of Homeland Security website and reviewing our privacy policy! Our privacy policy is plain and simple.

<h3>Information Collected and Stored Automatically</h3>

<p>When you browse, read pages or download information on The Department of Homeland Security 's websites, we automatically gather and store certain technical information about your visit. This information never identifies who you are. The information we collect and store about your visit is listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website;</li>

<li>The type of browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) and operating system (Windows, Unix) used to access our site;</li>

<li>The date and time you access our site;</li>

<li>The pages you visit; and</li>

Department of Homeland Security cookies are stored in memory and are only available during an active browser session. Again, once you close your browser, the cookie disappears.</p>

<h3>If You Send Us Personal Information</h3>

<p>If you choose to provide us with personal information -- like filling out a Contact Us form with personal information and submitting it to us through the website -- we use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information you have requested. We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. We never create individual profiles or give it to any private organizations. The Department of Homeland Security never collects information for commercial marketing.</p>

<h3>Site Security</h3>
