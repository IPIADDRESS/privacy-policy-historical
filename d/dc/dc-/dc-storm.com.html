		<h5>Policy Statement</h5>
		<p>DCS collects and uses certain types of information about visitors to its web site in order to operate flexibly and provide a high level of service.</p>
		<p>This information is held and processed in accordance with the requirements of the UK Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
