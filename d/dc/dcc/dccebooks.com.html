		<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
		<p>
    <em>Non-Personal Information</em>
    . We may collect the domain name of your Internet service provider, usage statistics and other non-personal data about your visit to our site but this
    information is not linked to your personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Personal Information</em>
    . We collect personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that you submit to us such as your name, mailing address, email address,
    telephone number, fax number, credit card or other payment information, age, birthdate, login name, password, and place of worship. We may collect Personal
    Information from you when you visit our website, request information about our products or services, make purchases or request downloads or free materials,
    submit surveys, participate in sweepstakes or other contest entries, contact our customer service department (or other departments ), post to our bulletin
    boards, comments section, or chat areas, or otherwise submit information to us. We also collect aggregate information on what pages visitors access or
    visit using cookies and information volunteered by you, such as survey information and/or site registrations. We may also obtain information about you from
    other sources, such as companies that update and verify email and physical addresses, for the purpose of updating and enhancing our files. Access to
    certain areas of our site and certain functions, such as purchasing products, may be limited to those visitors who provide us with required Personal
    Information.
</p>
<p>
    Certain services or products we offer may be tailored to a specific denomination. As such, we may ask you to identify your place of worship. You will, of
    course, have the option to decline to provide this information; however, if it is required for a particular service or product, you will be unable to
    obtain that service or product if you decline to provide it.
</p>
<p>
    </p><h2>How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
    We may use the information we collect, including IP addresses, to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Develop, enforce and perform a purchase and sale contract of products you have purchased or downloaded from this website;
</li>
<li>
    Analyze trends and use of content on our site;
</li>
<li>
    Administer our site;
</li>
<li>
    Contact you in response to your contact;
</li>
<li>
    Provide order status or feedback request from you;
</li>
<li>
    Provide services or products or complete transactions that you request;
</li>
<li>
    Analyze and improve our site’s content and functionality for each visitor;
</li>
<li>
    Allow access to limited entry areas of the website;
</li>
<li>
    Track user movements and interaction with content on our site;
</li>
<li>
    Gather broad demographic information for use on an aggregated basis; and
</li>
<li>
    Notify visitors about updates to our website, Terms of Use; Privacy Policy, ministry, and product offerings.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you supply us with your postal address and opt in to receiving such information, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new
    products and services. Visitors who supply us with their telephone numbers and opt in to receiving calls may receive telephone contact from us with
    information regarding new products and services.
</p>
<p>
    Visitors who supply us with their email address may receive email from us with information regarding new products and services. We may also occasionally
    send an email on behalf of a partner ministry. Additionally, we may share Personal Information with our ministry and business partners to facilitate our
    provision of goods or services requested by the visitor and, if you opt in, we may share your Personal Information with affiliates, strategic partners,
    agents, third party marketers or other parties who are offering products or services that we believe may be of service or interest to you, or who may
    contact you with an offer or advertisement, or they may use such information for research or business purposes (such as analyzing usage data of our
    website), or other purposes as may be disclosed to you.
</p>
<p>
    </p><h2>Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
    To help us provide you with superior service, timely completion of purchases and returns, as well as accurate shipments, we may share certain information
    relating to you within the David C Cook corporate family of entities. We may also share certain Personal Information with strategic, co-branded, or joint
    partners and with third party processors and vendors, as necessary, to process your orders or requests and otherwise administer the account (however, we
    will only share credit or debit card information as required to effectively process your credit or debit card payment), or to analyze trends and use of our
    website. These entities help us provide many important services to you, such as extending credit, fulfilling and shipping orders, providing customer
    service and performing customer satisfaction surveys. We also may share information with third parties to verify information collected from you in order to
    protect against potential fraud, and we may receive Personal Information about you from these parties. Your election to opt-out of the data sharing in the
    section entitled “How to Opt Out of Future Communications” is not an opt-out for the data sharing described in this paragraph.
</p>
<p>
    On occasion, we may be (or have a good faith belief that we are) required by law or litigation to disclose Personal Information pertaining to you. We may
    also disclose such information if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance or safety, disclosure is
    necessary. At times, we may share Personal Information in aggregate, anonymized so that no one individual can be identified.
</p>
<p>
    We may also transfer Personal Information to a third party as a result of a sale or acquisition, merger, or bankruptcy involving us.
</p>
<p>
    If you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information, we may transfer that information to our affiliates and subsidiaries or to other third
    parties, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are visiting from the European
    Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personally
    identifiable information to the United States which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and by providing your personally identifiable
    information you consent to (a) the use of your personally identifiable information for the uses identified above in accordance with this Privacy Policy;
    and (b) the transfer of your personally identifiable information to the United States as indicated above.
</p>
<p>
    </p><h2>Independent Contractors </h2>
<p></p>
<p>
    From time to time, we may use certain independent contractors and other third parties to operate components of our site, fulfill orders, or assist us in
    operating or improving our site. In this capacity, we may allow these independent contractors and third parties to collect the information described in
    this Privacy Policy for us.
</p>
<p>
    </p><h2>How to Opt Out of Future Communications</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
    If you would like to opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us or our partners in the future, please let us know by visiting us at
    www.davidccook.com/unsubscribe.cfm. (Unsubscribe links are also included at the bottom of marketing and promotional emails.) Please note: unsubscribing
    from marketing and promotional communications will not prevent us from sending you communications about items, products, or services that you have
    previously purchased (such as information about product upgrades or recalls) or to inform you about other issues relating to our existing relationship with
    you, including but not limited to, confirming an order, updating you on order status, and informing you about changes to this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    </p><h2>Accessing or Correcting Your Information</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
    Upon request we provide site visitors with access to all Personal Information, including proprietary information, which we maintain about them. Visitors
    can access this information through their account, if applicable, or by sending an email to us at the above address. In order to allow access to or change
    any Personal Information or in order to respond to a request from you to delete your Personal Information, we may require additional information to confirm
    the identity of the visitor requesting access or an amendment.
</p>
<p>
    </p><h2>Cookies</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
    “Cookies” are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser. They enable our systems to recognize you
    through your browser, when you log on, and to provide you certain personalized features, including the storage of items in your shopping cart in between
    visits.
</p>
<p>
    Like most other companies that engage in online commerce, we use “cookies” and other technologies to identify which parts of our website are the most
    popular, how easily our website is navigated, and how much time our customers spend in each section. This is standard practice with many similar companies,
    and it helps us structure our website to meet your unique needs and make our website more friendly. Among other uses, cookies also help us customize your
    experience with us, by enabling us to remember what products you may have looked at previously, identify who you are so that we can customize a greeting
    for you, and so we can personalize our other, sometimes unrelated, interactions with you. You may, of course, choose to disable the cookies, but, if you
    do, certain functions or areas of our website will become unavailable to you as a result.
</p>
<p>
    Some of our email or electronic communications to you may include a “click-through URL” linked to a particular page on our website. By clicking on one of
    these URLs, you will automatically enter our website. Our systems track this information to gauge the effectiveness of our email communications and your
    level of interest in particular areas. You may avoid having this information collected by avoiding clicking on URL links in our communications. Please
    note, that we will NEVER send you an email with an embedded link that asks for your password or any financial or account information; passwords are for
    your protection. If you EVER receive such an email, please contact us immediately using the contact information provided above.
</p>
<p>
    We also use pixel tags to identify what pages of our website are visited most frequently and to evaluate the effectiveness of the search functions on our
    website.
</p>
<p>
    </p><h2>Do Not Track</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
    This website does not respond to Do Not Track signals.
</p>
<p>
    </p><h2>Ad Servers</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
    We may have relationships with ad server companies. If you click on those ads, you may be taken to a third party website. We have no responsibility for or
    control over the content of any third party sites, the third party ads provided on our site, or the privacy policies that control third party sites and
    ads. You click on those ads at your own risk.
</p>
<p>
    </p><h2>Security</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
    When we transfer and receive certain types of financial information such as credit card numbers during the order checkout process, we redirect visitors to
    a secure server. David C Cook follows Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards in the handling of your credit card information.
</p>
<p>
    We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all website pages where Personal Information appears or is collected. If you wish to make a purchase from
    our website, you must use an SSL-enabled browser (for example, Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Safari). We use 128 bit encryption in our SSL sessions to
    protect personal customer information, including credit card information transmitted to our website for making purchases.
</p>
<p>
    For David C Cook website to which you have an account login and password, you can help us protect your Personal Information by keeping your account
    password confidential at all times and by not sharing it with any other person. You should also change your password frequently and be sure to use a
    combination of letters and numbers.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your information and cannot assume
    liability for improper access to it. By using any service we provide, including our website and user interfaces, or providing information to us through any
    means, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of any such
    service or our website.
</p>
<p>
    </p><h2>Information You Make Publicly Available</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
    You should be aware that information (including your name, email address, address, or phone number) provided by you in a posting on the website or any
    public page, bulletin board or social media site or function is available (even after you stop participating on the website) to any other individual who
    has access to that same website and may be used by another individual in a manner unintended by you, including as a target for unsolicited communications.
    You should therefore treat any information provided by you in the content of a submission or post to the website as public information. For this reason, we
    urge you to act cautiously in providing any such information in your submissions or posts, as we are not liable for any use or misuse by an individual user
    of the information you provide in a submission or post.
</p>
<p>
    </p><h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
    Our site is not directed to children under the age of 13 and David C Cook does not knowingly collect or maintain information on children under the age of
    13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit Personal Information to us. If you are the parent or guardian of a child age 13 or under who has
    provided us with Personal Information and you would like that information removed, please contact us at the address or email address provided above.
</p>
<p>
    </p><h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
    David C Cook reserves the right to change the content of its website and of this Privacy Policy at any time and at its sole discretion. For example, from
    time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not disclosed in our previous Privacy Policy notices. We will provide notice of
    changes to our Privacy Policy, but please check these policies frequently for changes. A visitor is bound by any changes to the policy when you visit or
    use our site after those changes have been posted. Unless stated otherwise, these policies apply to any information provided by you and stored in our
    records.
</p>
<p>
    </p><h2>Visitors From Outside of the United States</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to all visitors in the United States and to visitors from outside the United States to the extent allowed by applicable law.
    This site and the servers upon which it is hosted are located in the United States. All matters and material related to this site are governed by the laws
    of the State of Colorado in the United States. Any personal data that visitors outside of the United States provide via this site will be transferred to
    the United States, and by visiting this site and submitting personal data, you authorize this transfer and submit to Colorado jurisdiction.

<p></p>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy applies only to this website. Other websites we own and websites owned or operated by third parties may contain different privacy
    policies and practices. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other person, entity, organization, or website to or from which the website links or is
    linked. Visitors are strongly encouraged to read and regularly review posted privacy policies on all websites, whether or not owned by us or affiliated
    with the site.
</p>

    indications of the individual who posted it.
</p>
<p>
