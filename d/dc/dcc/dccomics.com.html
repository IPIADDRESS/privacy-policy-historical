<h3>Updated: November 9, 2010</h3>
<p>Thank you for visiting DCCOMICS.COM (the "Site"), a Time Warner site. Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the collection and use of the personal information you submit on Web pages where this policy is posted.</p>
<p>Please note that other Time Warner sites, including <a href="http://www.dckids.com">www.dckids.com</a>, operate under their own strict privacy and security policies.</p>

<h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
<p>On some pages of the Site, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.</p>
<p>On some pages of the Site, you might (now or in the future) be able to submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.</p>
<p>At certain parts of the Site, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the Site's activities and offerings.</p>
<p>We also collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our Web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows XP, Mac OS), and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).</p>

<h3>How We Use The Information</h3>
<p>We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>We use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.</p>
<p>We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards. From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs, or services to them.</p>
<p>The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services.</p>
<p>We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of the Site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze Site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.</p>
<p>We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer information about you if we or one of our business units are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company.</p>
<p>Agents and contractors of Time Warner who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Time Warner.</p>
<p>Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>At some places on the Site, we may ask your permission to disclose personally identifiable information about you to companies whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases and non-profit organizations) that want to market products or services to you. If at some point you grant us permission to transfer your information for these purposes and later decide that you no longer want us to do so, simply log into your profile if you have created an account with us, or send us an email at dconline@dccomics.com, and we will edit your preferences accordingly.</p>
<p>We may, on occasion, combine information we receive online with outside records to enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive marketing information from the Site, please simply send an email to dconline@dccomics.com with the word "unsubscribe" anywhere in the subject heading or in the body of the email.</p>
<p>Finally, we will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.</p>

<h3>Collection Of Information By Third-Party Sites And Sponsors</h3>
<p>Some of our pages contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy policies before submitting any information, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>
<p>We sometimes may offer content or programs (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that are sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the Site activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information. We will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.</p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Our privacy policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from you.</p>

<h3>Cookies And Other Technical Information</h3>
<p>We, our third party service providers, and our partners may send "cookies" to your computer or use similar technologies to enhance your online experience at the Site and across the Internet. "Cookies" are files that can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical information (including click through and click stream data). Cookies manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Site.  Cookies can either be permanent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). We may also use "Web beacons" that monitor your use of the Site. Web beacons (or Web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a Web page for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the Web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the Web beacon appears, the time the page containing the Web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server.</p>
<p>When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail, Web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our e-mail.</p>
<p>On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if you choose to furnish personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies/Web beacons.</p>
<p>By accepting this Privacy Policy, you specifically agree to our use of cookies and Web beacons as described herein. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website. Additionally, by setting your Web browser to display HTML e-mails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some Web beacons. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. However, certain areas of the Site can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content.</p>

<h3>Our Commitment To Security</h3>
<p>We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.</p>

<h3>How You Can Access Or Correct Information</h3>
<p>To access the personally identifiable information that the Site has collected about you online from the pages on which this Privacy Policy is posted, to correct factual errors in such information, or to update your interests, preferences or other portions of your user profile, please log into your profile if you have created one with us or send an email to dconline@dccomics.com.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>

<h3>Additional Information Regarding Children's Privacy</h3>
<p>The Site you are visiting is one of the Time Warner general audience sites. For more information about our online privacy practices for children's sites, consult the privacy notice at the children's site in which you are interested.</p>

<h3>How To Contact Us</h3>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or its implementation you may write to us at DC Comics, 1700 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 (attention: DC Online) or email us at dconline@dccomics.com.</p>

<h3>International Transfer</h3>
<p>As we operate internationally, and many of our computer systems are currently based in the United States, your personal data will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union.  Other than as set out below, if you create a user account with the Site as a visitor from outside the United States, you consent to the collection and/or processing in the United States of your personally identifiable information, which includes the use of cookies as described above.</p>

<h3>Updates To This Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. We will notify you about material changes in the way we treat our personally identifiable information by placing a notice on the Site. We encourage you to periodically check back and review this policy so that you always will know what information we collect, how we use it, and to whom we disclose it.</p>
