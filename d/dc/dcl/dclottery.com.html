            WEBSITE PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY</h2>
        <p>
            The District of Columbia Lottery and Charitable Games Control Board ("D.C.
            Lottery") is committed to protecting the rights of all our visitors. We recognize
            our obligation to keep sensitive information secure and have created this privacy
            statement to share our information-gathering and dissemination practices for this
            website.</p>
        <h3>
            Collection and Use of Online Information</h3>
        <p>
            Our web server automatically collects your IP address when you visit our site. (Your
            IP address is your computer's unique address that lets other computers attached
            to the Internet know where to send data, but does not identify you individually.)
            We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to compile
            statistics on site usage. We do not make your IP address available to anyone outside
            the D.C. Lottery.</p>
        <p>
            To provide better service and a more effective website, sections of this site may
            use "cookies" as part of our interaction with your browser. A cookie is
            a small text file (typically only a few bytes) that we place on your hard drive
            to allow our server to identify your computer. Our cookies will not attempt to read
            any information on your hard drive, and we do not combine information collected
            through cookies with other personal information to determine your identity or your
            email address.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you visit certain areas of this site, you may be asked to provide personally
            identifiable information (such as name, address, telephone number, email address,
            etc.) that we need to process your request. In the event that you decline to provide
            such information, you limit our ability to serve you. Still, we invite you to continue
            to visit the site and take advantage of the wealth of information it offers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The D.C. Lottery may occasionally survey website users for their voluntary opinions
            on games or other matters of interest to lottery players, as well as for marketing
            and/or statistical analysis.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Secure Transmissions</h3>
        <p>
            Please be assured that this site has security measures in place to protect the information
            you provide us. We encrypt information that is deemed sensitive or data that must
            remain secure to meet legal requirements.</p>
        <h3>
            Protection of Personal Information</h3>
        <p>
            Your personal information is available only to D.C. Lottery employees who have a
            need to know it. It will not be available for public inspection without your consent.
            However, we may collect or disclose personal information if the collection or disclosure
            is: (1) necessary to perform the legal duties of the D.C. Lottery; (2) authorized
            by the District of Columbia Freedom of Information Act or other District of Columbia
            or federal statute or regulation; (3) made pursuant to&nbsp;a subpoena, court order
            or by law, (4) for the purposes of validating the identity of the user, or (5) used
            solely for statistical purposes in a form that can not be used to identify any particular
            person. Also, no site user information will be shared, sold, or transferred to any
            third party without your prior consent. Access is given only to those qualified
            professionals who provide D.C. Lottery services consistent with your interactions
            with our site.

            Right to Inspect, Amend, or Correct Personal Records</h3>
        <p>
            Every site user who provides us with personal information has the right to inspect,
            amend, or correct his or her own personal information. You may ask to inspect your
