<p><strong>Don Jagoda Associates, Inc. Privacy Policy</strong><br>
         <em>(AMENDED 4/7/2014)</em></p>
        <p>Don Jagoda Associates, Inc. ("We ",  "We", "Us") has created this policy in order to demonstrate our commitment to  privacy. This policy discloses our information gathering and dissemination  practices for this website, www.dja.com and for our company in serving our  clients. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of  your personal information and how you can access and update this information. </p>
        <p>We comply with the US-EU Safe Harbor  Framework and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department  of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal  information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.&nbsp; We have  certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice,  choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and  enforcement.&nbsp; To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our  certification page, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a></p>
        <p>As a full service promotion marketing  agency, we operate Sweepstakes, Contests and other promotions on behalf of our  clients. As part of those services, we receive, collect and process personally  identifiable information of consumers on behalf of our clients by use of both  online and offline technologies. Such uses may include notification of  potential winners and fulfillment of prizes. We strictly limit access to all  personally identifiable information within our company, and data is never  shared outside of the company for any reason whatsoever (except for our client,  appropriate governmental or legal requests). Personally identifiable  information collected by us on behalf of a client belongs solely to the client  and will be used solely in accordance with that particular client's Privacy  Policy. An individual's desire to "opt-out" of receiving marketing or other  information from a client will be handled in accordance with a particular  client's Privacy Policy and should be directed to that client or Sponsor of the  Promotion. </p>
        <p><strong>Information We Collect and Use</strong> <br>
          Visitors to our web site and the Promotion web sites built on  behalf of our clients have the option of giving us contact information and  other personally identifiable information, such as their name and email  address. This information is used by us to enter the visitor in a Promotion,  provide information, assess the needs of a business to determine suitable  products and select and contact potential winners and other site visitors via  phone, fax, email and regular mail.</p>
        <p>When we receive, collect and process consumers' personally  identifiable information on behalf of our clients when we administer their  promotions, we may also require sensitive information, such as social security  number or date of birth. Consumers provide this information in a variety of  methods, depending on the particular promotion. We only use this personally  identifiable information to operate the sweepstakes or other promotion for our  client, in order to select winners, award prizes or for other purposes of the  promotion. We do not use the information for any other purpose. We maintain the  information only for so long as necessary to verify and conduct the promotion  and to provide redundancy for our clients. We do not provide this information  to any entity other than our client and others involved in the operation of the  promotion. Our clients' privacy policies govern the use of these data and they  remain their property. Any exceptions to these procedures will be announced in  the promotion for which the change is made.</p>
        <p>It is our policy to retain client data, including personal data  necessary for the selection, notification and awarding of prizes in promotions  and any tax forms that are legally required to be completed for awarding those  prizes, for only as long as legally required or as requested by the client,  whichever is longer. No personal data is collected other than that required to  select, notify and award a prize winner per applicable law. All physical  documents are shredded and disposed of. All electronic data is deleted and  removed from all electronic devices including backups on a regular basis. All  requests from clients for data to be retained longer than legally required or  transferred to them or another vendor must be made in writing and in advance.</p>
        <p>We also collect certain information, not personally  identifiable, on our website and in connection with administration of  promotions. We&nbsp; may collect information  about your computer configuration such as your browser type, operating system,  or ISP domain name. We&nbsp; may collect  information about the site you last visited prior to the Promotion or about  your activity during your visit to the Promotion site. We&nbsp; may also offer social sign-on services that  allow you to register for a promotion using a third-party social networking  site such as Facebook, Instagram, Google or Twitter. By using these services  you allow us to access the available information from your third-party social  network profile such as your name, age, gender, location, email address and  list of friends. This information may be used by us to administer the technical  and operational aspects of the site, and may include using your IP address to  help diagnose problems with our server. Your IP address may also be used to  gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This enables us to  safeguard the promotion and diagnose problems in the operation of a promotion.<br>
          <br>
          We&nbsp;may also use cookies.  A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for  record-keeping purposes. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any  personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use both  session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you  close your browser. A session cookie might be used to track a user through a  multi-page registration process so they would not have to reenter information  multiple times during the registration process. A persistent cookie remains on  your hard drive for an extended period of time. For example, we may set a  persistent cookie for a day to prevent a user from returning to a site and  trying to enter a Sweepstakes more than once a day. You can remove persistent  cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help"  directory. Each browser has a function that enables the user to disable cookies  if so desired, but in that case, the participant may not be able to participate  fully in a promotion, and certain aspects of our site may be limited. We also  gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This  information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet  service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time  stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify  individual users, to analyze trends, track users' movements and to gather  demographic information about the user base of both our client's promotions and  our website. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally  identifiable information.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to our own methods of anonymous data collection, our  clients may use other types of tracking technologies. Unless otherwise stated,  the use of cookies and other tracking technologies by our clients for the  purpose of administering a promotion is not covered by our privacy policy. We do  not have access or control over these cookies.        </p>
        <p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights (California Civil Code Section  1798.83)</strong><br>
        A California resident who has provided personal information to a  business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal,  family, or household purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request  information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to  any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general,  if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon  receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to  provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed  in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal  information that were disclosed. However, under the law, a business is not  required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and  discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing  customer's personal information to third parties for their direct marketing  purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as  long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business  may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to  prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to  exercise that right.</p>
        <p><strong>Your Access and Choices Regarding Your Data</strong> <br>
          Upon request you may view and have inaccuracies corrected in  contact information or other personally identifiable information, by sending us  an e-mail to: <a href="mailto:info@dja.com">info@dja.com</a> with "Contact Correction" written in the subject line and the  correct information written in the body of the email, or you may mail us your  request to the address below. We will respond to your request to access within  30 days.<br>
          <br>
          If you have provided us with contact information or other  personally identifiable information and do not want to receive e-mail from us  in the future and wish to delete such information, please let us know by  sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@dja.com">info@dja.com</a> with "Remove from List" written in the subject line, or you may  mail us your request to the address below.<br>
          <br>
          When you provide personal information to us through our website,  we will retain your information as needed to provide you services and as  necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce  our agreements.</p>
        <p>In compliance with the US-EU and  US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about your  privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.&nbsp; European  Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy  policy should first contact us at:<br>
          <br>

          Melville, New York, USA&nbsp; 11747<br>
          Attn: Privacy Officer<br>
  <br>
          We have further committed to refer unresolved  privacy complaints under the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles to an  independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by  the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely  acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily  addressed by us, please visit the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR web site at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints">www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints</a>&nbsp;for more information and to  file a complaint. </p>
        <p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong><br>
        We abide by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act  ("COPPA"). We will not knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide to us, or to  any of our clients on their behalf, any personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p><strong>Sharing your Information with others</strong> <br>
        We will share your personal information with third parties only  in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your  personal information to third parties.</p>
        <p>We may provide your personal information to companies that  provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your  order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your  personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.<br>
          We may also disclose your personal information: as required by  law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; when we  believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights,  protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a  government request; to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.        </p>
        <p><strong>Security</strong> <br>
        The security of your personal information and our Client's  information is important to us. When sensitive information (such as a social security  number) is entered in our promotion and sweepstakes forms, we encrypt the  transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).&nbsp; We follow generally accepted standards to  protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and  once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of  electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its  absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site,  you can contact us at: <a href="mailto:info@dja.com">info@dja.com</a>        </p>
        <p><strong>Other Privacy Information</strong> <br>
          Our Site includes links to other Web sites and we may develop  Web sites on behalf of our Clients whose privacy practices may differ from  those of ours. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your  information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to  carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit.<br>
          <br>
          Our Web site also includes Social Media Features such as the Facebook  Like button. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are  visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function  properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party  or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are  governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<br>
          <br>
          Our Web site offers a publicly accessible blog. You should be  aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected,  and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal  information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@dja.com">info@dja.com</a> In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal  information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and  why.</p>
        <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong> <br>
          From time to time, we may use customer information for new,  unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our  information practices change at some time in the future we will contact you  before we use your data for these new purposes to notify you of the policy  change and to provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. The  changes will also be noted in revisions to this privacy policy.</p>
