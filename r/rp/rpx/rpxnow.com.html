<h1 class="main">RPX Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
Welcome to RPX, the simple, consistent, secure  authentication and data
portability service. We take your privacy seriously; therefore, below we
provide you with our privacy policy, where we intend to be transparent about
any information we collect, how we intend to use it to your benefit, and what
choices you have when you register with us and use RPX.
</p>

<h3>Here are our commitments</h3>
<p>
</p><ul style="margin-left:2em;">
  <li>Your privacy remains strictly under your control</li>
  <li>The privacy of state data from your end users remains strictly under your control</li>
  <li>You can end your account at any time</li>
  <li>We will never disclose your personally-identifiable information to any third party for marketing purposes unless you expressly tell us to </li>
  <li>You can decide whether you want to receive any offers from us that may be of interest to you</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3>Information Practices</h3>
<p>
When you register and use RPX, you provide information to us.  When the RPX
service is being used by your web site, additional state data is retained as a
result of authentication and data flow from provider. 
</p>
<p>
In the following three sections, we explain what information is collected, how it is used to
your benefit, and the choices that you have with your information.
</p>

<h3>Information Collected by RPX</h3>
<p>
 Depending on how you interact with RPX, you provide us with information, which
 may include: (a) site name, email address, and other registration information;
 (b) your interaction with RPX features and advertisements; (c)
 transaction-related information, such as, when you download software from us;
 and (d) information you provide us when you contact us for help. As part of
 your personal profile, you may choose to submit additional information. 
 </p>
 <p>
 State data is often collected from providers during the normal operation of the
 RPX service.  This data ranges in content and policy depending on nature of the
 endpoints.  This data is kept persistantly by RPX only to perform
 authentication and data services.  This data is held on behalf of the you, and
 made available at your request.
 </p>

<p>
 We also collect other non-personally identifiable data, which may include your
 IP address and what browser you are using so that we can improve RPX's services
 for you. 
</p>

<h3>Use of Information</h3>
<p>
If provided, we will use your email address to contact you from time to time
and we will use your email address for security reasons to confirm that you are
who you say you are. You can control the types and frequencies of certain
emails you receive, although you agree that we may always contact you to
provide you with important information or required notices required by RPX. 
</p>

<p>
We may use your information (a) to deliver the RPX services and features
desired by you (including any customization features requested by you), (b) to
improve our services to you, (c) to personalize content and offers that may be
of interest to you, (d) to respond to your inquiries, and (e) to fulfill your
request for products or services. 
</p>

<p>
We may use the non-personally identifiable information, like your IP address,
to statistically analyze site usage and to customize our site's content, layout
and services. The resulting information will allow us to improve our services
and better understand and serve our users. 
</p>

<p>
We do not sell customer lists. We will not share any information that
identifies you personally with any third party for marketing purposes. We will
disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we
are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or to
protect our rights and property or the rights and property of the public. We
may also cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any official investigation
and we may disclose your personally identifiable information to the relevant
agency in doing so.
