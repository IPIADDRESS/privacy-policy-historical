<p>We do not share Personal Information with Third-Party Ad-Servers; however, Third-Party Ad-Servers may automatically collect Non-Identifying Information about your visit to the Site and other websites, your device address, your Internet Service Provider and the browser you use to visit the Site. They do this by using Cookies, clear gifs and other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visits to the Site and the other websites tracked by these third parties. This Privacy Statement does not cover the collection methods or use of the information collected by Third-Party Ad-Servers, and RTI is not responsible for Cookies or clear gifs in third party ads. We encourage you to review the privacy policies or statements of these third party advertising companies to learn more about their use of Cookies and other technologies.

<h2>5. How RTI Collects Information</h2>

<p>You provide us with your Personal Information when you register, subscribe, or otherwise when you provide us with your Personal Information during your interaction with the Site. We also collect Personal Information when you contact us online for customer service and other support using self-help tools, such as email, or text.</p>

<p>We also receive Personal Information and other online and offline information from Other Sources. RTI will use such information in accordance with applicable laws. Such information, when combined with Personal Information collected as provided in this Privacy Statement, will also be handled in accordance with this Privacy Statement. We also use cookies, tags, web beacons, local shared objects, files, tools and programs to keep records, store your preferences, improve our advertising, and collect Non-Identifying Information, including Device Data and your interaction with the Site.</p>

<p>We use Cookies that contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your Site activity with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with the Site. We use session cookies on a temporary basis, such as to manage your view of pages on the Site. We use persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided, and storing your preferences. Information from Cookies also tells us about the website you were visiting before you came to the Site and the website you visit after you leave the Site.</p>

<p>When you access these pages or open email messages, we use Pixel Tags and Web Beacons to generate a notice of that action to us, or our Vendors. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve the Siteâs pages.</p>

<p>Device Data may be collected when your device interacts with the Site and RTI, even if you are not logged into the Site using your device. If you have questions about the security and privacy settings of your mobile device, please refer to instructions from your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.</p>

<h2>6. Security</h2>

<p>We use commercially reasonable security procedures to protect personally identifiable information that you provide to us. While we consider these procedures to be adequate, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of storage, is completely secure. Therefore, there is still a risk that your personally identifiable information could be misappropriated and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h2>7. Accessing and Correcting Personal Information</h2>

<p>We will retain and use your Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<h2>8. Privacy Practices of Third Parties</h2>

<p>This Privacy Statement only addresses the use and disclosure of information by RTI through your interaction with the Site. Other websites that may be accessible through links from the Site may have their own privacy statements and personal information collection, use, and disclosure practices. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy statements provided by these other parties prior to providing them with information.</p>

<h2>9. Notice to Residents of Countries outside the United States of America</h2>

<p>RTI is headquartered in the United States of America. We recognize that the European Community has established a data protection regime pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC (the âDirectiveâ). The Directive applies to the European Economic Area (âEEAâ). Switzerland has also established a data protection regime pursuant to the Federal Act on Data Protection (âFADPâ). These regimes restrict companies in the EEA and Switzerland (collectively, "EEA/CHâ) from transferring personal data about individuals in the EEA/CH to the United States, unless there is âadequate protectionâ for such personal data when it is received in the United States. To create such âadequate protectionâ and allow our Vendors to overcome the restriction on international data transfers established by the Directive and the FADP, we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by US Department of Commerce (âSafe Harbor Principlesâ ) with respect to personal data about individuals in the EEA/CH that our subsidiaries and Business Partners in the EEA/CH send to us, (âEEA/CH Dataâ). More information on the Safe Harbor Principles and RTIâs scope of participation is available at http://export.gov/safeharbor/.</p>

<p>If you live outside the United States (including in the EEA/CH), and you use the Site or provide us with Personal Information directly via the Site, your information will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Statement. By using the Site or giving us your Personal Information, you are directly transferring your Personal Information and Non-Identifiable Information to us in the United States. The United States may not have the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction. However, you agree and consent to our collection, transfer, and processing of your Personal Information and Non-Identifiable Information in accordance with this Privacy Statement. You are solely responsible for compliance with any data protection or privacy obligations in your jurisdiction when you use the Site or provide us with Personal Information. Regardless of where we transfer your information, we still protect your information in the manner described in this Privacy Statement.</p>

<h2>10. Childrenâs Privacy</h2>

<p>RTI does not intend that any portion of the Site will be accessed or used by children under the age of thirteen, and such use is prohibited. The Site is designed and intended for adults. By using rti.org, you represent that you are at least eighteen years old.</p>

<p>Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California can obtain certain information about the types of personal information that companies with whom they have an established business relationship have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.

<h2>12. Do Not Track</h2>

<p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there currently isn't an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don't respond to them at this time. We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.</p>
