		Many of the children who work on the porous Pak-Afghan border have to face many problems including physical abuses and mental tortures, locals and social workers say.
Since 9/11 after,the business activities increased on Pak-Afgan border, many Pakistani and Afghan children who had no other resources to make both ends meet, flocked to Torkham border in search of jobs. Though they manage to earn some money by doing daily-wage job, they are mentally and physically tortures by their employers and other stakeholders. </p>
