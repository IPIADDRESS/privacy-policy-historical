RTÉ respects the privacy of all visitors to our website. This Privacy Statement outlines our policy concerning the collection and use of personal information which is gathered by RTÉ from users of this website. We may update our Privacy Statement from time to time to reflect any changes in technology or legislation which may affect the way in which we process your personal information. In addition, RTÉ is not responsible for the privacy practices of any external websites which may be accessed through your use of this website and so we would advise that you review the privacy statements of those websites as they may be subject to different privacy requirements. Any processing of personal information gathered by RTÉ as a
result of your use of this website is governed by the provisions of the Irish Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.
<br>
<br>
In general, any information you provide to RTÉ will only be used within RTÉ and by its agents and service providers. Your information will be disclosed where we are obliged or permitted by law. Also, if you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on or to RTÉ.ie or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on RTÉ.ie, RTÉ can use whatever information that is available to it about you to stop such behaviour.
