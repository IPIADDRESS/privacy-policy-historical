        <li>This policy covers how Rentalo treats personal information that Rentalo 
          collects and receives, including information related to your past use 
          of Rentalo services. Personal information is information about you that 
          is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or 
          phone number, URL, and that is not otherwise publicly available. </li>
        <li>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Rentalo 
          does not own or control, or to people that Rentalo does not employ or 
          manage. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subtitle">Confidential Information Collection and Use </p>
      <p class="resalt">General </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rentalo collects personal information when you 
          register or add a rental inquiry or a property listing at rentalo.com. 
          Rentalo may combine information about you that we have with information 
          we obtain from business partners or other companies. </li>
        <li>When you register we ask for information such as 
          your name, email address, URL, and personal interests. Once you register 
          with Rentalo and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.</li>
        <li>Rentalo collects information about your transactions 
          with us, including information about your use of the services that we 
          offer. </li>
        <li>Rentalo automatically receives and records information on our server 
          logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, 
          and the page you request. </li>
        <li>Rentalo uses information for the following general 
          purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill 
          your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact 
          you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal 
          and external clients. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="resalt">Children</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When a child under age 13 attempts to register 
          with Rentalo, we ask that he or she have a parent or guardian to obtain 
          parental permission.</li>
        <li>Rentalo will not contact children under age 13 
          about special offers or for marketing purposes without a parent's permission.</li>
        <li>Rentalo does not ask a child under age 13 for more 
          personal information, as a condition of participation, than is reasonably 
          necessary to participate in a given activity or promotion.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subtitle">Information Sharing and Disclosure</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rentalo does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you

              establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; 
            </li>
            <li>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, 
              prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected 
              fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety 
              of any person, violations of Rentalo's terms of use, or as otherwise 
              required by law. </li>
