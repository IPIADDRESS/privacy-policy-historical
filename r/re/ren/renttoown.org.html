<meta content="RentToOwn.org is the web's top destination for rent to own homes. Users are able to read about the rent to own process and the multiple options to structure a lease-to-own contract. People that would normally rent houses can connect with agents that represent owner financing homes. In addition, RentToOwn.org contains a countrywide database of over one million affordably priced homes, houses for rent, and foreclosures. Rent to own is a concept that represents more than just a creative real estate structure. Rent to own is about improving your financial profile, taking proactive strides towards becoming a homeowner.  A lease to purchase agreement is not a great fit for all aspiring homeowners. We recommend that most website visitors continue to rent houses while raising their FICO and accumulating more cash savings. Due to the significant deposit and rental rate premium typically required with rent to own homes, these deals can be a large financial risk. Houses for rent are a better alternative for renters with low FICO scores and high unsecured debt balances. As our visitors begin the Smart Path to Homeownership we recommend they speak with our credit improvement and debt settlement partners to develop an action plan. RentToOwn.org represents more than simply a rent to own real estate website; it is a one-stop destination for renters that are serious about becoming homeowners. RENT TO OWN" name="description">
