	<p><span class="style1"><b><font size="3">PRIVACY STATEMENT</font></b></span></p>
	<p>WilComp complies with all United States state and federal law.  For customers who reside outside of the United States, WilComp complies with the standards set by the relevant European Union Directives. WilComp  provides a business service to our customers. WilComp  will only use the information you provide for the purposes intended and as detailed in the Privacy Statement unless we have obtained your consent to use it for other purposes.<br> <br>
WilComp respects the privacy of every school and person that entrusts their information with us or who visits our website and uses our services. This Privacy Statement outlines the information that will be collected and how we will use that information.   <br><br>
We have developed our privacy policy from industry guidelines and standards, and local, national, and international laws and requirements. All privacy practices and methods described herein only apply insofar as permitted by applicable standards, laws and requirements.  The fundamental principles of our privacy policy are:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Data will be processed fairly and lawfully. </li>
		<li>Data is collected for specified and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a way that is incompatible with those purposes. </li>
		<li>The data collected will be maintained in a secure manner based on industry standards and best practices for the security and the protection of data.</li>
		<li>Data will not be shared with any third party without the consent of the owner of the data unless required in support of the school, or to complete a transaction on behalf of the owner of the data such as a payment transaction, or is required by law, warrant, subpoena or similar legal process.</li>
	</ol>

You may update your contact information or opt out of receiving marketing or promotional materials by contacting our Customer Support center by phone at +1&nbsp;866&nbsp;800&nbsp;6593, or via email request sent to <a href="mailto:privacy@renweb.com">privacy@renweb.com</a>.</p>
	<p>When a school becomes a customer of WilComp, the school administration will be required to submit information regarding your business, its staff members and clients (parents, guardians, students and other associated parties).  This information will be managed on your behalf within WilComp product databases by means of our software interfaces,  the information itself remains the property of the client school as the owner of the data.

Staff members who wish to review or update their personal information may do so by contacting the school administrator responsible for maintaining such data using WilComp software interfaces.  In addition, confidential information generated in the course of business, such as student evaluations and electronic communications, are acknowledged to be the intellectual property of the WilComp client school.  <em>WilComp will not share personal information pertaining to school administrators or staff members with anyone outside of our company, subject to the limitations described above.</em></p>

	<p>WilComp respects all applicable national and international children's privacy regulations.

	<p>It is the responsibility of our client schools to utilize our services (e.g. the collection of information from students by means of customer-designed web forms) in a manner that complies with FERPA and similar regulations unique to the jurisdiction within which our client schools operate.</p>

	<p><span class="style1"><b><font size="2">Access to Customer Information:</font></b></span></p>
	<p>The primary goal of WilComp in collecting personal information from our customers is to assist our customers in managing the information they provide utilizing our products and services.  We have always safeguarded the confidentiality of information provided to us by our clients and are bound by our professional standards to continue to maintain this vital aspect of our professional relationship.  The following individuals may have access to some or all of your information:
	</p><ol>
		<li><b>Employees of the company</b>: Employees who need such information to conclude a transaction or provide technical support for which the customer has engaged WilComp </li>
		<li><b>Service Providers</b>: As with any business, other service firms may need access to certain information at very specific times and for very specific reasons. An example might be consultants that must have access to certain client records in order to increase the efficiency of our computer processing systems. We have and will always insist that any such information that needs to be disclosed for any business purpose be considered confidential and not used for any purpose other than the specific business need. That well-understood business policy of confidentiality will be reinforced as needed by contractual agreements with any service provider having access to your data.</li>
	</ol>
<p></p>
	<p>WilComp will share the information necessary to deliver products and services that you specifically request to receive but we will limit this information to only what is necessary and required to complete a transaction. WilComp also reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information in order to respond to duly authorized information requests of governmental authorities, where required by law, when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, warrant, subpoenas or similar legal process. <em>WilComp will not share, trade or sell the personal information of our visitors or customers for use by any business without your consent.</em></p>

	<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. <em>We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</em> </p>

	<p><span class="style1"><b><font size="2">WIDGETS </font></b></span></p>
