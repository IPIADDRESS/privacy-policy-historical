<p>Yardi Systems, Inc. and its affiliated entities (“Yardi”) is
committed to protecting the privacy of individuals and achieving and
maintaining the trust of our clients (“Yardi Clients” or “Clients”) and other
users of and visitors to Yardi websites (collectively, “Visitors”). Central to
this mission is providing a robust security and privacy program that carefully
considers data protection matters across the suite of products and services
offered by Yardi (“Yardi Services” or “Services”), including data stored by
Yardi on behalf of its Clients and their customers in connection with our
Services (“Client Data”), as well as the personal data (including such data as
defined by the EU General Data Protection Regulation) provided by Clients and
Visitors who visit <a href="http://www.Yardi.com">www.Yardi.com</a>,
associated Yardi microsites and any other Yardi-controlled websites that link
to this Privacy Statement (collectively, the “Yardi Sites”).</p>



<p><strong>Web Sites
Covered</strong></p>



<p>This Privacy Statement describes our privacy practices regarding
information we collect from individuals (“you” or “your”) who visit the Yardi
Sites. When we collect personal data on the Yardi Sites, certain additional
disclosures, that are specific to the context of our collection and use of the
information being collected (e.g. an event or seminar registration page), may
be provided to you. For the avoidance of any doubt, we will adhere to those
commitments and any such additional privacy policy statements are hereby
incorporated into this Privacy Statement.</p>



<p><strong>IMPORTANT:
THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO CLIENT DATA</strong>. Yardi’s confidentiality/privacy
and other obligations with respect to its Services, and Client Data (as defined
in the agreements for those Services), are governed solely by the agreements
under which the Services are provided to our Clients. The traditional licensees
of Yardi Services are residential and commercial real estate property owners
and property managers (again, collectively, as used in this Privacy Statement,
“Yardi Clients” or “Clients”). The other actors in the real estate economy are,
of course, the residents, tenants and providers of various services for, or at,
the buildings Yardi Clients own and manage.&nbsp;
Yardi Services (by means of example only, the Yardi Voyager web-based,
fully integrated end-to-end platform product suite) help our Clients manage
their real estate and other assets by, among other things, facilitating
communication and transactions between Yardi Clients and their tenants and service
providers. Yardi generally has no direct relationship with the individuals to
whom our Clients’ Client Data may pertain; Yardi merely hosts or processes such
data on behalf of our Clients. Any uses of Client Data by Yardi are done so
pursuant to the subscription agreement in place between Yardi and the relevant
Yardi Client, or Yardi’s applicable Terms of Service, which exclusively govern
Yardi’s treatment of Client Data. This Privacy Statement does not apply to
Yardi Services or Client Data. If you have any questions about the data
practices of a Yardi Client, using Yardi Services to process your personal
information, you need to contact the Yardi Client directly, and ask for their
Privacy Policy or Privacy Statement. In other words, Yardi is a data processor
and not a data controller with respect to Client Data. Yardi Clients make all
decisions about how or why Client Data, containing personal information or not,
is to be processed, including any disclosure or transmission to third parties.
If personal information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted
or entered into a Yardi Service by or on behalf of a Yardi Client, or was
otherwise collected by a Yardi Service on behalf of a Yardi Client, and you
wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend or delete
such Client Data, please inquire with the Yardi Client directly. If an
authorized Yardi Client requests that we update or remove the data in question
and the Client has no ability to do so via use of the Services, we will
acknowledge their request within 30 days.</p>



<p><strong>Web Sites
Not Covered</strong></p>



<p>Some Yardi Services enable Yardi Clients to create websites and
applications that run natively on the Yardi platform. One such example are RENT<em>Café</em> resident portals, which facilitate
communication and transactions between Yardi Clients and their potential or
actual tenants. Such websites are controlled by Yardi Clients, and as described
above, any information submitted to or collected by such websites is Client
Data to which this Privacy Statement does not apply. The terms of service and
privacy policy of the third party Yardi Client governs such websites.</p>



<p>Yardi is committed to promoting privacy principles and providing
as much information to individuals as legally and contractually possible about
the processing of their personal data. In that light, some Yardi
Client-controlled websites that are created and maintained by Yardi Services
may include privacy statements directly from Yardi to the users of such
websites. Yardi is committed to adhering to such privacy statements. We provide
these statements, or disclosures to identify Yardi as the data
processor/technology platform, to disclose Yardi’s privacy practices with
respect to such Client Data, and to inform the user to seek information about
the privacy practices governing the website directly from the corresponding
Yardi Client. To be clear, Yardi’s privacy statements on such Yardi Client
controlled websites are applicable only to Yardi, and not the Yardi Client. In
such privacy statements, Yardi discloses how Yardi uses and processes the
information collected by and submitted to the website controlled by the Yardi
Client. For the avoidance of any doubt, if you submitted personal data to a
Yardi Client-controlled website created and maintained by Yardi Services (e.g.
RENT<em>Café</em> resident portals) and you
wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend or delete
such Client Data, please inquire with the Yardi Client directly.</p>



<p>Some Yardi Sites may be created and managed by Yardi Clients. Most
of these websites are not accessible via the public internet. Regardless,
please know that this Privacy Statement is not applicable to those websites,
which are instead governed by the privacy statement of the Yardi Client that
creates and manages the website. In addition, the Yardi Sites may contain links
to other third-party websites. The information practices or content of such
other websites is governed by the privacy statements of such other websites.
Yardi encourages you to review the privacy statements of such other websites to
understand their information practices.</p>



<p><strong>Information
We Collect</strong></p>



<p><strong>Personally
Identifiable Information</strong>. Yardi collects personally identifiable
information on this Site only if you provide it. This may include, but not be
limited to: the process of registering to attend an event, applying for
employment with Yardi or by contacting Yardi for some other reason through a
web form. In these cases only, we will require you to provide information
necessary to fulfill your request, such as your name and email address.</p>



<p><strong>Generic
User Information</strong>. As you navigate the Yardi Sites, Yardi may
also collect generic user information through the use of commonly-used
information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons. This information
includes standard information from your Web browser (e.g. browser type and
browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, the URL of the page
that referred you and the actions you take on the Yardi Sites (e.g. the web
pages viewed, the survey responses you submit, the links clicked, etc.).</p>



<p><strong>Cookies</strong>. This website uses cookies so that we can provide you with the best user experience possible. Cookie information is stored in your browser and performs functions such as recognizing you when you return to our website and helping our team to understand which sections of the website you find most interesting and useful. You can adjust all of your cookie settings. </p>



<p><strong>How We Use
Information We Collect</strong></p>



<p>Yardi uses the information you submit on the Yardi Sites solely to
perform the services or activity being requested and to present its content to
you. However, personal data will never be sold or rented. We may use third
parties to perform services related to the services or activity requested, such
as payment processing for any applicable fees associated with an event or
transaction. These third parties have access to the information you submit only
to perform these tasks on our behalf.</p>



<p>Generic user information is referenced only to help us improve the
usability of the Yardi Sites. You may be able to restrict the use of cookies by
adjusting your browser’s privacy options.</p>



<p>Yardi, like all organizations, is a data controller of its
employees’ personal data that is processed as part of its human resources operations.
If you are a Visitor located in the European Economic Area, Yardi Systems,
B.V., is the data controller for any personal data collected on the Yardi Sites.
For additional information about Yardi’s privacy practices relating to applying
for a job at Yardi, please visit our <a href="https://careers.yardi.com/privacy-policy/">Yardi Careers Privacy Policy</a>
(which is hereby incorporated by reference).</p>



<p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the information and personal
data described in this Privacy Statement will depend on the information or personal
data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we
will normally collect personal data from you only where we have your consent to
do so, where we need the personal data to perform a contract with you, or where
the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data
protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may
also have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you.</p>



<p><strong>Public Forums
and Customer Testimonials</strong></p>



<p>Yardi may provide bulletin boards, blogs or chat rooms on Yardi
Sites. Any information or personal information you choose to submit in such a
forum may be read, collected or used by others who visit these forums, and may
be used to send you unsolicited messages. Yardi is not responsible for any information
or personal data you choose to submit in these public forums.</p>



<p>Yardi may post a list of clients and testimonials on Yardi Sites
that contain information such as client names and titles. Yardi obtains the
consent of each such person prior to posting any information on such a list or
posting testimonials.</p>



<p><strong>Information
We Share</strong></p>



<p><strong>Service
Providers</strong></p>



<p>As described above, Yardi may share your personal data with
contracted service providers so that these service providers can provide
services on our behalf. Yardi does not share, sell, rent or trade any personal
data to or with third parties for their promotional or marketing purposes.</p>



<p><strong>Yardi
Affiliates</strong></p>



<p>Yardi may share your personal data with affiliates of Yardi for
the purpose of any necessary collaboration. For example, Yardi may need to
share your information with an affiliate for job application and employment
purposes.</p>



<p><strong>Yardi
Successor</strong></p>



<p>Yardi may share your personal data with a buyer or other successor
in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization,
dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of Yardi’s assets, whether
as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding,
in which personal data held by Yardi about our Visitors is among the assets
transferred.</p>



<p><strong>Compelled
Disclosure</strong></p>



<p>Yardi reserves the right to use or disclose information and
personal data provided on the Yardi Sites if required by law or if Yardi
reasonably believes that such use or disclosure is necessary to protect Yardi’s
rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal
process.</p>



<p><strong>International
Transfer of Information</strong></p>



<p>To facilitate Yardi’s global operations, Yardi may store, transfer
and access the information and personal data you submit on the Yardi Sites
around the world, including the United States, Canada and other countries in which
Yardi or its third party service providers have operations. This Privacy
Statement shall apply even if Yardi transfers such information or personal data
to other countries. By registering to attend an event, contacting us through
our web form or providing information or personal data to us on any Yardi Sites
in any other context, you consent to the transfer of your information and
personal data among these facilities, including those located outside your home
country.</p>



<p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we will
comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the
transfer of personal data to recipients in countries outside of the EEA. In all
such cases, we will only transfer your personal data if:</p>



<p>The country to which the personal data will be transferred has
been granted a European Commission adequacy decision;</p>



<p>The recipient of the personal data is located in the U.S. and has
certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework; or</p>



<p>We have put in place appropriate safeguards with respect to the
transfer, for example the EU Model Clauses.</p>



<p>You may request a copy of the safeguards that we have put in place
in respect of transfers of personal data by contacting us as described in the
How to Contact Us section below.</p>



<p><strong>Communications
Preferences</strong></p>



<p>Yardi offers Visitors who provide contact information a means to
choose how Yardi uses the information provided. You may manage your receipt of
marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe”
link located on the bottom of Yardi’s marketing emails. Additionally, you may
specify your communications preferences using our Privacy Feedback form. Yardi
Clients cannot opt out of receiving transactional emails related to their
account with Yardi or the Services.</p>



<p><strong>Your
California Privacy Rights</strong></p>



<p>As already stated elsewhere in this Privacy Statement, and in
accordance with California Civil Code Section § 1798.83, please know that Yardi
does not disclose personal data collected on the Yardi Sites to third parties
for their direct marketing purposes. (California Civil Code Section § 1798.83
permits users of a website that are California residents to request certain
information regarding the disclosure of personal data to third parties for
their direct marketing purposes).</p>



<p><strong>Children Under
the Age of 16</strong></p>



<p>Yardi Sites are not intended for children under 16 years of age.
No one under age 16 may provide any information to, or on, any Yardi Sites. We
do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 16. If you are under
16, do not use any Yardi Sites, and do not provide any information via any
Yardi Sites. If we learn we have collected or received personal data from a
child under 16 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that data.
If you believe any Yardi Sites may have collected personal data from or about a
child under 16, please contact our Legal Department at (800) 866-1124.</p>



<p><strong>Rights of
Individuals</strong></p>



<p>Visitors who wish to correct, update, change, or erase the personal
data they submit on any Yardi Sites should be able to go back to the applicable
registration page or web form to edit their user or organization record. However,
some of the information voluntarily submitted that is not personal data, such
as a response to a poll or a survey, is typically aggregated and thus not
correctable, updatable, changeable, or erasable. For additional information or
problems accessing your information from such page, call us at (800) 866-1124,
or contact us using our <a href="https://www.yardi.com/about-us/privacy-statement/privacy-statement-feedback/">Privacy
Feedback</a> form.</p>



<p>If you consider that we have processed your personal data in
violation of applicable law and failed to remedy such violation to your
reasonable satisfaction, you may also lodge a complaint with the data
protection supervisory authority in your country.</p>



<p><strong>Data
Retention</strong></p>



<p>Yardi retains the personal data we receive on the Yardi Sites for
the duration of your relationship with Yardi, plus a reasonable period
thereafter as necessary to fulfil the purposes described above. Retention
periods may be extended if we are required to preserve your personal data because
of litigation, investigations and other similar proceedings, or if a longer
retention period is required or permitted by applicable law.</p>



<p><strong>Security</strong></p>



<p>Yardi is committed to protecting the security of any personal data
you provide to us.&nbsp; Yardi uses
appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security measures to
protect any such information you submit. Despite these protections, no one,
including Yardi, can guarantee the security of any data submitted over the
Internet.</p>



<p><strong>Copyright Policy</strong></p>



<p><strong>Reporting
Copyright Infringement Claims</strong></p>



<p>Yardi respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our
users, property managers, owners, and commercial brokers to do the same. Yardi
has implemented procedures for receiving written notification of claimed
infringements and for processing such claims in accordance with the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Section 512 (“DMCA”). </p>



<p>If a third party believes that its work has been copied in a way
that constitutes copyright infringement, or its intellectual property rights
have been otherwise violated, it should provide the designated agent with the
following information: (i) an electronic or physical signature of the person
authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual
property interest; (ii) a description of the copyrighted work or other
intellectual property that it claims has been infringed; (iii) a description of
where the material that it claims is infringing is located on the Yardi Site;
(iv) its address, telephone number, and email address; (v) a statement that it
