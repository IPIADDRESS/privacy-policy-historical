Irvine also may obtain non-personal information from social media platforms, vendors and other third parties, such as Google, Inc. (“Google”) and the operators of other websites or applications that run on mobile devices and tablets (“applications”) that you have visited, some of which partner with Irvine or with a display network utilized by Irvine, and may share information as permitted in such third party’s privacy policy. Non-personal information may also be obtained from inferences based upon the sites you visit, third party data, information you share on other websites, social media platforms and applications, or demographics derived from profiles you create, such as a Google profile.</p>
<p><strong>i. Cookies and other “Collection Technology”</strong></p>
<p>Non-personal information may be collected in a variety of ways, but Collection Technology is often used. “Collection Technology” refers to cookies, web beacons, pixels, gifs, tags and other technologies that collect information in similar ways. Collection Technology such as a cookie may store a piece of data on your browser or device, while other forms of Collection Technology may identify your browser or device and/or collect information through other means. When you visit the Websites or another website or application where an Irvine ad appears, your browser or device may be exposed to Collection Technology and Collection Technology may be stored on your browser or device, which may provide Irvine with non-personal information about you.</p>
<p>You may delete and/or refuse the use of certain Collection Technologies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. You may use the Websites even if you choose to refuse or delete such Collection Technologies; however please note that this may affect your ability to use the full functionality of the Websites.</p>

<h3>10. Links</h3>
<p>On our Websites, you may have the opportunity to follow a link to other sites that may be of interest to you. Irvine endeavors to link only to reputable organizations. Because these other sites may not be hosted or controlled by Irvine, however, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites or the content provided thereon. Collection Technology also may be used by some of those other sites.

<h3>12. Changes To This Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>The Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time as we add new features and services, as laws change, and as industry privacy and security best practices evolve. We display an effective date on the upper left corner of the Privacy Policy (“Last Revised Date”) for you to know when there has been a change. Accordingly, you should check the Privacy Policy on a regular basis for the most current privacy practices. Each time you access, use or browse the Websites, you signify your acceptance of the then-current changes to the Privacy Policy applying to your personal information collected by us on and from the effective date of such changes.</p>
<p>Any changes in the Privacy Policy will take effect upon posting and apply only to information collected from you on and after the Last Revised Date, unless we provide notice or have other communications with you.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without regard to choice of law principles. Those who choose to access the Websites from locations outside of the United States do so on their own initiative, and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable, including without limitation, all applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding the transmission of data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside. Irvine may limit a Website’s availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction, at any time in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>Personal information collected through the Websites and other aspects of Irvine’s business may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Irvine or its affiliates, subsidiaries or Service Providers maintain facilities.
