    		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>Last Updated: April 14, 2009</p> 
			<p>This Privacy Policy describes how RentJuice Corporation (“We,” “Us,” or “Our”) protects your privacy when you use the Web site located at www.rentjuice.com or any of our widgets or applications (collectively, the “Site”).</p> 
			<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information (including, personal information) collected through the Site. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us. This Privacy Policy is part of and incorporated into the <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a> of the Site.</p> 
			<h2>RENTJUICE.COM’S PRIVACY PLEDGE TO YOU</h2> 
			<ul> 
				<li>We are committed to protecting your privacy while allowing you to use the Site.</li> 
				<li>You may add, delete or modify your personal information at any time.</li> 
				<li>Subject to your permission or as specifically stated in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell, exchange or otherwise share your personal information with third parties.</li> 
				<li>We do not send spam, maintain spam mailing lists or support the activities of spammers.</li> 
			</ul> 
			<h2>YOUR CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2> 
			<p>By using the Site, you are agreeing to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Site or any of the products or services offered via the Site. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@rentjuice.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy">privacy@rentjuice.com</a>.</p> 
			<h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ON THE SITE AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</h2> 
			<h3>Active Collection of Information</h3> 
			<h4>Agents and Agencies</h4> 
			<p>Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit the Site or use any of the products or services offered via the Site. We may collect certain information that you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information. For example, we may collect your name, email address, user name, telephone number, credit card account number when you register, set up an account, contact us by e-mail or use our products or services. When you provide us with your credit card account number, you may elect to make it only valid for your use and/or your agency’s use. If you decide that your credit card account number can be used by your agency, any agent within your agency may make charges against your credit card account number using our products or services. When a credit card account number is used, the applicable credit card owner will be notified via e-mail.</p> 
			<p>Personal information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection your participation with the interactive areas on the Site. Agents can upload photos, which can only be seen by other agents in their agency. However, if an agent desires, such uploaded photos can be made available to the public directory of real estate agencies, which is visible to any user of the Site.</p> 
			<p>From time to time we may collect personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, promotional offers, and other activities on the Site.</p> 
			<p>We may also collect photos from you, which can only be seen by agents in your agency. You may choose, however, that the photos be shown in the public directory of real estate agencies, which may be seen by any visitor to the Site.</p> 
			<h4>Renters</h4> 
			<p>We may collect personal information about you from the agents and agencies that visit the Site. We may use this personal information to contact you on behalf of agents to coordinate on housing rental process tasks or communicate with you about future products.</p> 
			<p>Additionally, if an agent or agency requests a credit report concerning you, we may collect your social security number. We will store your social security number in our database for only as long as the application is pending. Once the application is completed, we will request a credit report from our vendors and then remove your social security number from our database.</p> 
			<h4>Landlords</h4> 
			<p>We may collect personal information about you from the agents and agencies that visit the Site. We may use this personal information to contact you on behalf of agents to coordinate on housing rental process tasks or to communicate with you about future products.</p> 
			<p>Additionally, if you submit a listing to an agency via the Site, we may send the listing to a third party in order to convert it to a specific format. We, or a third party, will then input the data from the listing in the converted format into the application for the agency to which you submitted the listing.</p> 
			<h4>All Users</h4> 
			<p>When you use our support services, we collect your correspondence in order to build up a public knowledge base, which will be available to all users of the Site. Your correspondence will not be used verbatim, but likely paraphrased in an FAQ format.</p> 
			<h4>RentJuice RealTime</h4> 
			<p>If you use the RentJuice RealTime service, we will collect your profile information and information with respect to your listing(s) including, but not limited to, photos of the unit(s) and features of the unit(s). Such information will be shared with the people you invite via the RentJuice RealTime service.</p> 
			<h3>Passive Collection of Information</h3> 
			<p>We may collect information that is sent to us automatically by your Web browser, such as your IP address, the address of the Web page you were visiting when you accessed the Site or an advertisement hosted by us on a third party Web site, information on your operating system and browser, and the date and time of your visit. The information we receive depends on the settings on your Web browser.</p> 
			<p>The information provided by your browser does not identify you personally. We use this non-personal information primarily to create statistics that help us improve the Site and our business. In addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we might share our server logs – which contain visitors’ IP addresses – with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use such information to trace and identify individuals.</p> 
			<p>More specifically, when we collect information regarding your recent activity on the Site, we may use it in different ways. Some of the information is only use to enhance your browsing experience (such as, displaying your recently viewed listings or landlords). Other information is saved to a news feed which is displayed to other agents in your agency (such as uploading photos, adding or deleting listings and closing a listing).</p> 
			<p>Like many commercial Web sites, we use “cookies,” and similar technologies to collect information and manage the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies cannot be used to install computer programs or deliver viruses to your computer. We use cookies to track your sessions on the Site. This tracking enables us to enhance your browsing experience.</p> 
			<p>You may delete our cookies as soon as you leave the Site. Although you are not required to accept our cookies when you visit the Site, you will only be able to log into your account and certain other portions of the Site if the cookies are enabled.</p> 
			<p>We may use Web beacons on the Site and may permit third parties to place them on the Site to monitor the effectiveness of the Site and its contents. A Web beacon is a small, invisible graphic image that may be used on the Site or in emails relating to the Site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Site.</p> 
			<h2>STORAGE OF INFORMATION</h2> 
			<p>Most of the information we collect is retained by us in our database, except for social security numbers which are only temporarily retained. Also, credit card information is never stored on our servers for an extended period. Instead, credit card information is stored using a feature provided by certain of our vendors.</p> 
			<h2>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2> 
			<p>We use the information collected through the Site: (a) to communicate with you; (b) to process your requests and transactions; (c) to improve the Site; (d) to customize the services and/or products we provide to you; (e) to assist with our product and service development; (f) to perform marketing analysis; (g) for the creation of our public directory; and (h) for other purposes related to our business.</p> 
			<p>Also, we may use the information we have collected together with information collected by a partner, advertiser or other person/entity with whom you or we do business.</p> 
			<h2>WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2> 
			<p>We share information collected through the Site with companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf. For example, we share credit card numbers with our credit payment processing vendor, and social security numbers and basic contact information with our credit and background data technology providers. This sharing is only done for transactional purposes, and the information is not used by these parties for anything other than providing specific services to us.</p> 
			<p>Also, we may disclose the personal information we collect through the Site when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to: (a) comply with applicable law (or a court order or subpoena); (b) prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (c) enforce the Terms of Service of the Site or other agreements that govern your use of the Site and/or our services; (d) to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users or others; or (e) to protect your vital interests. Personal information submitted to the Site or collected by us is our asset and will become part of our normal business records. Your personal information and other data collected by us may be transferred to another company that has acquired our stock or assets, for example, as a result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation. If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company’s use of your personal information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.</p> 
			<p>We do not sell, rent or lease collected information (including, but not limited to, email lists, customer lists, personal profiles, etc.) to any third parties.</p> 
			<h2>MODIFYING YOUR INFORMATION; OPT-OUT / OUT-IN</h2> 
			<p>We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use and disclose your personal information. You may update or modify your information or change your privacy preferences at any time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@rentjuice.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy">privacy@rentjuice.com</a> or, in some instances, via the Site.</p> 
			<p>If you wish to have your name removed from any of our mailing lists, please write to us at our below address. In the event that you contact us with this request, all reasonable efforts will be taken to ensure that you will not receive any further communications from which you have opted-out in the future.</p> 
			<p>If you opt-in, we will share your information with select companies that may make available to you products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. However, we will not share any of your information with such companies unless you have opted-in.</p> 
			<h2>TRANSFER OF DATA ABROAD</h2> 
			<p>If you are visiting the Site from a country other than the country in which our Web servers are located (currently United States of America) the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By visiting the Site and communicating electronically with us, you consent to the processing and transfer of your data as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p> 
			<h2>SECURITY</h2> 
			<p>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.</p> 
			<p>We have endeavored to put into place reasonable security measures in an effort to protect personal information while it is under our control.</p> 
			<p>When you log in, provide credit card numbers, complete credit reports, send information to us during the registration process or access your account information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) encryption software that makes unauthorized access more difficult. In addition, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the Site by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused. If you have any questions about our security practices, feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@rentjuice.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy">privacy@rentjuice.com</a>.</p> 
			<h2>LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</h2> 
			<p>The Site and various advertisements hosted by us, if any, may contain links to Web sites that are not operated by us. These links are provided for your reference and convenience only and do not imply any endorsement of the activities of these third party Web sites nor any association with their operators. We do not control these Web sites and are not responsible for their data practices. We urge you to review the privacy policy and security practices posted on any Web sites you visit before using the Web sites or providing any personal information about yourself.</p>

			<p>THIS SITE IS NOT MEANT FOR MINORS. We are committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests. The Site and our services are not intended for and may not be used by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and we do not target the Site or our services to children under 13.</p> 
			<p>We may not intend to collect or solicit information from people who are minors. However, as a condition of use for minors in those countries or regions where information gathering from minors is considered illegal, guardians will be responsible for accompanying minors for prevention of any unexpected circumstances when they access the Site.</p> 
			<h2>NO SPAM</h2> 
			<p>We are opposed to spam. Our No Spam Policy and Terms of Service prohibit all users from engaging in any activity involving spam. Violations of these policies may result in immediate termination of service and legal action against any spammer. Terms of Service expressly prohibit users from uploading, posting, emailing, transmitting or otherwise making available junk mail, commercial advertisements or other form of commercial solicitation on the Site or through our services. Any unauthorized use of the Site or our services is a violation of our policies and certain federal and state laws. Such violations may subject the sender to civil and criminal penalties.</p> 
			<h2>GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY</h2> 
			<p>You should be aware that, as with all legal contracts, our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy could be amended, terminated or modified without the consent of you and/or us by judicial proceeding, court order, in connection with bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, or pursuant to other government action. When reasonable and lawful, we will notify you if this occurs.</p> 
			<h2>THIS PRIVACY POLICY MAY CHANGE</h2> 
			<p>We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version of this Privacy Policy on the Site. Your use of the Site following any such change constitutes your agreement that all personal information collected from or about you through the Site after the revised Privacy Policy is posted on the Site will be subject to the terms of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
