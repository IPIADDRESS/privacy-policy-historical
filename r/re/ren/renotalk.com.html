What about Cookies?<br>

Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your
computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web
more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular
site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major Web sites
use them to provide useful features for their customers. Cookies in and of
themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a
user's computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If
you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, you may not be
able to take full advantage of a Web site if you do so.
<br><br>

What about the registration information?<br>

renotalk.com site's registation form requires you to give us contact
information (like your name and email address) and unique identifiers (like
a password). Unique identifiers (such as passwords) are collected to verify
your identity in our system. By registering, users can take advantage of
personalization (the ability to select content according to a user-supplied
profile) as well as to gain access to other parts of the website like the
Forums. This is information which does not personally identify you, but
which may be helpful for improving the community services. Generally, this
information is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of
"Cookies" "IP addresses" or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.

operating environments that are not available to the public.
<br><br>

How else might someone learn of my Personal Information while visiting
another site?<br>

also provide Personal Information through e-mail exchanges, message boards,
forums, classifieds or bulletin board use made available to you on other
sites. Chat sessions and bulletin board or newsgroup use is considered
public and you are responsible for your actions in these areas. The
renotalk.com Privacy Statement does not cover this type of transfer of your
Personal Information. You should always be careful when distributing your
Personal Information in this manner.
