            <h2>Testimonials</h2>
<p>"I have been using Rental Systems since 2004 and it has enabled me to radically improve my company. Bookings are handled efficiently and professionally with minimal input. Double bookings are a thing of the past, and there is no need to chase clients for balance payments as it’s all done for you! Our agency has grown from 20 to nearly 200 properties without the need for extra staff. This could not have been achieved without Rentalsystems.com. The fact that all our properties also get exposure on Villarenters.com is also a huge plus. Thanks for a great system”.
<br><strong>Jon Stewart, Tenerife Holiday Homes</strong>
</p>

<p>I have five properties with Rentalsystems (since 2007) and I've not considered using another booking agent since I signed up.  The system is simple to use and takes care of all the admin duties of bookings, leaving you free to do other things.  Transactions are processed quickly and the guests rarely complain about late payments for refunds or damage deposits.  The online chat assistant is helpful and always ready to deal with questions.  Rentalsystems has helped me grow my business without the need for investing in my own booking system and the stress that goes with it.  The commission rate is competitive and keeps me from considering other agents or payment processing companies.  Rentalsystems acts as a great middle man between guest and owner, creating a professional and trust worthy interface which encourages more bookings.
<br><strong>Graham</strong>

<p>"I've just hit 1 full year in villa ownership and have to say that your web site is the best of the lot that I advertise with and I've had more bookings through you than all of the many other sites that I advertise on put together. I have total belief in your site, to the point that I went with your calendar on my personal web site. I've have just purchased a second villa....... and hopefully will make the majority of bookings through you" 
<br><strong>Avi Kochar</strong>
</p>

<p>"I just wanted to say how pleased I am with your service. I am a single Mum and I rent out my home in Italy over the summer months. This year I have solely listed with Rentalsystems and I am almost fully booked through to October. It has been easy to use and I feel secure and payments are swift. The people who have visited us have been wonderful. I can't thank you enough." 
<br><strong>Dorothy</strong>
</p>

<p>"The icing on the cake is the booking system which enables me to take bookings from around the world and at a much lower cost than having my own merchant account with a credit card company. The automated booking system is professional and the documentation produced is ideal if clients need to claim on their insurance. Keep up the good work!" 
<br><strong>Jean Didwell </strong>
</p>

<p>"What I really like is the booking system, the automation of the system is second to none. Thank You."
