<br>
<li>
Communications and Communication Tools.
<p>
RentalHouses.com communicates with users, and facilitates communications between users, in a variety of ways, including but not limited to:

We make tools available that facilitate communications between Renters and Lessors by phone or email. When these tools are used, we may collect certain information related to the communication, like email addresses, contact logs, calling number, call duration, contents of the email communication, and (when notified during the call) call recordings. We may share this information with Lessors so they can manage their communications with Renters, and we will use this information to enforce our rights to collect fees payable by Lessors.
</p>
<br>
<p>

We provide all users with the opportunity to opt out of receiving non-essential (promotional, marketing-related) communications from us. To remove your contact information from RentalHouses.com lists and newsletters, you can click on the “unsubscribe” link that is included at the bottom of any RentalHouses.com email you receive.

We use session cookies, which are deleted when you log out of RentalHouses.com or browse to a different website, to monitor and improve the functionality and usability of the Website. You can block our cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help), but doing so may prevent us from delivering certain services to you.

We may use third-party advertising companies such as Cross Pixel Media, DoubleClick or Yahoo! to serve ads on our and our advertising partners’ behalf.

Third Parties.
<p>
Except as otherwise expressly included herein, this Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are Renters and Lessors or other websites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them.

<br>
<p>
RentalHouses.com has links to other websites that may collect personal information about you. RentalHouses.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those linked websites.

<br>
<li>
Security.
<br>
<p>
Your information (other than credit card or bank account information) is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use many tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from RentalHouses.com. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
