				<p>By using IIC's web sites or the RentometerPro software application found at Pro.rentometer.com site, you signify your acceptance of our Privacy Policy and the specific purposes for which IIC may collect, use and disclose your personal information as set forth herein. If you are an IIC RentometerPro subscriber or User, you have provided a Login Name and Password that allows you to sign in and access http://pro.rentometer.com. This Login Name and Password enables you to log in to IIC's pro.rentometer.com web site, and it also serves as the only means of authenticating your identity on IIC's http://pro.rentometer.com web site and as an authorized User of RentometerPro. You should not give your Login Name or Password to a third party - anyone who has your Login Name and Password can log in to Pro.rentometer.com and view all information that you have stored in your portfolios. Whether you choose to search or browse or to login as a User at IIC's http://pro.rentometer.com site, you are consenting to the terms of this Privacy Policy and any other terms that you have accepted or agreed to as part of subscribing to using or licensing RentometerPro. IIC will not, as a condition of the licensing of a product or supply of a service, require an individual to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information greater in scope than that required by IIC to fulfill the specified and legitimate purposes for which it was collected. If an individual consents to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and upon reasonable notice to IIC, an individual may withdraw his or her consent at any time by contacting IIC's Privacy Officer. IIC will inform an individual of the implications of withdrawing consent, including but not limited to the loss or inaccessibility of any personal information or other data that may be stored in your RentometerPro account at http://pro.rentometer.com.</p>
				<br>

				<h3>LIMITING COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE</h3>
				<p>The RentometerPro software site permits Users to store information with IIC, as part of the use of the site, and to make such information accessible to third parties chosen by the User. Except for information selected and stored by Users in Pro.rentometer.com, IIC will limit its collection of personal information to the amount and type of personal information which it needs for its identified purposes, and IIC will only collect personal information by fair and lawful means and not indiscriminately. Personal information will only be used or disclosed for the purposes for which it was collected, except with the consent of the applicable individual (which consent is implied by use of Pro.rentometer.com for delivery of information to User-selected third parties) or as permitted or required by law.</p>
				<br>

				<h3>COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION</h3>
				<p>In order to ensure that IIC's web sites are useful and effective for its Users, IIC uses log files to analyze information. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track visitor's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. These types of log files are not linked to personal information. IIC uses these statistics to improve site content and usability; this information does not identify visitors personally. Visitors are not required to be IIC or Pro.rentometer.com subscribers in order to gain access to IIC's public web sites, with the exception of specific secured pages. However, when a User enters an IIC subscriber Login Name and Password in order to access to Pro.rentometer.com or other secured pages, a "cookie" may be deployed. If the User clicks "Save Login Information", the User Login Name will be saved in a "cookie" - a small text file stored on the visitor's browser - on the User's computer, so that the User will not have retype the Login Name the next time the User visits the Pro.rentometer.com web site. In addition, the Pro.rentometer.com web site uses the "Secure Sockets Layer" security protocol ("SSL") - a standard industry security technology that protects web communications. The pro.rentometer.com server will write a "temporary cookie" to the User's computer. This cookie enables the web site to "remember" this authentication information during movement from one page to another during a session. This makes it unnecessary to log in again on each page. The temporary cookie only saves assigned identification information for the session and contains no personal information.

The following paragraphs of this Section of IIC's Privacy Policy ("Accuracy and Right of Access") only apply to personal information other than that stored by Users in the Pro.rentometer.com software site. IIC will use reasonable efforts to ensure that other personal information under its control is as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.

				<h3>LINKS</h3>
				<p>IIC's web sites contain "links" to other sites, including sites operated by IIC affiliates or their agents. Subscribing Users have the ability to store their own selected web site links in Pro.rentometer.com, as a link in their RentometerPro custom public real estate website available for their individual marketing needs. IIC does not control, and is not responsible for, the content, accuracy, timeliness, security, or the continued availability or existence of outside information.

IIC cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these organizations directly if you have any questions about their use of the information they collect. INFORMATION PROVIDED IN ELECTRONIC PORTFOLIOS TO THIRD PARTIES; RISK OF DISCLOSURE Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information to third parties through electronic communication - by providing email messages, or granting permission to any person to view and have access to your real estate advertisements - that information can be collected and used by others, including making copies or printing of such information and forwarding such information and access to your advertisements or publicly available domain to others. By granting and enabling permission for viewers to view your electronic advertisements, such information, including any sensitive personal information, may be stored, copied, printed, used, published and/or forwarded to others by the viewer, and the privacy of such information cannot be protected. By including sensitive information, such as that pertaining to racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, financial information, or health or sex life, in any electronic advertisement or publicly available domain, you are providing explicit consent to the disclosure of that sensitive information to any viewers that have been granted permission to view your advertisements or public sites.

				<br>

				<h3>SECURITY</h3>
				<p>Access to a User's RentometerPro portfolios, maintained by IIC, is password-protected so that only the subscribing User may create and manage the User's portfolios. As described above, however, public viewers will have access to any real estate advertisement and real estate marketing pages and viewers may have the ability to provide feedback and inquiries on properties advertised to the subscriber who created the real estate advertisement or public marketing site. IIC may store and process personal information provided by Users, through such Users' subscription to or use of RentometerPro, in the United States or any other country where IIC, its affiliates, agents or transferees are located. IIC staff will have access to Users' portfolios for service, support and maintenance purposes. A subscribing User may edit the User's own information stored in the User's portfolios at any time by logging in with his or her Login Name and Password. IIC strongly urges subscribing Users to not divulge their Login Name and Password to anyone, and to not enable any login storage feature of any web browser or software program, which would permit anyone with access to the subscriber's computer to have access to the subscriber's personal RentometerPro account. IIC also urges Users to completely close their web browser window when they have finished visiting the Pro.rentometer.com web site. This is to ensure that others cannot easily access personal information if the computer is shared or is used at a public place. Subscriber credit card and payment information is not stored in a database or on any servers connected to the Internet. This is to provide the best protection of subscriber payment information. Credit card data transmission in the subscription process is encrypted using SSL or other encryption techniques. IIC has physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in place, including an Information Security Policy, to protect personal information provided to IIC or stored in Pro.rentometer.com from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, alteration and destruction. Although there cannot be a guaranty of the security of personal information provided by Users to IIC or stored in Pro.rentometer.com, IIC believes that its security policies and safeguards are reasonable and appropriate to adequately protect such information, regardless of the format in which such information is held. IIC intends to review and update its security policies and safeguards on a regular basis. IIC requires that its employees keep all personal information confidential and comply with its Information Security Policy and privacy practices. IIC uses reasonable efforts to ensure that upon disposal or destruction of personal information, confidentiality of the information is maintained.</p>
